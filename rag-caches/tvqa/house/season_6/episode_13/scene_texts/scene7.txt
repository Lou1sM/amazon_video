Stan : I don't understand how it's even possible. I've checked it twice.
Cuddy : How much?
Stan : Ten cases.
Stan : Ten cases?
Stan : Going back three years.
Cuddy : What the hell have you been doing, Stan?
Cuddy : You're supposed to be managing this place.
Stan : All the paperwork I signed was correct.
Stan : She must have altered the orders afterwards.
UNK: Didn't you ever cross check it with the bills that came in?
Stan : I delegated it.
Cuddy : To whom?
Stan : To Gail.
UNK: Well, she seemed perfectly trustworthy, how was I supposed to know?
Cuddy : By doing your job! Sorry.
Cuddy : Have you notified the DEA? The DEA?
Cuddy : Jeez, Stan, hello!
Cuddy : You don't steal $50,000 worth of pills because you want to lose weight.
Cuddy : She's supplying a meth lab. Just get her back in here.
Oscar : All right. Now.
UNK: Well, you ever want a job, trust me.
Eli : He'll double whatever you're making here.
UNK: I take it he liked my proposal.
Eli : Enough to tell me to get my ass back over here today.
Eli : Here. He's willing to go to 8%.
