Foreman : Anything abnormal on the MRI?
UNK: Man At Faire : God's teeth! What strange manner of garments be these?
Foreman : Okay. We'll be back soon.
UNK: Man At Faire : He consorts with tiny demons in his hand. 'Tis witchcraft, I say.
Foreman : Do I look like I'm here to play pretend with you?
UNK: Relax. It's not personal.
Thirteen : Just tell them you're a time traveler or something.
Thirteen : Well, if we're gonna be here, we might as well enjoy it.
Foreman : Our knight just vomited inside the MRI.
Foreman : Taub thinks it might be food poisoning.
Foreman : Which shouldn't be surprising.
Foreman : Outdoor latrines, food prep going on next to livestock.
Miles : I hear you wish to speak with me concerning Sir William.
Miles : How faireth he?
Foreman : Not well, or we wouldn't be here.
Miles : A pox indeed is... Miles.
Shannon : We just thought it was a concussion.
UNK: He's going to be okay, right?
Thirteen : We need to look at the area he was camping out in.
Foreman : And you might want to invest into a dental plan for the kingdom.
Miles : You sure he got sick from something here?
UNK: I'm not sure of anything, yet, but...
Foreman : What do you make of this?
UNK: Mmm. Looks like vomit.
Thirteen : Means he was showing symptoms prior to the fight.
Foreman : True, but I meant this.
Miles : Oh. It's a cow eye from the night before the tournament.
Shannon : He makes the knights eat all kinds of disgusting stuff.
UNK: Why?
Shannon : Got the idea from Fear Factor.
Foreman : Why didn't he mention it when he checked into the hospital?
Miles : I make them all take an oath of secrecy about the ritual.
Miles : William tends to take his role as a knight very seriously.
Shannon : You think that's what caused him to pass out?
UNK: It's not exactly sanitary.
House : Fun stuff never is.
