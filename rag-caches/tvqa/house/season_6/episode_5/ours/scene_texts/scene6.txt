House : Can we cut to the money shot?
House : It's his heart, so let's look at his heart.
House : Nice Y-incision.
Foreman : You can't perform an autopsy without a medical license.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Because I don't think there's anything I can screw up
House : that we haven't already screwed up.
UNK: Opening post-mortem incision,
Foreman : beginning at the mid-line of the sternum.
Foreman : That's odd. It almost looks like he's bleeding.
House : I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.
Foreman : He was briefly conscious,
Foreman : then his systolic dipped below 60 and he was out again.
Foreman : Differential diagnosis for resurrection. Go.
UNK: Obviously, he wasn't dead.
Foreman : His heart slowed enough that the EMTs could think...
House : Yes, the fact that he's not dead
House : means we did absolutely nothing wrong.
UNK: There are several documented cases
Cameron : where tetrodotoxin ingestion caused apparent death.
Foreman : It wasn't something he ate, it's something he already had.
Chase : And his dad, and his grandpa, and...
Foreman : Extreme bradycardia could be caused by sick sinus syndrome.
Chase : Sinoatrial block.
House : What if it's not his heart?
UNK: Let's work from the tenuous assumption that we're not idiots.
UNK: You spent days examining a heart up, down, and sideways,
UNK: declaring it healthy just a few hours before it basically shut down.
UNK: So we need to think about causes in places you didn't look.
Chase : Could be metabolic.
Wilson : You okay?
UNK: Yeah.
Foreman : What about a genetic predisposition to an autoimmune disease?
Foreman : Isolated Anti-Ro Antibody could cause complete heart block.
Cameron : Could also be passed through four generations.
House : Autoimmune it is. Start him on steroids.
UNK: Hey. How are you feeling?
Donny : My whole head is killing me.
Cameron : You just came through a severe trauma.
