House : We said we'd never to go to sleep angry!
Taub : We did find an arrhythmia, but it's not from your arteries, they're clean.
Bill : Will the pain come back?
Thirteen : We'll start her on cardiac meds, that should help.
Thirteen : But we still need to figure out what's causing the arrhythmia.
Russ : Hey, Valerie.
UNK: Russ.
Bill : It's so nice of you to stop by.
Russ : I got lots of free time now.
Valerie : You don't blame me, do you?
Valerie : You were drunk in front of Norris.
Russ : No, no, no, no, no. I'm drunk now.
Russ : Then, it was like someone poisoned me or something.
Thirteen : Maybe you should come back later.
UNK: Okay.
Russ : I just wanna say goodbye.
Valerie : Okay, Russ. Thank you for coming by.
Bill : Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?
Russ : You poor son of a bitch.
Russ : She doesn't love you any more than she loved me.
Thirteen : Okay, you need to leave right now.
Bill : You're pretending you had an affair with my wife?
Russ : Yeah, we're all pretending. You got nothing to worry about.
UNK: Tell them where you were six months ago, Russ.
Russ : I had a breakdown. I had some paranoid tendencies, as they say.
Russ : But it turns out, I had a right to be paranoid.
Valerie : You need help.
Taub : Get him out of here.
Russ : Okay. Okay.
Valerie : Oh, my God.
Valerie : Are you okay? You okay?
Valerie : Yeah, I'm okay.
Taub : We'll keep an eye out. He's not getting back in the hospital.
Valerie : He's making all that up. You know that, right?
