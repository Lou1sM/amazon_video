Chase : He's been divorced three times,
House : he slept with a dying patient.
House : Sure, he looks like a Boy Scout, but that...
House : The aneurysms look mycotic,
House : but they're not, they're inflammatory.
UNK: Because it's not a fungal infection.
House : The hypertension was a real symptom.
House : You've been unwittingly treating it with beta-blockers.
House : You stopped taking them and your blood pressure went up.
House : It's Hughes-Stovin.
Mickey : Okay, so how do we treat this?
Chase : We don't.
Chase : Hughes-Stovin is an autoimmune disease.
Chase : Once it's this advanced, there's not much we can do.
House : The aneurysms keep multiplying.
UNK: Eventually, one of them will rupture.
Marco : Are you sure?
House : If you die in the next day or so, I will be.
Thirteen : Even if you had told us everything we wanted to know,
Thirteen : it wouldn't have made a difference.
Thirteen : You did the right thing.
Mickey : I think I should call my wife now.
Nora : I'm sorry about your patient.
House : He died a hero in his own mind.
UNK: I guess it's better than nothing.
Wilson : Ran into Nora in the elevator.
Wilson : She no longer thinks we're gay,
Wilson : now she thinks we're mendacious dirtbags.
UNK: Mendacious dirtbag comes much more naturally to me.
UNK: At least we can get rid of that.
Wilson : I kind of like it.
Wilson : Unlike this sofa.
House : It's 500 bucks.
UNK: And it reclines.
UNK: One singular sensation Every little step she takes
House : I will punch you in the face.
Wilson : I'll stop if you get rid of the sofa.
House : No chance.
UNK: One thrilling combination Every move that she makes
UNK: One smile and suddenly nobody else will do
