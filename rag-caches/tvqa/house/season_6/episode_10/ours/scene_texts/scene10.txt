House : For real.
House : Wilson thought you were cute,
House : I was just yanking his chain.
House : Maybe that's not the best phrasing.
Nora : So you were only spending time with me to screw with him?
House : God, no. I was spending time with you
House : because I want to touch your boobs.
House : Enough to listen to Evita, twice, and I really hate Evita.
House : That's how much I like your boobs.
UNK: Wait. Wait, wait.
House : Wilson, he's a really good guy and he really likes you.
Nora : Well, it's really...
Nora : It's sweet of you to stick up for your friend like that.
Nora : And you're still trying to sleep with me.
Nora : Maybe I will call him, it would serve you right.
House : Wilson's a jerk, too.
Nora : At least he tried to do the right thing.
