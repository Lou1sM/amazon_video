Taub : Yeah. You did?
House : As I'm sure your wife did.
House : So we all know they're doing a Fourth of July theme.
House : She'll be expecting something star-spangled.
UNK: Nicole?
UNK: Yes.
Cotter : Cotter Macklin. I'm an old friend of Ted's.
UNK: Hi.
Cotter : How's he doing?
Nicole : He had a heart attack.
Nicole : Oh, my God.
Nicole : They have him on some new meds, really knocked him out.
Cotter : Well, how are you holding up?
Nicole : I'm okay. Thanks.
Cotter : I brought this for him.
Nicole : That's his favorite thing in the whole world.
Nicole : I know.
Nicole : You weren't at the wedding, were you?
UNK: No, I wasn't invited. Ted and I had a falling out.
Nicole : How did you know each other?
Cotter : We met senior year of college.
UNK: Yeah, we shared a house for a while.
Nicole : You were roommates.
Cotter : For three years.
Cotter : I'm sorry. I just miss him.
Nicole : I think you should leave.
Cotter : I shouldn't have done that. Now.
UNK: Please?
Cotter : I hope he gets better.
UNK: Hey. How are you feeling?
UNK: Mmm. Don't know yet.
Taub : Your numbers look good. We're gonna keep you on these meds.
Nicole : You had a visitor while you were asleep.
Ted : Oh, yeah? Who?
Nicole : Cotter. Who is he?
Ted : I shared a house with him after college.
Ted : I don't know why he would show up.
Nicole : That's it? Yeah.
Ted : Why What did he say?
Nicole : I need to hear it from you, Ted.
Ted : One night, I got really drunk and I went to bed.
Ted : And he came into my room,
UNK: and one thing led to another.
Ted : The whole thing was a mistake.
Nicole : Are you saying you had sex with him?
Ted : I was drunk and confused...
House : You're gay?
UNK: No.
Ted : I thought I was.
Ted : I even made up my mind to tell my family.
Ted : I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, psyching myself up.
UNK: But all I could see was disgust.
Ted : And that's when I realized
Ted : I didn't hate the thought of admitting I was gay because I was ashamed.
Ted : I hated the thought because I wasn't gay.
Ted : And that was the day I went to get help.
Nicole : So you're not gay?
Ted : They cured me, Nicole.
Ted : That's what all the head trauma is about.
Ted : I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it's all in the past now.
House : It doesn't matter anymore.
Nicole : What is it?
Ted : Oh, my head!
Chase : He's got severe headaches.
House : So do I.
