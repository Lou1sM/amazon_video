UNK: Esteban, hope you're getting ready.
UNK: Hmm.
House : I met the neighbors.
UNK: Police Officer : Sir, do you know this man?
Cuddy : I don't need a temporary. I need a permanent.
UNK: Yesterday.
Cuddy : Please do.
House : Good morning. Hardly.
Cuddy : One of my PAs quit an hour ago,
Cuddy : and I have to reshuffle next month's schedule.
House : That's nothing. I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.
UNK: Nurse Jeffrey : Any bed you're in is the wrong one.
House : That's not what your mama said. Oh, snap.
UNK: Nurse Jeffrey : I'll be going now. To human resources.
House : He started it.
UNK: I was in the neighbors' kid's bed.
House : Luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with Mommy.
Cuddy : How drunk were you?
UNK: About yay drunk.
Cuddy : Are you okay? You shouldn't be drinking at all, much less...
House : You sound just like Esteban's mom.
Cuddy : I need you in the clinic.
House : Sorry, I'm busy.
House : Tell me you have a case. You know, even if you don't.
Chase : I have a case.
House : Sounds interesting. I'll take it.
House : I owe you one. Now tell me you don't have a case.
Chase : I really do have a case.
House : We're even.
House : You guys know how to honeymoon.
Taub : This is Dr. House.

House : It's Greek for "having the vapors."
UNK: We ruled out all the common causes of fainting,
UNK: low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, dehydration.

UNK: Police Officer : Do you know what it is?
House : Roll on your side and lift up your gown.

Nicole : A test for what?
UNK: Faking.
UNK: Ow!

Ted : I wasn't faking. My voice just came back right now.
