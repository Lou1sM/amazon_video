House : Yes, assuming the biopsy

Taub : Why us?
UNK: Juniority. Welcome back.
Chase : What do you want us to do?
House : Same as me. Have a happy Thanksgiving.
Sidas : I'm not an alcoholic.
Taub : Yes, you just hide vodka around the house for fun.
Sidas : I drink, just not a lot.
Dara : Since when do you drink at all?
Sidas : I have one shot when I get home from work, baby. That's it.
Thirteen : So why lie to your wife about it?
UNK: Because it's not important.
Sidas : What difference does it make?
Dara : That you drink every day, by yourself?
Sidas : I have one lousy drink, okay?
Sidas : Have you ever seen me drunk? Ever?
Dara : No, but you've obviously been drinking enough to hurt your liver.
Sidas : My liver is fine. Hold still.
Taub : There we go.
Sidas : This test is a waste of time.
UNK: Hey. This wine?
Lucas : All right. Very good. There, we got this...
Woman : String beans?
UNK: Julia?
UNK: House Sitter : No, I'm the house sitter.
UNK: House Sitter : They're in Hawaii for the week.
House : Happy Thanksgiving.
House : Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.
House : Happy Thanksgiving.
Chase : Cheers. Cheers.
UNK: House Sitter : You must be Dr. House.
UNK: House Sitter : I was told I should offer you a turkey sandwich.
Thirteen : Tuna salad. Closest thing they had to turkey.
Taub : Thanks. But I'm hoping I can still get out of here
UNK: and catch the tail end of dinner with my wife.
UNK: Anything?
Taub : No cirrhosis, no scarring, no infection.
Thirteen : Blood panel? Elevated albumin, 7.2.
Sidas : That's it? Everything else is fine.
