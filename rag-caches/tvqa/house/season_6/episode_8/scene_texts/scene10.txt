Sidas : It's been a while since I had a stimulating conversation.
House : So what are you going to do?
Sidas : Go back to my life.
Cuddy : Which one?
Sidas : The one that has my wife in it.
UNK: Robotripping.
UNK: How does she feel about that?
Sidas : Well, she doesn't have to know. It's worked for 12 years.
House : Tell your brain I said goodbye.
UNK: Einstein's giving himself a lobotomy,
Taub : and you're cool with that?
House : Ignorance is bliss.
Taub : Hold that pose.
Taub : I'll start with t-shirts and mugs and see how it goes.
Taub : Home early.
Rachel : What happened to him?
Rachel : You beat up House?
Taub : Just one right hook.
Rachel : Why? What happened?
Wilson : You were right.
Taub : I told him we need to lay down some ground rules, it got a little heated.
Rachel : That's not what I meant. Is he okay?
UNK: Are you going to be fired? Arrested?
Taub : Everything's fine.
UNK: Wow.
House : Dr. Cuddy.
House : Can we at least be civil?
Cuddy : How's your nose?
Sidas : It's okay.
House : Does your kid like animals?
House : I got tickets to that holiday carnival.
House : I hear they have a nice petting zoo.
Cuddy : I think I was pretty clear before.
House : I don't mean with me.
UNK: Here. Take them. Enjoy.
Cuddy : No, thanks.
House : They're not fake. I didn't steal them.
House : One of the nurses was selling them for her kid's scout troop.
House : I know it doesn't make things right between us,
House : but I just wanted to do something nice.
Cuddy : I don't want them.
UNK: Okay.
Cuddy : I'll see you tomorrow.
House : They didn't split up.
House : She wouldn't take the tickets.
Wilson : Of course. Windtalker code for "we never split up."
Wilson : House, she told you multiple times
Wilson : she wants nothing to do with you.
House : I wasn't gonna be there.
House : She just felt guilty that I felt guilty, so she couldn't take them.
Wilson : Either that or she didn't want to appease you.
House : These weren't reparations,
House : just a simple gesture of remorse, and she slapped it down.
House : They didn't break up.
House : She just wanted me to think that, so I'd back off.
Wilson : Dare I ask what you're gonna do?
UNK: Nothing.
House : I said they'd either break up or they'd stay together.
House : They didn't break up.
Wilson : And you're okay with that?
House : It is what it is.
Wilson : Good for you.
Cuddy : House knows I lied.
UNK: Why? What did he say?
UNK: Nothing. I could just tell.
UNK: You gonna stage another breakup?
UNK: No.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Hi.
Cuddy : It seems like he's going to leave us alone.
UNK: Mmm. Why would he do that?
Cuddy : I'm not completely sure.
Lucas : So, we have his blessing?
Cuddy : I guess so.
Lucas : I made you some eggplant Parmesan.
UNK: And maybe House isn't so bad after all.
Cuddy : That would be nice, wouldn't it?
