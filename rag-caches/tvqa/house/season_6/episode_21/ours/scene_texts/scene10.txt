Foreman : There's no way to prevent a fat embolism.
Foreman : Even if you'd done this in an OR,
Foreman : you couldn't have saved her.
Foreman : You can't blame yourself for her death.
Foreman : This wasn't your fault.
House : That's the point!
House : I did everything right. She died anyway.
UNK: Why the hell did you think that would make me feel any better?
Foreman : You shouldn't be alone right now.
House : You're bleeding.
House : I'm gonna give you a task, as an employee.
House : Get out of my way.
Hanna : What's that?
Thirteen : I'm asking for some time off.
Hanna : What's wrong?
Taub : Are you okay?
Thirteen : Obviously not.
UNK: You're gonna leap across the room
House : and grab them out of my hand?
UNK: No.
Cuddy : It's your choice if you wanna go back on drugs.
UNK: Okay.
House : Just so you know, I'm finding it hard to see the downside.
Cuddy : You need to rebandage your shoulder.
House : Is that why you're here? Foreman sent you?
UNK: No.
House : Here to yell at me again?
UNK: No.
House : Well, I'm running out of ideas.
UNK: Lucas...
House : Oh, great.
House : You're feeling uncomfortable again.
House : Probably means you just got back
UNK: for some quickie wedding in Vegas,
Taub : or you're already pregnant...
Cuddy : I ended it.
UNK: What?
Cuddy : I'm stuck, House.
Cuddy : I keep wanting to move forward,
Cuddy : I keep wanting to move on, and I can't.
UNK: I'm in my new house with my new fiance,
Cuddy : and all I can think about is you.
Cuddy : I just need to know if you and I can work.
House : You think I can fix myself?
Foreman : I don't know.
UNK: 'Cause I am the most screwed up person in the world.
Wilson : I know.
Charlie : I love you.
Cuddy : I wish I didn't.
Cuddy : But I can't help it.
House : How do I know I'm not hallucinating?
Cuddy : Did you take the Vicodin?
UNK: Nope.
Cuddy : Then I think we're okay.
UNK: Yeah.
