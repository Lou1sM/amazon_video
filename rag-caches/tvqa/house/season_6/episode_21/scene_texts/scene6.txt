UNK: Do you think we could be friends when I get out of here?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: We'll catch a ball game or a group sex show or something.
UNK: Put it in there.
UNK: Okay, when the beam starts lifting, you're gonna feel pain.
House : It's gonna be like your foot's gone to sleep times a billion.
House : You'll notice that I'm waiting till now to tell you.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : We're ready.
UNK: Lifting.
Hanna : I'm feeling the pain already.
House : That's good. Means the pressure's coming off.
House : Closer to getting out of here.
House : Come on. Help me pull her out.
House : Come on.
Hanna : It's moving!
UNK: Hanna!
UNK: Hanna!
House : What the hell happened?
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : I think the adjacent beam snapped during the lift.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We got a secondary collapse.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : We're all right, how are you guys?
UNK: Rescue 1, copy the mayday.
UNK: Main tunnel looks fine. Red Team is on the way.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : Lift this up.
House : One, two...
House : The kit. Give me the kit.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : All right.
House : No breath sounds on the left side. Tension pneumothorax.
UNK: Hey, Hanna.
UNK: One of your lungs has collapsed.
House : I'm gonna have to reinflate it, okay?
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : Hey, you better get back up top,
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : make sure you didn't nick an artery.
House : I'm gonna have to go.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : It's okay. You're all right.
Cuddy : You're lucky this isn't worse.
Cuddy : You know who's even luckier?
House : You and just about every other human being who wasn't down there.
