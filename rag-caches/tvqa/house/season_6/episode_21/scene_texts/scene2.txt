UNK: Hey!
House : Somebody down here!
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : If you can hear me, tap three times or call out.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : Is anyone there?
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : I'm not getting anything.
House : I heard something. There's got to be a void down there.
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : There's a million voids down there, it was the parking garage.
UNK: But our equipment hasn't picked up any movement,
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : dogs haven't picked up any scent.
House : There's smashed cars down there,
UNK: you don't think that gasoline could throw off their scent?
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : We gotta get back to work, okay?
UNK: Captain Mccreaney : We'll get to this area soon. Excuse me.
House : Anybody hear me?
UNK: Hey! Can anybody hear me?
Hanna : Help me.
House : What's your name?
UNK: Please...
Hanna : My husband's gift...
Hanna : I was supposed to pick it up at the framers. It's on Elm.
House : You should have told me earlier,
UNK: I could've picked it up on the way.
House : What's your name?
Hanna : It's a picture from our Tortola trip for his birthday.
House : I'm not asking your name because I wanna become friends.
House : I'm trying to gauge your mental state.
UNK: Hanna.
House : Okay, that's a start. What day of the week is it?
UNK: Tuesday.
House : Better still.
Hanna : What happened?
House : You know that giant construction crane next door?
