Wilson : That's just the way I am.
Wilson : But still don't know what you're talking about.
Thirteen : Cuddy had IT trace all the IP addresses who've logged into my e-mail account.
Thirteen : There were two. Mine and yours.
Wilson : Obviously House decided he needs you more than he's willing to...
Thirteen : I already asked House.
Wilson : And he'd certainly never lie.
Thirteen : No, he'd lie. Except he wants me gone.
Thirteen : And he'd do a lot better job of lying than you just did.
Wilson : Really? It was that bad?
Thirteen : No, actually.
UNK: But it doesn't matter any more. Why? Because of House or Foreman?
Wilson : You're good for both of them, but Foreman's not my best friend.
Thirteen : House will be fine.
UNK: Maybe.
Wilson : But with you on the team, he'd be better.
Wilson : He needs someone who doesn't need him.
Wilson : You're the only one he's never really been able to suck into his crazy House vortex.
Wilson : Keeps him grounded, his ego in check.
Thirteen : Why didn't you just come to me?
Wilson : I figured you'd only stay if House asked. And I knew he would, eventually.
Thirteen : Bye, Wilson.
Wilson : This is a great job.
Wilson : Maybe even better, now that House is at least trying
Wilson : to have real relationships with people.
UNK: I said trying.
Thirteen : It doesn't matter.
Wilson : The job you love doesn't matter?
Wilson : Don't throw it all away just because of a bad breakup.
Thirteen : Bye, Wilson.
Wilson : I just confessed.
Wilson : I told Thirteen I was the one who canceled the plane ticket.
UNK: Why?
Wilson : You mean why did I confess, or why did I do it?
House : I know you didn't do it, so I guess the first.
Wilson : You want her to stay because you want her back, or because Foreman does?
