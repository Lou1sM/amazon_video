UNK: How are you feeling?
Tucker : Can't complain,
Tucker : considering if it weren't for you, I'd be dead. Twice.
UNK: You?
Wilson : I feel good.
Wilson : Sending out your laundry?
Tucker : Going to rehab. Someplace up in Katonah.
Wilson : Up by your new house, not near your old house.
Tucker : Easier on Ashley.
Wilson : I see.
Tucker : I was thrilled to get the family back together,
Tucker : and Melissa's great in a crisis,
UNK: but the person you want when you're dying
UNK: isn't the same as the person you want when you're living.
Ashley : Hi, Jim.
Wilson : Actually, it's James.
House : You ready to admit that he's a self-important jerk?
Wilson : I still feel good about what I did.
House : You don't feel angry?
UNK: Oh, I'm a little disappointed.
House : Disappointment is anger for wimps.
House : You don't have to be so gentle about everything.
House : It's okay to get angry once in a while.
House : You can't change a table.
House : Actually, you can.
UNK: You just need a coat of paint and the guts to use it.
UNK: Bonnie.
Wilson : Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.
House : You're gonna outbid her?
Wilson : We do need a bigger refrigerator.
Wilson : She hurt my friend. She should be punished.
House : You got mad.
House : I'm proud of you.
House : Cuddy won't share that sentiment.
UNK: How are you going to explain it to her?
Wilson : I'm changing our address to a PO box.
House : She'll find out eventually.
Wilson : A problem delayed is a problem denied.
Wilson : Bonnie? I'll take it.
House : Baby steps.
