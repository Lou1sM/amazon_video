House : As predicted.
House : What did we say we'd move on to?
UNK: Out of body experiences can be induced
Thirteen : by sensory overload in the temporoparietal junction.
Thirteen : Temporoparietal junction was clean on MRI,
UNK: MRA, and whole body scan.
House : Which just leaves us with the question of
House : what happened during the out of body experience?
Taub : If I say her blood pressure shot up over 200 and she bit her tongue,
Taub : would that be a satisfactory answer?
House : Sure. If you then went on to answer the following,
House : did she float above her body? Did she see Jesus?
House : Did she bathe in the Ganges?
Foreman : No, no and no. Can we get back to the medical science?
UNK: No.
Taub : She claims she emerged from her body
Taub : as a younger version of herself and started talking.
Taub : She couldn't remember what was discussed.
Foreman : But I'm sure it wasn't a differential.
Foreman : House, cognitive pattern recognition
Foreman : is 50 years from being a useful diagnostic tool.
Chase : Even if we can get the equipment, it takes hours for the initial mapping.
Chase : If she has another seizure, she could stroke out.
House : Coincidentally, she could also have a stroke if we do nothing.
Foreman : I'm not telling a mother who's scared out of her mind
Foreman : that our best shot is a magic trick.
House : It's not magical, it's experimental.
House : Just like washing your hands after pooping once was.
House : And technically, it's not our best shot.
House : I'm pretty sure it's our only shot.
House : Perfect. So, Foreman, go get her consent.
House : The rest of you, go down to the cog-sci lab.
Chase : The equipment should already be there.
