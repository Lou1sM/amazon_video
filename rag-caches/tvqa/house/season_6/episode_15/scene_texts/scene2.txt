Thirteen : Chase told me. What's the big deal?
Taub : Maybe we can talk about this another time. Or never.
Thirteen : I really don't think she's gonna tell anyone.
Taub : If I admit we were fighting,
Taub : he's gonna want to know what about.
Thirteen : So tell him, or tell him it's none of his business.
Taub : This is easier. Really?
Thirteen : Because it seems much harder.
Thirteen : What do I know? I'm not a guy.
Taub : Yes, if only I could be as open
Taub : about my emotional life as you are.
Thirteen : It's not about the yoga.
Taub : Really? I thought it was, since we spent an hour talking about yoga,
Taub : but what do I know? I'm not a girl.
Thirteen : My guess is she thinks you don't want to spend time with her
Thirteen : because you're spending it with someone else.
Taub : If she thinks I'm cheating, she would ask.
Thirteen : Because you'd tell the truth?
Taub : I'm not seeing anyone else.
Thirteen : Doesn't matter. You have a history.
Thirteen : And that's not her fault.
Taub : So what am I supposed to do? I can't prove a negative.
Thirteen : That is a problem.
Thirteen : There's the heart.
Taub : Valves look fine. No vegetations. No myxomatous changes.
Nick : Can you give her a little more sedative?
Thirteen : She's dissecting. She's rupturing.
Taub : Get the scope out.
Thirteen : This doesn't make sense. Her BP's normal,
Thirteen : and her heart rate was controlled.
Taub : We'll figure it out later.
Taub : We've only got about 30 seconds to get her open.
Taub : No leakage from the cannulation site.
UNK: Nice.
Taub : Let's see if she'll start up.
UNK: Cardiac paddles.
UNK: Charging.
Taub : And go.
Nick : Come on.
UNK: Again. Go.
Taub : Pushing five cc's adrenaline.
Taub : Zap her again. No.
Taub : It's not working. Clear.
UNK: Clear.
Thirteen : Normal sinus rhythm.
Taub : Thank God.
