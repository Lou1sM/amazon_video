Wilson : What did you tell them? I told them the truth.
Wilson : They seemed relieved. Did you tell them how sick their son is?
Cameron : I explained what was going on. Allison, their baby's dying.
UNK: If the parents weren't in tears by the time you left, you didn't tell them the truth.
Cameron : That's not how I see it. Do you want them blindsided?
Wilson : Want them coming up and saying, "My God, my baby died. Why didn't you warn me?"
Cameron : So now it's about worrying about them yelling at us? No.
Wilson : It's about getting them prepared for the likely death of their child.
UNK: If their son dies tomorrow, you think they'll give a damn what I said to them today?
UNK: It's not gonna matter. They're not gonna care. Nothing's gonna be the same ever again.
Cameron : Just give those poor women a few hours of hope.
Jill : Dr. House! Oh, no.
Jill : Dr. House, this is my husband, Charlie.
House : Who told you where my office was?
Charlie : Jill, come on. He obviously doesn't want us bothering him.
House : Ooh, I was trying to hide it.
Jill : Look, Doctor, this is about the mono that you said you thought I had.
Jill : The mono? Yes.
Jill : You know, shouldn't Charlie be tested?
UNK: You know, the test. The blood test.
UNK: Right.
House : Yeah, I'm sorry. I... I sometimes forget patients.
House : I thought you were this idiot who doesn't know how to use birth control.
Charlie : I can't have mono. I don't even feel sick or anything.
House : That's very often the first sign.
House : Call my office in the morning, and I'll schedule you for blood tests.
Jill : Thank you.
Charlie : I'm not even tired. Oh.
Wilson : Find anything yet?
UNK: Oh, just some baby formula being stored under a sink with a dripping faucet.
Wilson : Tap water contamination. You thinking pseudomonas infection?
Cuddy : I was. I wasted a couple of hours chasing it down.
UNK: But, ofcourse, the formula hasn't been anywhere near the babies.
UNK: Huh. Whatever idiot stored them there...
Wilson : All right, we'll figure it out. Just-Just calm down.
UNK: I am calm. Let me know when you're gonna need it.
UNK: Oh, come... I warned you.
Cuddy : I did that calmly.
UNK: Hey. Hi.
Karen : She any better?
UNK: Uh, her fever has been stable the last hour.
UNK: We're not gonna make it, are we?
UNK: Sorry?
Karen : Me and Ethan.
Karen : Our next-door neighbor,
UNK: her little boy died in a car crash,
Karen : and she and her husband split up, like, four months after the funeral.
Karen : It's just, uh, what always happens, right?
UNK: Uh, what happens to patients after they leave the hospital, I don't know,
Chase : but try not to get ahead of yourself.
UNK: Nurse's Voice : Dr. Chase, activity on the monitor.
UNK: How long? I don't know. It just started.
UNK: Pulse? Fluid, wide open.
Chase : Do we have an arterial line? Not yet.
Chase : Let's get a B.P.
Chase : You can't come in here. Is my baby dying?
UNK: - Mrs. Hartig... - Is she dying? - Ma'am, you'll have to leave.
Chase : It's not your baby.
UNK: Ventilate.
Chase : B.P. 60 over 20.
Cameron : Heart rate's 180. Start the levophed.
