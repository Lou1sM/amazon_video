UNK: Hi. Bye.
House : He's screaming. He's fine.
UNK: Good-looking baby.
Cameron : Oh, sorry. Wrong room. We'll see you later.
UNK: Twelve rooms, right? That's it?
Chase : Yep. We've definitely checked the whole floor.
Chase : Good news. No epidemic.
Foreman : Tragic, huh?
House : Overflow rooms, third floor.
Foreman : This imaginary infection has spread to the next floor?
UNK: We were just gonna call. Did he get hot all of a sudden?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, I'll take care of that for you.
UNK: Almost there, honey. Don't worry. We're almost there.
Cuddy : Excuse me! Hi. Hi.
UNK: Intake sent you up here? Yeah, my wife's contractions are less than...
UNK: Okay, Intake messed up. I am very, very sorry.
UNK: Nurse Alpert will arrange for an ambulance...
Cuddy : to take you to Princeton General.
Cuddy : The maternity ward is temporarily closed. We have to leave?
Cuddy : Yes. I am very sorry. Why are you doing this?
Cuddy : You will be there very, very soon.
Cuddy : Happy now? No.
House : But I am interested.
House : Three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms.
Cuddy : - How bad? - Spiking fevers.
Foreman : B.P.'s plummeting. They're barely able to keep systolic up.
UNK: - At this rate, they could be dead in a day. - Where did this come from?
Cameron : Two delivery rooms, four different maternity rooms. No common personnel and no common equipment.
UNK: - There's got to be something in common. - Yeah.
House : That would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.
Cuddy : I'm putting a team together. We're gonna start swabbing.
Foreman : What's she gonna swab? Every respirator, sink, vent, drain in the entire hospital?
Foreman : - That'll take months. - Needle in a haystack.
House : It's worse than that, We don't even know it's a needle we're looking for.
UNK: Then why'd you let her go do it? - Because the hospital is her baby, and her baby's sick.
UNK: If she doesn't solve this soon, her head's gonna explode, and I don't want to get any on me.
House : So let's figure out what's in the haystack.
House : - Differential diagnosis, people. - Parasite.
UNK: - It's spreading too quickly. - Next?
UNK: Virus? - The kids are too sick, and the blood tests showed no lymphocytosis.
Foreman : And they're not responding to acyclovir or ribavirin.
Foreman : If it's some other virus, we'll never find it in time anyway.
House : Which leads us to bacterial infection.
House : It's not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, so we've got something resistant.
House : - The usual suspects? - MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.
UNK: Maybe contaminated food or water source.
UNK: Pseudomonas.
UNK: V.R.E.? "H" flu.
House : Okay. Those are the big ones.
House : Cultures will take 48 hours. Might as well be postmortem.
House : We'll start them on vancomycin for the MRSA and aztreonam to cover the rest.
