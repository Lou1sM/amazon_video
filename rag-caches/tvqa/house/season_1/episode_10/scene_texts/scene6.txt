UNK: - Ah, you're joking. - Well, hard not to.
House : Nothing funnier than cancer.
House : What if it's a tuberculoma? She's living out on the streets, breathing all kinds of crap 24-7.
House : The odds are, she's got T.B. Why can't she have a nice, benign growth to go with it?
Wilson : A solid mass on her ovary. Ovarian cancer's way more likely.
Wilson : You're right. It's not even close.
House : Start her on I.N.H., rifampin and streptomycin.
Cameron : But that's the treatment for a tuberculoma.
House : And what is the treatment for advanced ovarian cancer?
Foreman : Pine box.
UNK: Oncologist to Nuclear Medicine. Oncologist to Nuclear Medicine.
UNK: What are you giving me? A second dose of antibiotics.
Foreman : If you've got a tuberculoma, it should help.
Victoria : I don't have a tuberculoma, do I?
Foreman : Probably not.
UNK: Hey, listen. I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Victoria : I'm sorry I lied to you.
Victoria : I took too much insulin on purpose.
Victoria : I really wanted a place to sleep.
UNK: Were you ever married, Victoria?
UNK: But in the comic, it... Well, it's a comic. Comics are just made up.
Foreman : So who's James?
Foreman : Is he real, or did you make him up?
Jane : He's real.
Foreman : Can I help you find him?
UNK: Oh, the... the light's bright.
Victoria : It's getting brighter... Oh... Ow! Oh!
UNK: Hey, take it easy. Everything's fine.
Victoria : Mr. Fury wants to hurt me! Please help me!
UNK: Doctor! Wait, wait, wait.
UNK: Hold on, hold on. Please turn off the light!
UNK: Please! Oh, God!
Foreman : All right, hold on, Victoria.
Foreman : Hold on. Take it easy. Everything's fine.
Victoria : - It's burning! - Everything's fine, Victoria.
Victoria : It's burning! Hold on.
Victoria : I'm burning! Take a sip, take a sip.
Victoria : It's poison! You gave me poison!
Foreman : Hold on.
Foreman : Take it easy.
Foreman : Hey, turn off that damn light!
Victoria : Help me, please!
Foreman : Take it easy. Take it easy. The bad guys can't get you here. I've got you covered.
UNK: But Mr. Fury's not the bad guy.
Victoria : I'm the bad guy. It's me. I'm the bad guy.
Foreman : It's not a tuberculoma.
Cuddy : Can't be.
House : I didn't know the biopsy was back. Her temperature's 105.
UNK: The treatment's not working. It's cancer.
Foreman : She's dying.
UNK: 105. Good news.
UNK: It's a tuberculoma. How do you figure that? Her temp's through the roof.
Chase : The lab results from the biopsy. It's definitely a tuberculoma.
UNK: So, we're right about the diagnosis,
House : and the treatment for that diagnosis is killing her.
