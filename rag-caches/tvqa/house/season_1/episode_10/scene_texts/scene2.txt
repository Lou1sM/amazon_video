Foreman : Oh, geez.
House : Who is she?
Foreman : Okay, why are we on this case? Just because Wilson asked?
House : - Do I need a better reason? - Well, most people wouldn't . You do.
House : The only thing we know for sure about jane Doe is that her name isn't jane Doe,
House : which means no medical history.
House : Allergies, medication, previous diagnoses, treatment...
House : We have no baseline, no context for medical treatment.
UNK: Wow. Looks just like insulin.
House : Vomit. Still moist.
UNK: - What do you think? Couple of days old? - Ugh! You trying to make me hurl?
UNK: Yeah. And here's the big finish.
UNK: Salty.
House : Chemical imbalance.
Wilson : Low magnesium could cause a twitch. Or high calcium.
House : Or it's a coincidence. The point is, we don't know anything. - So do the M.R.I. Find out.
House : The M.R.I. can wait. Hang a banana bag.
House : Give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance. We'll take it from there.
Wilson : Great. Thanks.
Foreman : Okay, even if she's not faking, what's so fascinating about this case?
House : At the moment, how much you don't want me to take it.
House : That's pretty fascinating.
Chase : Nice likeness of Dr. Foreman.
Chase : In fact, he's never looked better.
Jane : He doesn't like me. I can tell.
Foreman : It's okay. He doesn't like me either.
Chase : Who's James?
UNK: Ow! Pain in your head?
Jane : Get away from me!
UNK: No, no, no, no! - All right, let's cool her out. One milligram Ativan, push.
UNK: No! No, no, no, no, no, no!
Foreman : Hold on.
UNK: Aah! Aah!
Foreman : She bit me!
Chase : Good news is, she's negative for HIV and Hep "C".
UNK: Yeah? I'm getting a tetanus shot. She's getting an M.R.I.
UNK: - There's a two-day wait for nonemergency M.R.I.'s. - She's getting an M.R.I! Then she's outta here.
UNK: But Dr. Terhark specifically said I'd have the M.R.I. at 10 : 00.
UNK: It's almost 11 : 00, and I haven't even had the pre-test yet.
Nurse : Sorry. We're a little backed up.
UNK: Excuse me. You're Dr. Terhark's 10 : 00?
UNK: I'm Angela Whitney. I'm meeting my decorator at 11 : 30.
UNK: She's coming all the way from New York.
UNK: Dr. Terhark promised I'd be home in time.
UNK: Ofcourse.
UNK: She just about prepped for her M.R.I.?
Cuddy : Mrs. Whitney?
Cuddy : You tried to steal someone else's test.
UNK: Dr. Terhark is a plastic surgeon.
