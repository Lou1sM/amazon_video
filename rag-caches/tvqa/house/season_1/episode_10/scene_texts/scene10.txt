House : disorientation, paranoia,
House : ineffectiveness of sedatives, and then hydrophobia.
House : Fear of water.
UNK: Rabies.
UNK: There have only been, what, 10 cases in the last 20 years?
House : Yeah, that's because nonhomeless people, when they get bitten, they get shots.
Foreman : There were bats.
Foreman : She's dying.
Chase : There's no treatment.
Cameron : How much time does she have?
House : A day. Maybe two.
House : And if you don't get your shot in the next, say, three hours,
UNK: I'm gonna have to make another affirmative action hire.
Foreman : Come on.
House : Do it.
Wilson : You want me to talk to her?
Foreman : And say what?
UNK: "There's some experimental treatment that's not gonna work"? No.
UNK: "But don't worry, we can make you comfortable"?
Cuddy : Doesn't matter.
UNK: Now she's gonna die in that room.
UNK: Yeah.
Wilson : That's what you say to her.
Wilson : Keep that there and rest for a minute.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Foreman : Tell House I need to go out for about an hour.
Wilson : She may not have that long.
Foreman : I don't want her to die alone.
Wilson : You're going to find James.
Foreman : I'm gonna try.
Wilson : Well, I must say, he's done a lot with the place.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Hey.
Foreman : This is it.
Wilson : Man. No one's been in here for a long time.
UNK: It's gotta be James.
Foreman : Maybe there's another address.
UNK: That's not James.
UNK: Paul.
Wilson : Paul Furia.
House : Mr. Fury.
Wilson : Her husband.
Foreman : Then who's James?
Wilson : Her kid.
UNK: Aw, I just wanna eat you up. You're so delicious!
Victoria : Aw, look at me.
Victoria : You're just like your papa. Look at you! Just like your dad.
UNK: Foreman.
UNK: Foreman?
Wilson : They're dead.
Wilson : That car crash two years ago...
Wilson : She broke her arm, and they were killed.
Foreman : She was driving.
UNK: James.
UNK: No.
Foreman : It's Paul. Paul?
Victoria : You've come to take me.
UNK: No.
Foreman : I've come to forgive you.
Foreman : It wasn't your fault.
Victoria : I'm so sorry.
Victoria : I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
UNK: Homeless Man : I know.
Foreman : It's okay, Victoria.
Foreman : It's okay.
UNK: Oh.
Wilson : You followed me?
UNK: No.
House : You were wearing rain boots today, but you were parked in the underground garage,
House : so the only reason you'd need boots was if you were hitting the streets.
House : I followed you.
Wilson : Didn't we have a conversation about friendship? Yeah.
UNK: I had some follow-up questions.
House : I've met your parents and your brother.
Wilson : I have two brothers.
House : Why wouldn't you tell me... It wasn't relevant.
UNK: Why not? Because he's not in my life anymore.
House : Well, that's relevant.
Wilson : This was the last place I saw him.
Wilson : Nine years ago.
Wilson : I don't even know if he's alive.
