Foreman : Hang in there.
UNK: Her arrhythmia's stabilized.
Chase : Doesn't make sense. What would push her heart rate over 150? Dehydration?
UNK: Fever? - Unlikely. By themselves, neither one would do it.
Foreman : We must be wrong about the meningitis. Maybe it's structural heart disease.
House : Her heart rate dropped when you administered the adenosine.
UNK: In two seconds.
House : It's still meningitis.
Foreman : If it is, with the delay in treatment, she's... she's got almost no chance.
House : Start the treatment.
Policeman : Read the report. I found her lying on the grass.
House : You should read my reports. I make up stuff all the time.
House : What really happened?
UNK: Well, since it's you...
Policeman : I found her lying on the grass.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: That is a great-looking gun.
Policeman : It's not a gun. It's a Taser.
UNK: It's so cool-looking. What does it do?
House : Fire about 60,000 volts?
House : At least that's what it would take to jack someone's heart up to 150.
Policeman : Okay, okay.
Policeman : Let's just say I tell you what happened. It stays between you and me. Right?
Policeman : I found her lying on the grass.
UNK: Fine.
House : Don't tell me.
House : Tell my friend, Ben Franklin.
UNK: Dr. Wharton to the research lab. Dr. Wharton to the research lab.
House : I watch a lot of cop shows.
House : The good news is, the heart rate thing is not connected to her condition.
UNK: Well, then she's dying, 'cause the meningitis treatment isn't helping her. She's getting worse.
House : Well, that brings us to the bad news.
House : The cop Tasered her.
Foreman : Jerk. Probably couldn't get to his real gun fast enough.
House : First time he hit her in the thigh...
House : and she just kept going, like it was nothing.
House : Right about here.
House : She didn't feel the Taser.
Foreman : Localized numbness? Yeah, in that one spot.
Cameron : The diabetes?
House : I don't think so.
UNK: Well, no alcohol. Not entrapment syndrome.
Foreman : Can't be a vitamin deficiency.
Foreman : We can't chase down every sensory neuropathy.
House : Is that where she bit you? Yeah.
Foreman : What the hell!
House : Can't get angry if you don't feel anything.
House : First, there's localized numbness,
House : then sensitivity to light,
