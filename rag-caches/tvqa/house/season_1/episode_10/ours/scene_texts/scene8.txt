House : Get her in isolation and start her on Ceftriaxone.
House : Either she gets better, or she dies.
House : Let me know which one happens.
Cameron : Oh, my God! She was sedated.
Chase : It must have worn off. I did it myself a half hour ago.
Chase : I'll check the nurse's station.
UNK: Calendraica.
Foreman : She's gonna die out there.
UNK: You don't walk out of a room with 10 milligrams of Haldol in your system.
UNK: You don't walk at all. It was 10 milligrams! I gave it to her.
Cuddy : It doesn't matter! Bacterial meningitis... highly contagious.
Cuddy : If she is out of the hospital, we are so liable.
Wilson : Not to worry. She'll be dead before she can kill anybody.
Chase : Security tape confirms it. She stole some clothes and she's gone.
House : Wrong coat. The cape's in the closet. I had it cleaned.
Foreman : - Funny. - You gonna save her?
Foreman : In her comics, Mr. Fury lives in Sloan Harbor.
Foreman : The night she came in, she was at a rave at 1408 Sloan Street.
House : You've been reading. My, how you've changed.
Cuddy : You are a doctor. Do what doctors do.
Cuddy : Pick up the phone, dial 911, and a cop on the other end does what cops do...
Cuddy : and finds the missing person.
Cuddy : I assume the rest of you have doctor things to do. I know you do.
UNK: Student 2 : - Cacchi-Ricci Disease. - Do you even know what that is?
House : Or are you just guessing everything that starts with "C"?
UNK: Student 2 : The kidney problems could result in weight loss. Cacchi. C-A-C...
Foreman : Oh, geez, she's going alphabetically.
UNK: Student 1 : Doctor, why are you wearing that bird pin?
House : It sets off my eyes.
House : Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House. What brings you to the hospital?
Jodi : My wrist. How did that happen?
Jodi : I was riding the Ferris wheel, and this huge seagull flew right at me.
House : How horrifying.
Jodi : I swung my arm at the bird, but I hit the Ferris wheel.
UNK: Student 2 : She's making it all up?
House : - No, her wrist really does hurt. - I'm not lying.
UNK: Ofcourse you are. You have no idea what happened. You have no memory.
House : Korsakoff's syndrome.
House : Her brain is damaged by excessive drinking or insufficient diet, pretty obviously the latter.
House : She has no new memories, no new ideas.
House : Can't even process that idea.
House : So her brain fills the gaps as best it can using visual clues.
House : The horse on your shirt led her to the riding accident,
UNK: and the surfscene on your clipboard led her to the beach.
UNK: "Korsakoff" doesn't start with a "C".
UNK: I didn't say "C".
House : Or did I?
UNK: Lesson to be learned... treat everybody as if they have Korsakoff's. We all lie anyway.
House : Give her thiamine right away. She'll bounce back pretty quickly.
House : And then get her to eat some cake and ice cream.
UNK: Yes?
UNK: Student 1 : Did you need to be so cruel? I think she's crying.
House : Hi, Jodi. I'm Dr. House. What happened to your wrist?
Jodi : There was this weird old guy. He had a cane.
UNK: See? It's like it never happened.
House : Perfect forgiveness.
Emt : Pulse is rapid. You got a temp?
UNK: Don't know. She's warm, but... Might be something to look into. She has meningitis.
Emt : Sorry. I was more worried about her heart blowing up. Pulse is 150.
Foreman : Rhythm regular? Yeah.
UNK: Ready? One, two, three.
Foreman : - Where'd you find her? - Battlefield State Park.
UNK: She narrow complex? Uh-huh.
Foreman : - She wasn't at Sloan? - She was just passed out on the grass.
UNK: Foreman. I need Foreman.
UNK: All right. Supraventricular tachycardia. Get me adenosine, one milligram, I.V. push.
House : Right away. Thank you.
