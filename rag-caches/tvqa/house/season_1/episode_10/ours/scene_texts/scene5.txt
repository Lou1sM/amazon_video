UNK: You know what? I think I might be coming down with something.
House : Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry.
Cuddy : Oh, yeah. Just walk out. Like I'm not gonna do anything.
UNK: Bye-bye.
Foreman : Working hard?
House : This stuff's pretty good.
UNK: Calendraica works for the Council of Genius.
UNK: Bad guy is Mr. Fury.
House : Fairly generic, no special skills, but apparently very well organized.
UNK: You think you work hard. Try ruling the universe.
Foreman : You trying to teach me something here?
UNK: We got the flowing dress, the ring. Think the patient was married?
UNK: Maybe it was a bad break-up. Maybe he dumped her 'cause she was on drugs.
Foreman : You care about her personal history? No.
House : Question is, why don't you?
UNK: I hate to cite a clichÃÂ¹, but Dad on the streets?
Foreman : - Dad's with Mom. - They're both living on the streets?
Foreman : No. On a pension.
House : So, who pissed you off?
Foreman : Right now, you.
House : Your turn. You gonna tell me why this case?
Wilson : She's my new girlfriend. I'm having a tattoo designed.
Wilson : I was hoping you could find out her name.
UNK: So she's just another sick person that kindly Dr. Wilson has made sure doesn't get lost in the big, ugly system.
Wilson : Yes, I forgot. I need a reason to give a crap.
UNK: You're giving two craps. The metric system always confuses me.
Cuddy : Dr. House?
House : - Time for Girl Scout cookies already? - Get me some thin mints.
Cuddy : Since you're too sick to work in the clinic...
UNK: Okay.
Cuddy : I thought you...
Cuddy : I thought you could do some teaching. Patient histories.
House : My specialty.
Cuddy : When you teach, you learn so much. Don't you think?
House : It's all about the giving back.
House : Good old Cuddy. Always thinking.
House : She assign you a patient to interview?
UNK: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
House : Then why are you still here?
UNK: Why are we on this case? 'Cause Wilson asked House to do him a favor.
Chase : I think House just wants to prove she's sick so Foreman will be wrong.
Cameron : - Oh, you boys. - Hey, I'm just doing my job.
UNK: Whoa.
UNK: Foreman's gonna be so embarrassed when he finds out she's got cancer.
UNK: Ah. I thought you were too sick to be down here.
UNK: I had to get away from those students, so I faked a page.
House : Foreman's parents, happily married, 40 years.
Wilson : Mazel tov. Kein ayin hara.
House : So why does he hate homeless people?
UNK: I mean, if it's an uncle or a grandparent, you'd think he'd use it in his college application essay.
House : Family struggles beats a 4.0 G.P.A. any day.
Wilson : - I think he had a 4.0. - Maybe he's just a snob.
Wilson : You really don't need to know everything about everybody.
House : I don't need to watch The O.C., but it makes me happy.
Wilson : Yeah, delirious. What's the other file?
House : Wilson, James. Boy Wonder Oncologist.
House : You know him?
Wilson : You know, in some cultures, it's considered almost rude for one friend to spy on another.
UNK: Ofcourse, in Swedish, the word "friend" can also be translated as "limping twerp".
Wilson : Did your pager really just go off, or are you ditching the conversation?
House : Why can't both be true? Come on.
Wilson : Solid, noncystic mass on the left ovary.
UNK: Five-by-three centimeters.
Wilson : Central necrosis.
Wilson : The only question is whether she dies in two months or three.
UNK: God. You were right.
Wilson : There's nothing we can do for her here. Might as well put her back on the street.
House : Unless it's not cancer.
