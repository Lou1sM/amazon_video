Wilson : He's got osteopenia. His bones are too thin to fix the arm problem.
House : No. Price is not a problem if you have what I need.
House : Young man? How did you know?
House : Well, if he's an old man, osteopenia would just be a fact of life.
House : You make him comfortable, send him home, which means you're just boring me.
House : So he's young, which means it's most likely caused by cancer.
House : You're here because you haven't found it. Have you looked really, really hard?
Wilson : M.R.I. and PET scan are both negative.
House : Well, how old is he? Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset.
UNK: Ah, let's see.
UNK: "Born 9/21 /77".
House : It's Hank Wiggen?
UNK: And he signed it. Sweet. Yeah.
House : "To Jimmy Wilson, the Cy Young of medicine".
UNK: Did you ask for that? Just the "Jimmy" part.
Wilson : The bone's too thin to support the kind of surgery that would let him pitch again.
Wilson : But if we figure out what's causing the osteopenia,
Wilson : we can reverse the bone damage, then do the surgery.
House : Beat the Yankees and save the free world.
