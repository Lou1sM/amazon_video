House : It's a brave new world, Doc,
UNK: and we are the cutting edge.
House : You are looking at two all-access passes...
House : to paradise itself.
UNK: How much? True cost? No man can say.
Wilson : Could that man's accountant say?
House : One thousand dollars. Whew.
UNK: Friday night. The biggest official monster truck jam in the history of New Jersey.
Wilson : Okay, please tell me you didn't just say Friday night.
House : Whatever you've got, you cancel.
UNK: I can't do it. They only give these tickets to owners.
House : Anytime we wanna be in the middle of the track, we're in the middle of the track.
House : These tickets are so good, we have to sign a release.
House : I mean it. We do this, we could die.
Wilson : I've got the oncology thing. I... I...
Wilson : The rectal cancer lecture... they booked me a year ago. I-I-I-I-I can't get out.
Wilson : There's no way out.
UNK: Fine. I'll ask one of my other friends.
UNK: Huh.
House : What? You're saying I've only got one friend?
UNK: Uh... and wh-who...
House : Kevin in Bookkeeping.
Wilson : Okay, well, first of all, his name's Carl.
House : I call him Kevin.
UNK: It's his secret friendship club name.
Chase : It's hookers. Oh, my God!
UNK: Multiple hookers. But House is House. He's gotta have it his way. Four or five women.
UNK: This isn't even funny. What? You don't think he has sex?
UNK: - No, ofcourse he... - He doesn't have sex, he makes love.
Cameron : I didn't say that.
Foreman : It's the lab.
Foreman : Dr. Foreman.
UNK: Respiratory Therapy, call 4702.
UNK: Respiratory Therapy, pick up 4702.
Lola : If you have the results, I'd like you to talk to both of us. If you don't, I'm late for a meeting.
House : Believe me. I'd much rather be with your better half.
UNK: And by better half, I mean the one who struck out Sammy Sosa on three pitches...
House : and talks a lot less.
House : But I thought I would talk to you first and alone.
House : I got your results back from the lab.
House : You do match.
House : I... I do?
House : You're also pregnant.
House : You can't be a donor.
House : Not in your current condition.
UNK: Um... excuse me.
Lola : I have to go talk to my husband.
Foreman : Heart looks good. We can schedule the transplant.
Hank : No transplant.
Hank : Lola's not gonna have an abortion.
Foreman : Actually, your wife just told me that she was making an appointment.
Hank : I don't care what she said.
Foreman : I think you two need to discuss this further.
Hank : We've been trying to get pregnant almost since we met.
Foreman : Well, it's your wife's decision whether or not...
Hank : She wants to trade a child for a kidney. That's murder.
Hank : I'm not gonna let her do that.
Cameron : Foreman says we've got a problem about the transplant.
House : If she terminates the pregnancy, he's not gonna let himself die on principle.
Cameron : Would you give up a baby for someone you love?
House : Please tell me I don't have to decide.
UNK: It depends. How long would they live?
UNK: This is a pragmatic question for you?
House : Fifty years, no problem.
UNK: Six months, I say let him die.
UNK: I've actually given this a lot of thought. My personal tipping point is seven years, eight months and 14 days.
Cameron : I couldn't do it.
House : You found religion?
Cameron : Do you have to be religious to believe a fetus is a life? - There seems to be a correlation.
Lola : I'm, uh...
House : Do you like monster trucks?
Cameron : - I don't know what they are. - Right.
House : I got two tickets. Friday night.
Cameron : - You asking me to go with you? - Sure. Sounds good.
Chase : Like a date?
UNK: Exactly.
UNK: Except for the... the date part.
House : Forget it.
UNK: Uh, no, I... I was gonna go to the oncology dinner.
UNK: Ofcourse. You have to hear Wilson's lecture.
Cameron : No. I just found out he canceled, like, two weeks ago.
