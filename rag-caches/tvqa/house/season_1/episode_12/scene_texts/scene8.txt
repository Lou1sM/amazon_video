UNK: So... what do I wear?
Chase : Still with us, Hank? Yeah. I'm here.
Hank : My chest feels funny.
UNK: Tachycardia. Your heart's beating too fast.
UNK: We're sorting it out. But you stay with us, all right?
UNK: - Keep talking to us, Hank! - Where's Lola?
UNK: Ten units of insulin sub-Q, an I.V. push D-50.
Foreman : - Why's his potassium up? - Damned if I know.
UNK: Kayexalate too. We gotta suck that potassium out of him. We gotta get his heart rate down.
UNK: - We need a crash cart! - You got it.
Foreman : - It's definitely not Addison's. - It's not steroids either.
UNK: Set. Help in here, please!
Cameron : His heart rate is 130 and rising like a Randy Johnson line drives.
UNK: "A" for effort. There's no point in doing the transplant.
Cameron : Even if he was stable enough, it's obvious that we have no idea what's wrong with him.
Chase : First it's too high. Now it's too low?
Foreman : His heart's not responding to the atropine.
Cameron : Heart rate's down to 40. I thought it was up.
Cameron : Now it's down. Last time he went out at 35.
House : - What's wrong? - I have no idea.
House : Hit him with the atropine before he gets to 35 again.
Foreman : We've already given him three milliliters.
House : Apparently that's not enough.
Chase : We can't stabilize his heart rate.
House : What did you do to him? Kayexalate.
Foreman : His pulse was through the roof. So was his potassium.
Chase : - It wouldn't do this. - Something did.
House : Call me when he's stable. Or dead.
Warner : I remember the first time.
