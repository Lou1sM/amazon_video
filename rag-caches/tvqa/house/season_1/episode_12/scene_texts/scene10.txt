Wilson : We're having dinner.
UNK: Just catching up.
House : I definitely had pants here.
House : Wait a second. Is that Stacy the stripper?
House : I heard she's playing Atlantic City.
Wilson : No, Stacy the constitutional lawyer.
House : You thought I couldn't handle this news.
House : You talk to her a lot?
Wilson : No, it's been a long time.
Wilson : - If you don't want me to see her... - What is this, eighth grade? I'm fine.
Wilson : It's fine if you're upset.
House : No, it's...
House : I have no right to be upset.
House : You two were friends.
House : You should see her.
House : Say hi for me.
UNK: So, you're okay?
House : I'm not the cancer doctor who's lying about the cancer dinner.
UNK: I'm not the one betraying all those poor little bald-headed dying kids.
House : I'm gonna go get some pants. I stink.
Lola : You're treating him for Addison's and you don't think it's gonna work?
House : He tried to kill himself. I know.
Lola : He's confused. We can have another baby. I can make him understand that.
Lola : I'm having an abortion. We do the transplant... No.
Lola : I can make decisions about my body.
House : And he can make decisions about his. He doesn't want your kidney.
UNK: So he'll die?
UNK: Probably.
House : If you keep that appointment, he'll also probably die.
House : Keep the baby.
House : Are you just being polite?
House : My pants are...
Lola : Oh, they're all wet.
House : You can't smell that?
UNK: You think she'll abort anyway, try to force his hand?
Chase : No, she's not gonna risk losing him.
Cameron : That's funny?
Chase : No, the monster trucks. House asking you, that's... that's funny.
