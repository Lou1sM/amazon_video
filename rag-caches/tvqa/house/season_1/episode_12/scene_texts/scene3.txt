Lola : Trust is a big issue in early recovery. He really did gain the weight honestly.
Chase : If you say so.
UNK: You're not gettin' it.
Hank : He thinks I'm an idiot.
Chase : He sure does.
UNK: Should we save a sample?
UNK: Dr. Sports Fan can put it in Lucite and hang it around his neck.
Foreman : Hey, Friday night, can you cover for me?
Cameron : I think so.
Cameron : Oh, Friday. No, I'm sorry. I have to go to that oncology thing, the seminar.
UNK: Oh. What's goin' on?
UNK: Dinner with the drug rep.
UNK: Castine Pharmaceuticals.
Cameron : Arnie? Claims he has 500 lawyer jokes, only tells one?
UNK: Uh... new guy.
House : You need cash?
House : No, I... I don't have that much on me.
House : No, no, it's not a problem.
UNK: I'll be over by 6 : 00. Okay.
UNK: 5 : 00 p.m. Dr. House checks out.
UNK: It's 4 : 45. I was rounding up.
UNK: Carol Moffatt. Please see Dr. House in Exam One.
UNK: - Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Cathy. - It's Carol.
UNK: Uh... Uh, trouble with the leg?
House : - When's the wedding? - This Saturday.
UNK: Ooh. Not much time to fit into that pretty dress. And no time for practical shoe shopping.
House : You're running two miles a day further than you should be. - It hurts right here...
UNK: New shoes, less miles, and ix-nay on the afternoon Cokes. You're gonna look beautiful.
House : - What's wrong with you? - I can't get my contact lenses out.
House : Out of what? They're not in your eyes.
UNK: But they're red. - That's because you're trying to remove your corneas.
House : What's wrong with you? Uh, lately, my wife has noticed that...
House : Yeah, yeah. Symptoms. We're working on a personal best here.
UNK: U-Uh, numbness in my feet and hands, uh, constipation...
UNK: And? Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable talking about his private matters.
House : Well, neither would I if I was having trouble controlling my pee-pee.
House : You're a dentist. Nitrous oxide poisoning.
House : Which means you're either dipping into your own supply or you got a bad valve in your office.
House : Laughing gas rehab's probably more expensive than the plumber.
House : Meanwhile, get yourself some B-12.
House : Who's left? I can't see.
UNK: No, I'm just screwin' with you. It's a hangover.
Student : My English lit prof told me he'd fail me next time if I didn't show up with a doctor's note.
UNK: Well, make friends with the dentist. He can give you a note, and maybe a little nitrous to take the edge off.
House : Dr. House.
Cameron : He tested negative for steroids.
UNK: Elevated beta-2 proteins though.
Foreman : Could be cancerous... Amyloidosis or lymphoma.
Cameron : Or steroids. You guys got any money on you?
Cameron : He tested negative for steroids.
Cameron : I have a couple 20s on me. Fifty of'em?
UNK: Foreman? The fat-pad biopsy and abdominal C.T. scan were negative for the cancers, but...
House : That just leaves us with steroids.
Cameron : He tested negative for steroids.
House : Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer...
House : than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use.
UNK: But there is one thing they can't hide.
House : Hi. I'm Dr. House.
