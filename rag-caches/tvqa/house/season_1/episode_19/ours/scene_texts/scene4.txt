Wilson : - No fever, no neck pain. She's fine. - Smell her hair. No chlorine.
House : Which means she wasn't at the pool, which means she's come to a quarantined area...
UNK: because she's an idiot or she's insane.
House : No one is that stupid. East wing, psych ward. Bye-bye.
Chase : Neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer.
UNK: You up to the B's? Well done.
UNK: That would account for all her meningeal symptoms... rash, fever.
Wilson : You're fine. Take these two pills.
House : Get a sample of her bone marrow.
Foreman : From here? Break time.
UNK: - I need more than 15 minutes. - Use Chase's break too.
UNK: Go.
UNK: You should just fire Chase. What, and miss out on all this fun?
UNK: So you're gonna torture him for a while and then fire him?
Wilson : That's cold. You don't think he has it coming?
Wilson : Hey, I said fire him. That's cold.
House : All he did was save his job. What?
Wilson : He completely screwed you over.
House : Right rudder.
House : Bank, bank, bank.
UNK: Good coffee? The rest of this hospital is busting its tail and you're...
UNK: What are you doing? - Trying to think of anything except the produce department at Whole Foods.
Cuddy : I am working. It got hot. Stop acting like a 13-year-old. Sorry.
House : You just don't usually see breasts like that on deans of medicine.
Cuddy : Oh, women can't be heads of hospitals? Or just ugly ones?
UNK: No, they can be babes. It's just you don't usually see their fun bags.
UNK: Your 3 : 00 interview for Dr. Cameron's position is in your office.
House : Not interviewing today. I don't know if you've heard, but there's this big-time epidemic.
House : Many sick people. Puking in the hallways. It's crazy. We can reschedule.
House : No, you won't. You will interview this person.
Cuddy : And if he can put two sentences together, you will send him to the lobby...
Cuddy : where he will do his job.
Cuddy : Unlike the two of you.
Foreman : Come on. You know I can't do a bone marrow aspiration in the hallway.
Brenda : And I can't give you a procedure room.
Foreman : I just need something at least close to a sterile environment.
UNK: I need ten more nurses.
Foreman : Brenda, listen. Listen. She'll die.
Brenda : At least she'll have a bed then. Put that over there.
Mary : Are there dead people in those cabinets?
Foreman : I hope that's who's in there.
Foreman : Just be calm. Relax.
UNK: Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Foreman : Hang on.
Foreman : Hang on.
UNK: Dr. Spain : You know, I really admire the way you don't care what anyone thinks. You just do what you want, the way you want.
Wilson : So you went to Hopkins for both undergrad and med school?
House : - That's right. - He's in a band.
UNK: - You're into music? - Totally.
House : What kind of music do you play?
UNK: Dr. Spain : Mostly blues, you know, James Cotton, some original stuff.
House : - Oh, dude, you are so hired. - Really?
House : - Not a chance. - Why?
