House : - I saw the light on. - It's daytime.
House : It's a figure of speech.
House : Always so literal.
Cameron : - Got a new cane. - Yeah.
House : Guy in the store said it was slimming.
House : Vertical stripe.
Cameron : - Why are you here? - Vogler is dead.
Cameron : What? What happened?
House : Again with the literal translation. Vogler, the idea.
House : Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags. "Bow down before me".
House : He is gone from the hospital.
House : So things can go back to the way they were.
House : The way they were was kind of weird.
UNK: Hmm. Weird works for me.
Cameron : What are you saying? Literally.
House : - I want you to come back. - Why?
House : Please unclench.
House : You're not on the clock, and when you do that, I clench and it's a whole thing.
Cameron : Could you look at your pager?
House : It's no big deal. Some sort of epidemic. Not my area.
Cameron : - You should go. It's important. - What I'm doing now is important.
Cameron : - Why do you want me back? - 'Cause you're a good doctor.
Cameron : - That's it? - That's not enough?
Cameron : Not for me.
Cameron : Go deal with your plague.
UNK: Overhead Speaker Voice : You are in a quarantined area.
UNK: Overhead Speaker Voice : Please remain calm and stay in line. A doctor will see you shortly.
UNK: Overhead Speaker Voice : When you see a doctor, you will receive a blue or yellow form.
UNK: Overhead Speaker Voice : Patients with blue forms must immediately exit to the parking lot.
UNK: Dr. House. Need you here.
House : Sorry. Lot of sick people. I might catch something.
Cuddy : A judge at the campus pool center collapsed.
Cuddy : L.P. revealed a virulent form of bacterial meningitis.
UNK: Great. You got it diagnosed. You don't need me.
Cuddy : 2,500 people at the pool center were exposed.
Cuddy : They're being bused to all the neighboring hospitals.
UNK: That's a problem with resources, not diagnostics.
UNK: I... I'd be completely lost, get in everyone's way.
UNK: Joe. Dr. House doesn't have a blue slip.
UNK: No one leaves the quarantine area without a blue slip.
UNK: You are a doctor at this hospital. Act like one.
UNK: And...
Wilson : take these.
UNK: 102.
House : You win a trip to the second floor.
UNK: Next.
Coach : All right. No fever. No rash.
Wilson : You're fine. Take these two pills.
Wilson : And show this blue slip to Security on your way out.
UNK: Next.
House : Take these. Go home.
House : Talk to your daughter. What?
House : Your pants, your blouse, your scarf are all freshly dry cleaned. Everything except your jacket.
House : It's got a smudge on it. Probably two days old.
House : Which means you didn't know the jacket had been worn.
House : So either your husband is a cross-dresser,
UNK: or your daughter's been borrowing your clothes without telling you.
UNK: She probably wants to look older to get into bars.
Patient : I don't have a daughter.
UNK: Next.
UNK: So I have it? Take the yellow form to the second floor.
Chase : You're gonna be fine. I'm gonna die.
Chase : It's treatable... As long as you go to the second floor.
UNK: Next.
UNK: Yow.
UNK: Fever? Does that mean I have it?
UNK: Do you have a rash?
