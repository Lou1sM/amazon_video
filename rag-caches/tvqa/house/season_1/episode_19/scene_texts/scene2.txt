UNK: Okay, I want you to hold your knees and tuck your head.
Mary : - Like a dive? - Exactly.
Foreman : Good. Great. Don't forget to breathe.
Coach : All right.
UNK: Sorry.
Foreman : Geez. Coach, help me out here.
Foreman : Play a little defense before I poke the wrong thing.
Foreman : Okay, here we go.
UNK: - Ow. I feel it. Ow. I feel it. I fee... Ow. - Try to relax, Mary. Try to relax.
UNK: Relax.
House : What letter are you up to? "A".
House : Torture combing through all that stuff, ain't it?
House : - Real dull. Awful. - It's no problem.
House : Well, thank goodness.
House : A lot of people would resent having to do this.
UNK: If you receive a blue form, please exit the area.
UNK: If you receive a yellow form, please proceed to the second floor.
Foreman : Where's the 12-year-old girl that was here?
Nurse : Needed the gurney. She just had a lumbar puncture.
Foreman : She's not supposed to be moved. Sorry. We needed the gurney.
UNK: Hey.
House : - Hey. - You okay? How's your head feeling?
Coach : She's got a headache and she's dizzy.
Foreman : She shouldn't have been moved after the procedure. I'm sorry.
Mary : I'm fine. What did the test show?
UNK: No meningitis and no other infections.
Mary : But you're not carrying a blue form. I have something else, don't I?
Foreman : Something's causing your symptoms. We're gonna keep you here overnight.
UNK: I know it's a little crazy in here, but hopefully it'll settle down...
UNK: and we'll be able to get you a room.
Mary : I'm sorry. I'm not usually all emotional like this. I just...
Coach : You're doing great. Your folks land in a few hours.
Mary : I just... I haven't slept. I'm so tired.
Mary : Oh, my God. My eye's bleeding.
Mary : What is it? What's happening?
Foreman : Oh, don't worry.
Foreman : The antibiotic we gave you in case you had meningitis can turn your tears reddish.
Foreman : That's not blood.
Foreman : But that...
Foreman : That's blood.
Mary : That's going into my stomach?
UNK: The lavage showed blood in your G.I. tract.
Chase : We need to find where it's coming from.
Chase : You won't feel it.
UNK: I'm gonna numb the back of your throat, and Dr. Foreman is gonna give you a sedative. Open.
House : - Ugh. - Swallow.
Chase : Now lay on your side for me.
Chase : And... here we go.
