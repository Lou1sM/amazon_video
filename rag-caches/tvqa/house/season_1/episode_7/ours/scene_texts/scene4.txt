House : - I.V. immunoglobulin. - So we're just gonna ignore the tumor?
UNK: Well, eventually it'll get bigger. Then it'll be really easy to find.
House : One of you needs to check out where she works. - Why?
House : 'Cause the husband's not sick. Meaning?
Wilson : If it's not paraneoplastic, and it is a reaction to some sort of toxin,
Wilson : it's obviously not coming from their home.
House : Foreman, you do it.
Foreman : Why are you riding me? It's what I do.
UNK: Has it got worse lately? Yeah. Seems to me.
UNK: Really?
House : Well, that rules out the race thing. 'Cause you were just as black last week.
UNK: How long has Elyse worked here?
UNK: Oh, three years. She's my best rÃÂtisseur.
UNK: And what's that? The rÃÂtisseur prepares the roasted meats and gravies.
Foreman : How do you clean your grill?
UNK: You say "elbow grease". Do you use chemical cleaners?
UNK: Ah, non. Absolument. And chefs don't do the cleaning anyway.
Foreman : What about pesticides? You must spray for roaches and that sort of thing.
UNK: No. My kitchen is clean. No roaches.
Jacques : I need to get back to work.
UNK: So the fact that I'm here asking you these questions, it doesn't worry you?
Jacques : Look at me. I'm here 18 hours a day.
Jacques : That guy practically lives here. He does live here.
Jacques : I use the same detergents for 15 years, and everyone is healthy as a horse.
UNK: Whatever Elyse has, she didn't get here.
Jacques : Tell her I hope she feels better.
UNK: And I had to get a new rÃÂtisseur.
UNK: Where's Ed? - He went down to the gift shop to buy a shirt.
Cameron : I told him I'd stay up here in case you woke up.
Elise : You must have better things to do.
Cameron : I send my laundry out.
Elise : - You're not married? - No.
Elise : Waiting for the perfect guy?
Cameron : Let me guess. You've already found him.
Elise : He threw my towels out the window.
UNK: That's how we met.
UNK: Freshman year, Ed came to a party that my roommate and I threw.
Elise : He spent most of the night on the bathroom floor.
UNK: He figured I wouldn't notice the vomit on the towels if I didn't have any towels.
Cameron : I'm assuming he came back the next day to apologize?
Elise : No way. I had to track him down.
Elise : Conflict resolution has never been one of Ed's strong points.
Elise : Nobody's perfect, right?
Ed : I guess.
Elise : Oh, my neck hurts.
Cameron : You've been in this bed for a really long time.
Cameron : We're gonna do the same test we did last night, okay? Do you know what day it is?
UNK: My arm itches. It's probably a mild skin irritation. I'll get you some hydrocortisone in a minute.
Cameron : - Do you know what day it is? - Tuesday.
Elise : It really itches.
UNK: How about I get you that cream right now?
Elise : Oh, my God! Get them off! Get 'em off of me!
UNK: - Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! - Elyse, calm down.
UNK: - Get them off me! - Elyse, calm down. Calm down.
UNK: They're biting me! Oh! They're biting me!
UNK: I'm gonna need some Haldol, five milligrams.
UNK: - Honey, what's wrong? - Get 'em off!
UNK: Get 'em off. Get 'em off. There's nothing there, Elyse.
UNK: They're biting me. There's nothing there.
UNK: Ow!
Foreman : We had to sedate her.
House : You gave sedatives to a patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?
Foreman : It was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms.
UNK: Where's Wilson? - Creepy-crawlies are consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome.
