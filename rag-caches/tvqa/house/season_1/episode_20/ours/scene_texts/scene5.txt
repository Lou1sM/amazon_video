Harvey : All this is because of the strangulation?
Chase : More like strangulations.
Harvey : My parents are right.
Harvey : I'm a loser.
UNK: I don't... I don't know what...
UNK: - I don't know what to do. I need to... - Harvey, calm down.
Harvey : - I need to talk to Annette. - You can do this on your own.
Chase : Surgery's the only... She hates me.
Harvey : I've been calling. I've been calling and she...
Harvey : She's not picking up.
Chase : - Harvey, you don't need... - I can't. I can't.
Chase : Harvey, you will do what I say.
Harvey : I don't want surgery.
Chase : - Sign the consent. Sign it! - I can't do anything.
Harvey : No surgery. No surgery!
Harvey : No surgery!
Cameron : We could give him antidepressants. See if he changes his mind.
Chase : I already did. Mashed 'em up in his apple sauce.
Chase : It'll lighten him up soon enough. Someone should just tell him to do it.
House : Way faster. So's forgery... also illegal.
Chase : And I already tried. Not you.
House : Where's a good dominatrix when you need one?
Chase : Annette's barred from the hospital.
House : If you get caught, Cuddy's got a hairbrush,
House : and believe me, she knows how to use it.
Harvey : They let you come back.
Annette : Not because you deserve it.
Annette : You've been bad.
Annette : You will have the surgery. Do you understand?
UNK: No.
Annette : Do not laugh at me.
UNK: You will respect me. - Where do you get off telling me what to do?
UNK: Get out of my room, you bag-faced witch.
UNK: Is this a part of their deal?
Annette : This isn't like him.
Annette : - Something's wrong. - Get out!
UNK: Get out! Get out! Get out!
UNK: Get out! - Emotional swings... he's having another stroke.
UNK: Harvey!
Chase : He's crashing. Can we get a cart in here?
Lawyer : So what's that? Two strokes you've scared this guy into?
House : Yeah. It's making me question my view of myself as a people person.
Lawyer : Now you want to do surgery on him without his consent?
Cuddy : The kid's in a coma. He needs the surgery.
Lawyer : He said no. We can't do it.
House : Emergent situation. We invoke heroic measures.
UNK: You need a court order. Great. Where do I get me one of them?
UNK: Do I need to lawyer up? - I'll need to show the judge an affidavit from next of kin.
House : They might have a problem signing anything, seeing as how they're dead.
UNK: He'll want proof. - Like what, Dad's hand? I don't even know where they're buried.
UNK: Bring me a published obit, or death certificate, and we'll run with it.
Lawyer : I don't want you to mess up your clothes.
Cameron : His parents were accountants.
Cameron : Maybe there's an obit in the trade papers. Guy lives in Market Town.
UNK: I don't know if he grew up there, but we could check the local funeral homes.
House : Great, and when your searches turn up nothing,
UNK: you should try and find where they live. He said they were dead.
