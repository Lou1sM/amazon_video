UNK: Well, good to see you've got the correct perspective on the thing.
UNK: Well, the old ones, I mean, made me feel like a tree, you know?
House : Nice visual.
UNK: But the new ones, I might as well be eating candy.
House : Candy wouldn't take away your headaches. What?
House : You came to me and told me you were having too much sex.
Ramona : I never did. You too, sequoia.
Myron : - Well, no, that's not true. I... - I know everybody lies,
House : but you'd think that after a certain amount of time together, you wouldn't be trying so hard.
House : - Your rings don't match. - Why would they?
UNK: The style is one thing, but one silver, one gold? How long have you guys been married?
UNK: Fifty-five years. Forty-nine years.
House : Damn it. You're having an affair.
Ramona : Did you really say you wanted to have less sex?
Myron : Well, less. If I wanted none, I'd stay home with Esther.
Ramona : I just need a little rest.
UNK: You guys aren't the victims of the little blue pills, you're the problem.
Harvey : - I'm sorry. - Me too.
Ramona : I should just have told you how I felt.
UNK: Aw.
House : Oh, welcome to hell.
