UNK: Accountants are usually pretty good with money,
House : so how come he lives in a slum like Market Town?
Cameron : Maybe they were bad accountants.
House : Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim?
UNK: The odds are astronomical. Maybe Harvey burned through their money.
Chase : Or maybe they cut him off when they found out about his proclivities.
UNK: Gotta be my bet. Go to his apartment. See if you can find his folks.
UNK: Number, address, something.
Foreman : Hey. Can I talk to you?
UNK: Sure.
Foreman : Look. Cameron's a friend.
Foreman : - This whole dating... - Time's up. Thanks for playing.
Foreman : Hey, I've been on the scene more than you recently. Way ahead of you.
UNK: I got a case of malt liquor stashed in the trunk.
House : Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD.
House : We are gonna get all the way down. Now move.
Foreman : Come on. You're not into her.
Foreman : Most guys who aren't interested in a woman try to sugar coat it, be nice.
House : - Oh, you know me too well. - That's what I'm saying.
Foreman : I think you should go with your instincts here. Be a jerk.
House : I'm missing my soap for this?
Foreman : Women love to be right.
UNK: You gotta leave 'em feeling superior, like they dodged a bullet.
UNK: But if you're nice, she'll blame herself...
House : And fall for me even more.
House : The love doctor has made an art out of breaking up with women...
House : 'cause you're convinced that the loss of you would be too devastating for any woman to handle.
UNK: Yeah. I'm the one with the serious ego problem here.
UNK: I'm just saying...
UNK: some relationships aren't meant to happen.
Cameron : Harvey's school registration.
Chase : Permanent home address? Emergency contacts?
UNK: "Annette Rains".
Chase : Mistress Annette.
UNK: You had to extort a date out of House.
UNK: You don't think that's a bad sign?
UNK: Cameron?
Cameron : High school yearbook.
Cameron : Think this might give us a clue, Sherlock?
UNK: House isn't gonna hand you anything.
Chase : You want him, you gotta take him.
Chase : Jump him.
Foreman : Harvey... H-A-R-V-E-Y.
Cameron : I'm sorry to have bothered you. Thank you. Okay.
Chase : Yes. Harvey Park.
Chase : Great. We've been looking for you.
Chase : I'm calling from the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.
Chase : Harvey's here, and it's rather...
Chase : - He hung up. - You tell him why you were calling?
Chase : I didn't get a chance. Call back.
House : I'll do it.
House : Let the master show you how it's done.
House : Mr. Park? This is Dr. House calling...
UNK: from Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.
House : Your son Harvey is dead. We need you to identify the body.
House : Yes. I'm sorry. It's the law.
UNK: Okay.
House : There's a real art to delivering bad news.
UNK: They're gonna show up at the morgue. - Be sure and let me know when Cuddy starts screaming.
Cuddy : You lied to them! He told us our son was dead.
House : It's only a white lie.
House : Technically, all I did was call them a little early.
