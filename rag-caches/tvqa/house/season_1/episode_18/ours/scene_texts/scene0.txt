Foreman : The good news is it doesn't look like a stroke.
Foreman : No bleeds, no clots.
UNK: Thank God. It sounds like there's bad news.
Foreman : We got your blood work back. Some things are a little off.
Foreman : Your liver and kidneys aren't working so well.
Sean : Why? What would cause that? It's preeclampsia, isn't it?
UNK: I'm gonna miscarry, aren't I? - Preeclampsia is a possibility. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Naomi : I've miscarried three times. I'm 39.
Naomi : We had to use in vitro. You've gotta make sure the baby's okay.
Sean : Let's make sure that you're okay first.
Foreman : How about we take care of both of you at the same time?
UNK: The nurse will be in soon to take some blood. I'd like to run some more tests.
Naomi : - Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you.
Chase : Where is everybody? No one's in the office?
UNK: No. I haven't heard from Cameron all day. You seen House?
Foreman : Look for a shallow grave with Vogler standing over it.
UNK: You have a stage IV cancer.
House : It's metastasized to your liver.
UNK: There's a new drug called 8C12 that's shown promise in Phase II trials.
House : It's your best shot.
Naomi : Thank you, Doctor.
UNK: You've been so good to me and...
UNK: Well, I... I did...
House : publicly bash your company's drug.
Vogler : When I think about how I treated you...
House : Oh, hey. Come on.
House : There, there, there.
Vogler : So, um, there is some hope.
UNK: Always.
UNK: But just in case, I special-ordered an extra-jumbo-sized coffin.
UNK: Hey.
House : Don't thank me. It's just who I am.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Up and at 'em, big guy.
House : Sorry. Up late. Internet porn.
Chase : How come you're not in your office?
House : Because there is a computer in my office, and if I log on, romance will ensue.
UNK: My wrist might fall off. - Hiding 'cause Vogler's looking for you, huh?
Foreman : That's just pathetic.
House : I don't like loud, angry giants threatening me with violence. How is that pathetic?
Chase : You think you can avoid firing one of us by hiding out here?
Chase : He'll find you sooner or later.
House : I'm okay with later.
Foreman : 39-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant.
UNK: - G, four. P, zero. - Three miscarriages?
UNK: Gimme. Altered mental status and complete loss of coordination.
House : Tox screen? Negative for alcohol and drugs.
Foreman : She was on oxybutynin. For incontinence.
UNK: Yeah. Well, we took her off. No change. B.U.N. and creatinine are up. L.F.T.'s slightly elevated.
Chase : Preeclampsia. Call the OB-GYN service and rub some prayer beads.
UNK: - B.P.'s normal. No preeclampsia in other pregnancies. - Because she didn't carry for long enough.
Foreman : The three miscarriages make me think it's an underlying physiology.
House : Pregnancy-related autoimmunity.
House : Too bad that Cameron quit.
UNK: We could use an immunologist right now.
House : We'll see if you're right. Check the blood. - Cameron quit?
House : Last night.
House : And do an M.R.A. for vasculitis too.
UNK: There's no way she quit.
Foreman : She got fired because you couldn't swallow your pride.
House : An ultrasound? Excellent thought.
House : And put her on magnesium too, in case it is preeclampsia.
UNK: Sure.
Foreman : Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Chase : I didn't do anything. Exactly my point.
Chase : You wanted me to yell at him?
UNK: What would that have achieved? Was he gonna jump into his time machine and fix everything?
Foreman : When a dog dumps on the floor, do you pat its head? No. You smack it in the nose with a newspaper.
