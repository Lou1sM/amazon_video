Vogler : The board's meeting again this evening.
Vogler : Why don't you settle down, play some Game Boy?
Vogler : Why don't you watch your soap?
Vogler : I hear they're firing the handsome doctor today. Boy, that should be a good one.
Sean : If we had the C-section anyway,
UNK: she could still do the experimental treatment, right?
UNK: We'd just have to wait 30 days. - Assuming the doctor running the trial isn't too pissed off to let her in.
Naomi : And assuming I'm even healthy enough to...
UNK: Honey.
UNK: Are you okay? - Sats are dropping... down to the 80s. Stay with us, Naomi.
Sean : What's going on? We need you to leave the room.
Foreman : Respiratory distress.
UNK: - Could you tell me what's going on? - We're trying to find out.
UNK: Here. Still kicking.
Chase : Flash pulmonary edema?
Foreman : Lungs are clear. Here it is.
Chase : - Pulmonary embolus. - Gotta get her to an O.R.
UNK: Now. Right away. Uh, what happened?
Foreman : It's an embolism... a blood clot. Fairly common with lung cancer.
Foreman : It's not a full saddle embolism. So blood's still trickling through. We've been able to get Naomi breathing a little,
Foreman : but we need to remove the clot, and we need you to approve the treatment. Ofcourse.
Sean : Whatever you have to do, just do it. It's not that simple.
Foreman : The best course for the baby would be an immediate C-section. The longer we postpone,
UNK: the greater chance he'll have brain damage from lack of oxygen. Fine. Just do it.
Foreman : Here's the problem.
Foreman : The C-section would be very, very dangerous for Naomi. Dangerous like...
Foreman : In her current condition, there's a real chance she won't survive.
Naomi : I'm sorry.
Foreman : Your wife's unconscious. We need you to make a decision.
Sean : I just want her to live.
Sean : No C-section.
UNK: Sats are still way down. We gotta push the streptokinase.
Chase : Too risky. Even if it dissolves the clot, she could still bleed out...
Foreman : - She's hemodynamically compromised. - It's not good for the baby.
Foreman : Dad doesn't care.
UNK: Bolusing 250,000 units.
Foreman : B.P.'s dropping.
UNK: Pressors. Don't have time. We've gotta suck it out.
Foreman : Systolic B.P.'s 80.
Foreman : B.P.'s stabilizing.
UNK: O2 sats rising.
House : - Did you get the clot? - I think so.
Chase : She's stabilized. How long was her oxygen at that level?
UNK: - About 10 minutes. - Brain function compromised?
UNK: Shouldn't be, but we'll...
Foreman : B.P.'s dropping. Up the dopamine.
Chase : - She's not responding. How much? - Up to 30 micrograms.
Chase : Is she septic?
House : She's bleeding into her abdomen.
Foreman : We won't be able to stop it.
Foreman : I'll go talk to the husband.
