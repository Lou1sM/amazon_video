Chase : Dogs can learn things. House can't.
UNK: Coward. Child.
Foreman : Hey, there.
Foreman : I, uh, brought my colleague along to help out. Hi. I'm Dr. Chase.
UNK: Hi.
Chase : Well, ultrasound looks good. No sign of fetal distress.
Naomi : So it's not preeclampsia?
Chase : Well, it still could be, but it hasn't progressed at least.
Chase : We're gonna put you on bed rest and monitor the baby.
UNK: Okay. We'll give you some potassium and magnesium as well.
Chase : We should keep the fluids running...
Chase : and check her again in an hour unless there are signs of fetal distress. Honey?
Sean : She's choking!
Foreman : Lean forward.
Sean : - Is she all right? - Probably just some muscle weakness.
UNK: - What do you mean "probably"? - Naomi, open up.
Chase : People choke. It could be nothing.
Sean : You all right?
Naomi : I can't... I can't... I can't even swallow.
Joel : She gets sick a lot.
UNK: Like this... this cold got really bad all of a sudden.
Joel : And the fever...
UNK: Shh. It's okay.
UNK: It's not a cold. It's pneumonia.
UNK: Pneumonia? - Relax. Pneumonia's her second biggest problem.
UNK: She has gone from the 25th weight percentile to the third in one month.
House : I'm not a baby expert, but I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to shrink.
Rachel : Well, there's this diet we put her on when she stopped breast-feeding.
Joel : But it's healthy. Um, raw food. We're vegans.
Joel : Almond milk, tofu, uh, vegetables.
Joel : Raw food.
UNK: If only her ancestors had mastered the secret of fire.
UNK: Babies need fat, proteins, calories. Less important, sprouts and hemp.
UNK: Starving babies is bad... And illegal in many cultures.
UNK: - I'm having her admitted. - Is she gonna be all right?
House : Antibiotics for the pneumonia, I.V. feeding to get the weight up.
House : Don't worry. It's a vegan I.V.
Chase : Don't see any signs of vasculitis.
UNK: Odd.
Chase : Since you're always right about everything.
Foreman : Could be a different autoimmunity.
Foreman : Or you could bite me.
Naomi : Oh, no.
Chase : - Naomi, you okay? - No. I can't... I'm getting cramps.
UNK: Strong? Oh. Yeah. Feels like my miscarriage.
UNK: Stop. Preterm labor.
Naomi : He's too little. He won't survive.
Foreman : She's on magnesium already. Fluids and terbutaline then.
UNK: We're gonna give you some medicine, okay? Try to stop your labor. - Okay.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Oh! Ah.
House : There you are. Been looking everywhere for you.
