Foreman : Nothing on the adrenals.
Foreman : Heard Cameron went home. Is she sick?
Chase : Go back to the pituitary views.
UNK: She seemed okay. - Think she's got another reason for leaving?
Chase : I hope so. Wait, stop.
UNK: There. What's that?
UNK: Huh. A tumor.
House : It's Cushing's.
UNK: The tumor causes Cushing's. Cushing's messes with hormone production.
UNK: Hormones control everything : growth, weight...
UNK: Can you fix it? She'll need surgery to remove the tumor.
Foreman : Once it's gone, everything will get normal very fast.
Mom : - No mastectomy? - No.
House : Thank God. The surgery is dangerous.
UNK: The pituitary's located between the cavernous sinuses,
Foreman : basically right between the eyes.
Foreman : The area contains the nerves that control eye movement and the major arteries that feed the brain.
UNK: Mr. Conroy : Oh, my God.
UNK: The surgeon will approach the gland transsphenoidally.
Foreman : An incision will be made under the lip,
UNK: through which he'll insert a fiber-optic microscope.
Foreman : Once the tumor's found, he'll cut it into small pieces and remove it through the same hole under the lip.
Foreman : The whole procedure should take about three hours, and your daughter should be able to go home in a few days.
Foreman : The sores will go away, as well as her fatigue and the muscle pain.
Foreman : She'll even start losing weight.
UNK: Jessica. Hi.
Cameron : - Is that really you? - Yep, it's me.
Chase : You look fantastic.
Mom : - She always looked fantastic. - Yeah.
Cuddy : - It's been a week. - Actually, it's over a week.
UNK: How have you guys been?
Cuddy : Who is it?
UNK: Chase.
Vogler : No, Chase stays. Pick someone else.
House : The deal was... The deal's changed.
Vogler : - Pick someone else. - No.
UNK: Mmm.
Vogler : Pick someone else, or it'll be the whole department.
