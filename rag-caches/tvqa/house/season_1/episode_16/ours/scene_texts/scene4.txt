House : I am not miserable. You're not happy.
Foreman : And you are? With my job, yes.
UNK: I am exactly where I wanna be, doing exactly what I wanna do.
Wilson : Think I sense a hint of sarcasm there.
Wilson : Why don't you pick yourself? Quit? Hmm, I was wrong.
Wilson : About Vogler or Foreman? Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy test.
UNK: Who's Mrs. Hernandez? Either a woman carrying an alien baby or your newest patient.
Foreman : So you never saw her with any pills. She never mentioned anything?
UNK: No, ofcourse not.
Foreman : Would it be all right if I, uh, talk to a couple of her friends?
Foreman : Her friends? I'm not gonna interrogate them.
UNK: I just wanna ask if Jessica ever mentioned anything.
UNK: It's... It's pretty important. She's very sick.
UNK: Ms. Ayers : I understand. It's just, well...
UNK: Ms. Ayers : Jessica really doesn't have any friends.
Wilson : Not one? I've tried to help,
UNK: Ms. Ayers : make the kids include her more, but... kids can be...
UNK: Mr. Conroy : - Kids? - I was gonna say jerks.
UNK: Ms. Ayers : All the fifth-graders are assigned an eighth-grade buddy.
UNK: Ms. Ayers : Maybe you could talk to hers.
Vogler : What's the status on House?
Cuddy : He asked for time to complete performance reviews for everyone in his department.
Vogler : And you told him no and gave him how long?
Cuddy : A week. He'll do it.
Vogler : Guy's never done what he's told. I don't see why he's gonna start now.
Vogler : Hi. Edward Vogler.
Vogler : Is Dr. House claiming that I'm forcing him to get rid of one of you?
Vogler : I assume his goal is to stir up antagonism toward me.
Cameron : - And your goal is? - I am forcing him.
Vogler : I'll do whatever I can to ease the transition for whoever he chooses.
Cameron : If you're feeling guilty about your decision, there is an easy solution. - I don't feel guilty.
Cameron : Then... why approach me and tell me all this?
Vogler : I don't feel guilty. That doesn't mean I don't feel bad.
Vogler : I'm rich, but I'm still human.
Vogler : I just wanted you to know...
Vogler : that if there's anything I can do for you, my door's open.
Cameron : Thank you.
UNK: You're lookin' for info? Thought you already had House all figured out.
Vogler : I do. Don't know his team though.
Wilson : The ultrasound and biopsy confirmed our worry.
Wilson : The tumor is extremely large, at least 30 pounds.
UNK: Oh, God. It's actually a personal record for this clinic.
Wilson : But it's completely benign. There's no sign of cancer at all.
Wilson : I've already spoken with Dr. Bergin, and he's available first thing in the morning.
Lucille : For what?
Wilson : For the surgery.
Lucille : But if it's not cancer, it can't kill me, right?
UNK: Mmm, no. I'll have a huge scar.
Lucille : I won't be able to wear a bikini.
House : - You wear a bikini now? - Yeah. You got a problem with that?
House : Nope. But I've never gone swimming with you.
Lucille : I knew it. That's what this is all about.
Lucille : You are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery.
House : Yeah, that's exactly why I planted a 30-pound tumor on your ovary.
UNK: It's not gonna kill me. The only thing surgery is gonna do is change the way I look.
Lucille : That is the definition of cosmetic surgery.
Wilson : Uh, it would also relieve your heartburn and discomfort.
Lucille : Yeah, right. Why give an antacid if you can cut someone up...
Lucille : and make them a little easier on your eyes?
Lucille : My husband... loves my body. He can't get enough of it.
UNK: You think he's gonna wanna touch me if I look like I've been gutted like a fish?
Wilson : That was unexpected.
House : Yeah, it was.
Clementine : All she does during recess is run laps around the playground.
Clementine : She says she's exercising, but everyone knows it's just because no one wants to play with her.
Clementine : I mean, I'm only her buddy because Ms. Ayers assigned her to me.
Clementine : That does not mean I am her friend.
Foreman : I'll make sure her doctors are all clear on that.
UNK: Thanks.
Foreman : So, has she ever said anything to you about diet pills?
UNK: - Ha. She told you that too? - What do you mean?
Clementine : I totally busted her for taking drugs one day.
UNK: She totally lied, said that they were diet pills her mom had given her.
Clementine : Come on. Get real. No way a girl like that is taking diet pills.
Mom : I didn't give her diet pills. I would never do that.
Foreman : Right. So it was her imaginary mom.
Mom : She didn't take any pills. The girl's lying.
Foreman : Why would she lie? Because she's another mean little jerk.
Foreman : - Mom. - I'm sorry, honey.
Jessica : Clemmie didn't lie.
Jessica : I did. I took the pills.
Jessica : I told her you gave them to me because I didn't wanna get in trouble.
Foreman : Where did you get them? I took them from the store.
Mom : Why? Why would you do that?
Jessica : Because I didn't wanna be ugly anymore.
Mom : - Oh, baby. You're not ugly. - Yes, I am.
Jessica : I know you don't think so, but I am. I'm disgusting.
Mom : Jessica, please don't say that.
UNK: I just... I just wanted to fit in.
Jessica : You know, have friends?
Jessica : Or at least have one person my age be nice to me.
UNK: Oh.
Foreman : Listen, the, uh...
