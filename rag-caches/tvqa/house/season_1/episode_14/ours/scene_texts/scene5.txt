House : Mr. Van Der Meer.
UNK: What?
UNK: Relax. Ricky's gonna be just "finkf". Strep throat.
House : Here's a prescription for an antibiotic. He should be all better in a few days.
UNK: Although, this might sting a little.
UNK: I wanna see you again real soon.
Wilson : Virtual colonoscopy was clean.
Wilson : No colon cancer.
UNK: What happened to our regular, old-fashioned colonoscopy?
Wilson : She was uncomfortable doing any more tests. I had to convince her to do that one.
House : Do you get that often? Women would rather die than get naked with you?
Wilson : She's scared.
House : But not of tests. Just embarrassing ones.
UNK: Yeah.
House : It's not an inflammatory process. It's not a clot, because Chase's angio says so.
House : And it's not cancer, because her tush is perfect.
UNK: Anybody else got an Aunt Elyssa with weird stuff?
Cameron : Maybe it's worth looking into...
House : I thought you said Carly's angio was clean.
Chase : It was clean.
House : You guys see the problem here?
Foreman : There's no indication of any abnormalities.
Foreman : No lesions, no spurs, no mastis...
House : Her toes are screwed up. They're backwards.
House : You guys know how much surgery it's gonna take to swap 'em back?
Chase : What are you talking about?
UNK: Well, either she literally has two left feet, or you angioed the wrong leg.
Chase : That's impossible. It can't be... Or maybe it was Jenny.
House : How come some resident signed this radiology report? Were you even in the room?
Chase : - I'll redo her angio... - You'll do nothing!
House : Foreman, you do the angiogram.
Chase : I can't believe I did that.
Carly : Why do we have to redo the angiogram?
Foreman : There was a shadow on the first test result. Shadow?
Carly : A shadow means there could be a blood clot, right?
Carly : I read Conn's Current Therapy.
UNK: A real page-turner. No, it wasn't that kind of shadow.
