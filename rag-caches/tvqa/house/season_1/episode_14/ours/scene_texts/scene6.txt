Carly : My chest hurts. It's from the tracer I injected.
UNK: You might also get a little nauseous or have a metallic taste. All normal.
Carly : I'm a runner. I shouldn't feel like this.
Foreman : Carly, I'm looking at your vitals right now and...
Carly : I can't breathe. Carly?
Carly : My chest.
Carly : My chest.
Foreman : Respiratory arrest. Call code.
UNK: - What do you got? - She's drowning.
Cameron : Foreman did a thoracentesis to drain the fluid from her lungs.
UNK: She's stable. They sent the fluid to the lab. It'll be back in a few hours.
UNK: You'll be happy to know Chase's mistake didn't cost her. Angio revealed no clot.
House : I'm thrilled.
Wilson : Okay, see, now you're just being stubborn.
UNK: It's cold. It's a perfectly good excuse to wear your lab coat.
House : Carly needs a heart transplant.
Wilson : Thoracentesis revealed a transudate?
UNK: I haven't gotten it back yet.
Wilson : Her MUGA scan, what was the ejection fraction?
Wilson : Maybe you could treat it surgically. I haven't done the MUGA.
Wilson : How do you know she needs a heart transplant?
House : I got my aura read today.
House : It said someone close to me had a broken heart.
Wilson : Since when do I need the secret pass code to talk to you?
House : I can't tell you anything. Professional responsibility.
Wilson : Like that matters to you.
House : Not my professional responsibility, yours.
House : New regime. You gotta keep your head down too.
Wilson : Now that's good thinking, because I was gonna go right to Cuddy...
Wilson : and rat you out as soon as you were done talking.
House : I'm not saying you want to. I'm saying you'd be obligated to.
Wilson : Because of my position on the board?
Wilson : Because of my position on the transplant committee?
Wilson : Hey, you brought this up for a reason. You need to talk to me.
Carly : I can't.
