Carly : Why did you fight for me?
Carly : You risked so much, and you hardly know me.
House : You're my patient.
House : Don't screw it up.
House : Love this part!
House : Okay. He ruined it.
Vogler : Just wanted to stop by and introduce myself. I'm Edward Vogler, new chairman of the board.
Vogler : In a way, I guess that makes me your boss.
House : I am sorry about the lab coat thing. My dry cleaners just destroyed it.
Vogler : That was my very first heart transplant committee meeting. Very exciting.
House : Trust me, Six Flags... way more exciting.
UNK: Your patient's very lucky to have such a passionate doctor. Stands up for what he believes in.
House : Sweet of you to say.
UNK: Yeah. Afraid you've been duped though.
Vogler : The nurse found this in the patient's purse.
House : Oh, my. If only I'd known.
Vogler : Tough being a doctor, having all that power.
Vogler : The power to play God.
House : Yes. I don't envy the transplant committee their responsibility.
House : They basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl.
House : I'm not sure I could have done that.
Vogler : This is not a game to me, Dr. House.
UNK: No. It's actually more like we're dancing right now.
House : So let's get to the point. You don't like me.
UNK: I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna like you. It's nothing personal.
House : I don't like anybody.
House : But none of that really matters, does it?
House : Because you've got money, and I've got tenure.
House : You need full board approval to get rid of me. I've got Cuddy.
UNK: Right. And Wilson.
House : So, as long as we're stuck with each other,
House : we might as well ignore each other.
House : That wasn't nearly as dramatic as I was hoping.
Vogler : I looked into that tenure thing, and you're right.
Vogler : It's actually easier for me to get rid of a board member like Cuddy or Wilson...
Vogler : than to get rid of a doctor.
Vogler : That's interesting, isn't it?
