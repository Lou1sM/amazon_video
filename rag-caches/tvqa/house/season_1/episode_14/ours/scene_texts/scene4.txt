UNK: Next time, skip Aunt Elyssa.
Wilson : You're probably talking about a primary bone cancer.
UNK: It could be tricky to detect. We'll need a bone scan.
House : That's why I'm talking to an oncologist.
Wilson : Sure. I've nothing better to do besides departmental meetings and budget reports.
Wilson : New chairman of the board, you know. Oh, I hadn't heard.
Wilson : Right. Clinical trials. Completely unethical.
Wilson : And a very bad omen for you. There's not much money in curing African sleeping sickness.
UNK: No. I have seen every scary movie ever made.
UNK: Six-year-old twins in front of an elevator of blood.
UNK: Boys' choirs. Those are bad omens.
UNK: This is much more mundane. A billionaire wants to get laid.
Wilson : Billionaires buy movie studios to get laid.
Wilson : They buy hospitals to get respect.
House : And the reason you want respect? To get laid.
House : Okay then. Just gotta think like a billionaire.
UNK: Let's see. There'll be big, scary changes and then,
House : "Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner to discuss your future on my G5 private jet."
Wilson : Come on. You know how good you have it here.
House : Yes, I'm the big poobah, the big cheese, the go-to guy.
UNK: You do the cases you wanna do when you wanna do them.
UNK: You're not gonna have that anywhere else. Relax.
House : I've been through three regime changes in this hospital. Every time same story.
Wilson : Just keep your head down. That's all I'm saying.
Wilson : And put on your coat. It itches.
UNK: So, you gonna do this bone scan for me, or what?
UNK: Yes.
House : Dr. Simpson, did you hear? New management.
UNK: I'm thinking of switching to orthopedics.
UNK: How much do you guys get for a massage now? Without the happy ending.
UNK: Dr. House, what do you want? Do you remember a guy named Van Der Meer?
House : Not a big talker. You fixed his A.C.L.
UNK: No, not according to my medical malpractice premiums.
UNK: Didn't get hypotensive during surgery?
House : No strokes? Maybe some connectivity loss?
UNK: What, you're gonna get involved now? I'm not involved.
UNK: A guy brought his son into the clinic. I didn't touch the son.
Simpson : I'm not taking any responsibility there. The son's fine. Can't shut him up.
UNK: Dad show any symptoms of cortical disease? Wernicke's?
Simpson : No. Nothing.
Simpson : That's why we settled because we couldn't find anything.
Simpson : The guy got over a million dollars. Don't tell me he's complaining.
UNK: He's not saying boo.
Robin : Your father wants to know when you'll be back from your trip.
Carly : E-mail back it's taking longer than I thought.
Carly : He doesn't need to see me like this. What about your brother?
Robin : - No. - Hello. I'm Dr. Wilson. I was...
UNK: - Um, Robin, I'm gonna need a minute. - Oh.
Boardmember : Thank you.
Carly : There are two Dr. Wilsons in this hospital,
Carly : one in ophthalmology and one in cancer.
UNK: My eyes are fine, so I'm guessing you're here to tell me that I have cancer.
UNK: There is no cancer in your bone.
Carly : You're not smiling.
Wilson : There's something called referred pain. You could have cancer in one part of your body...
Wilson : that presents in another.
Wilson : Given your age and your family history, I'm thinking your colon.
UNK: Great.
Carly : I was at Columbia when my mom died. Now there's a blast.
Carly : Cleaning up her vomit, and then running to my econ final.
UNK: Look.
Carly : If I'm a short-timer, give me drugs. I'll go back to work. I'll die there.
UNK: Whoa. There's a very quick test to see if you even have it... a colonoscopy.
Carly : I know how you do that test.
Wilson : If you have colon cancer, we can treat it. It's early.
Carly : That's what they told my mom. She was dead six months later.
Wilson : You're a smart person about to make a very bad decision.
Wilson : You know, cancer treatment's come a long way in 12 years, but if you don't do this now...
UNK: I don't wanna be looked at.
Wilson : There is another way.
Wilson : We could do a virtual colonoscopy.
UNK: Basically, we do a C. T. scan of your colon. It's noninvasive.
Wilson : But it's very expensive. I'm assuming that's not a problem.
Wilson : Say yes.
UNK: Dr. Becker...
