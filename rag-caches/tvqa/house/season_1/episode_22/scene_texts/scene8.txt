Stacy : He doesn't want the trigger.
Stacy : He wants to wait, see if we can come up with another explanation.
UNK: If it is A.I.P., how much time does he have?
House : No idea. Next attack could be fatal.
House : Could be six months from now. Could be five minutes from now.
Stacy : I want you to test him. Fine.
House : I'll send for an H.M.B.-synthase mutation.
House : Genetic test. Lab will get back to us in a month.
Stacy : Give him the cocktail, set off an attack.
UNK: No. Why not?
House : Because he doesn't want me to.
UNK: I'm not gonna sue you. I'm not gonna report you.
House : He might. He's paralyzed.
Stacy : Either you cure him, or he won't be writing any letters.
House : I'm not gonna do it. Why not?
House : You keep asking me that question. My answer doesn't change.
House : I gave him the parameters. It's his call.
UNK: You want him to die. I diagnosed him. I did my job.
House : You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment, you're way better at that than I am.
Stacy : Is that what this is? Payback for your leg? How many times have we been over this? I saved your life.
UNK: Yeah, maybe. You're gonna kill my husband to teach me a lesson?
UNK: No. He's gonna die 'cause he's too stubborn to make the right choice.
Stacy : Now we're in your territory.
House : I'm respecting your husband's decision. I don't see why you've got a problem with that.
Stacy : Because it's crap.
Stacy : Because you browbeat patients, intimidate them, lie to them.
Stacy : If you think you're right, you don't give a damn what they think.
Stacy : I did what you do all the time. The only difference is, I did it to you.
House : He'll never forgive you.
Stacy : Yeah. He will.
Foreman : Still no change. He's not getting worse?
Foreman : - No. No change at all. - And that's consistent with A.I.P., right?
Stacy : Until he has another attack, his condition's stable. Yeah.
UNK: Mark, you've got to. - I don't want to take that test, not until they're sure.
Stacy : - You don't know Greg. - Not like you do.
Mark : I only met him when he drugged me.
House : Boy, are my ears burning.
Mark : - What's that? - Cocktail hour.
UNK: Just 'cause you can't hoist a few doesn't mean you should be left out.
UNK: Get away from me. - Mark, if this is what he thinks is wrong with you...
Mark : You trust his judgment more than mine? His medical judgment.
Mark : And you'd bet my life on that? I would.
House : I don't.
UNK: Smart.
UNK: It's too bad you're paralyzed.
UNK: Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman.
House : Leave the room. It's not your problem. You need the consent from him.
UNK: But, Doc, he ain't right in the head. Then you need a court order.
House : Okay. Then get one. We'll wait here. I won't do nothin'.
