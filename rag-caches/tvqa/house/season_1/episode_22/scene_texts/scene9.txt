House : Oh! Love the Musketeer thing.
UNK: - I got goose bumps. - Give me the syringe.
Stacy : Please. If you're right, this may be his only shot.
House : So what's your plan? You take the big dark one, I've got the little girl,
House : and the Aussie will run like a scared wombat if things turn rough.
House : I can't do it.
Mark : You son of a bitch!
House : See what I did there?
UNK: When does it happen? - If he had A.I.P., should've already happened.
House : - Everyone's different. - This is not good.
UNK: He could have an embolism, tachycardia, stroke.
Stacy : What's happening? Two milligrams of Ativan.
Stacy : Is that an attack?
Stacy : - Here. - No. You'll pollute the sample.
House : - Chase, get urine from the catheter. - It's not an attack! He's stroking.
Chase : He needs Ativan!
UNK: This is not a stroke. The delta-wave burst is just a vasospasm.
Chase : Catheter's out. There's no way to collect the sample. - Heart rate's in the 40s. Bradycardia.
UNK: - We're losing him. - Hold him down. - Give him something!
UNK: No painkillers. You were wrong.
House : Straight from the bladder. That's as fresh as it gets.
UNK: Would you give him the Ativan already?
House : He doesn't need to be awake for this.
