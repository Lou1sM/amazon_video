Cameron : It's still yellow.
UNK: Move.
UNK: What? - You think another light's gonna make the difference?
House : Organic chem... More light, more oxidation.
UNK: Does that ring any bells?
House : Start the patient on 150 milligrams glucose, 75 milligrams Hematin.
UNK: Hey. Hey.
UNK: You wanna thumb wrestle?
Foreman : Come on. Oh!
Mark : He's still a maniac. I know.
Stacy : Dr. House?
Cameron : How's he doing?
House : Never better.
Mark : I thought...
Cameron : you were too screwed up to love anyone.
Cameron : I was wrong.
Cameron : You just couldn't love me.
House : That's good.
Cameron : I'm happy for you.
Stacy : You fixed him.
House : De nada.
Stacy : Thank you.
Stacy : You were right.
House : He's gonna be fine.
Stacy : No. About me.
House : I'm not over you.
Stacy : You were... You were the one.
Stacy : You always will be.
Stacy : But I can't be with you.
House : So I'm the guy,
House : but you want the other guy,
House : who, by definition, can never be the guy.
Stacy : What's so great about you is you always think you're right.
UNK: And what's so frustrating about you is you are right so much of the time.
Stacy : You are brilliant,
Stacy : funny, surprising, sexy.
Stacy : But with you, I was lonely. And with Mark, there's room for me.
UNK: Okay.
Cuddy : I want to run something by you.
House : I will not have sex with you! Not again.
UNK: It was miserable that first time.
House : All that desperate administrative need.
Cuddy : Stacy's husband is going to need close monitoring at the hospital,
Cuddy : and since we can definitely use her back here,
Cuddy : I've offered her a job... General counsel.
House : Did she say yes?
Cuddy : She said only if it was okay with you.
Cuddy : Yes or no?
House : Fine. Good.
