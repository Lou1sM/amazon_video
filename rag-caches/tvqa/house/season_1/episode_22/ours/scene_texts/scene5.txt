House : I don't know what's wrong with him.
House : It's not Alzheimer's. It's not encephalitis.
House : It's not environmental. It's not immunological.
House : Every test is negative every time.
House : He's perfectly healthy,
House : but his brain is dying.
Stacy : It never occurred to me...
Stacy : that you couldn't figure out what's wrong.
House : I haven't given up.
Stacy : So what do we do?
House : We wait.
Stacy : For what?
House : Something to change.
House : It's one of the great tragedies of life. Something always...
House : Something always changes.
UNK: Nurse?
UNK: Nurse!
Cameron : What happened? What's wrong?
Mark : My toes... They were numb, tingling, then nothing.
Mark : No pain. Nothing.
UNK: It's okay. They're going to take care of you.
Mark : I'm scared, Stacy. Hold my hand.
UNK: What?
Stacy : What's happening?
House : Time marches on. He's paralyzed.
Foreman : His symptoms mimic a peripheral nervous system under attack.
Chase : But he's experiencing significant paresthesias, and he can't move his hands or toes.
House : It's peripheral.
UNK: Guillain-BarrÃÂ¹ syndrome attacks there, not the brain.
Foreman : No. No. I already did an indirect Coombs' test.
UNK: No agglutination, no antibodies.
House : Initiative. Like that.
House : Start him on I.V. immuno...
Foreman : No antibodies means he doesn't have Guillain-BarrÃÂ¹, period.
UNK: Period? More like dot, dot, dot.
House : What if he has the virus but isn't producing those antibodies?
UNK: Come on. The chances of that... Didn't ask about the Vegas line. I said "what if".
Foreman : It would mean he's sick, and his body's not doing anything about it.
Cameron : So we either fight it for him or it's fatal.
House : Fatal sounds very bad to me.
UNK: Well, without the antibodies, we can't even test for it. Don't know if we're right.
House : Treatment isn't all that dangerous. Plasmapheresis and I.V.I.G.
House : If it works, we're right. If he dies... it was something else.
Mark : So the paralysis might not be permanent.
Cameron : That's our hope, but the brain's tricky. You never know.
Mark : What was that? What?
Mark : - With the head. The look. - He just wants to talk to me.
Mark : Well, if it was medical, he should be talking to me. - I'll be just outside the door.
Mark : Leave! Go talk to him.
UNK: - You're going to leave me anyway. - No. That's not gonna happen.
Mark : You left him, and he had a limp. If I can't walk or hold you?
Stacy : Honey, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to talk to him.
UNK: If I can't feed myself? - Mark, what you're feeling... It's not real. It's the virus.
UNK: - Mark? What is it? - Mark?
Cameron : His throat's closing up. He can't breathe. Code blue! Hurry!
Cameron : He's having a reaction to the I.V.I.G. I need epi, stat.
Cameron : - I can't get the scope in his throat. - Stop that.
