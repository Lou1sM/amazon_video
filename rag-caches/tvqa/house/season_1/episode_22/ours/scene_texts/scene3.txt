UNK: Grandparents, uncles, aunts. How was their health? Greg hates fishing.
Stacy : He's got a theory.
UNK: Most likely candidate right now is Alzheimer's.
Stacy : No. There's been no memory loss.
Stacy : I mean, he forgets where he left his keys, but who doesn't?
Cameron : Any family history?
Stacy : Of... whacked-outness?
Stacy : His sister voted for Nader, twice. That's about it.
Cameron : You were with House when it happened... to his leg?
UNK: Oh.
Stacy : You're interested in him.
Cameron : We went on one date.
Cameron : It didn't go very well.
UNK: Our first date didn't either. I was never gonna see him again. A week later, I moved in.
House : Five years. What would you like to know?
Cameron : What was he like before his leg?
Stacy : Pretty much the same.
Cameron : He's clear. No Alzheimer's.
Stacy : Yeah, that's what I figured.
