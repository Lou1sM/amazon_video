Cuddy : Some would consider that a sign of sanity.
House : Not the kid. Let's ask him. Oh, no, I forgot. We can't. He's dying.
Cuddy : Get the mother to sign off that she's refusing this treatment.
UNK: Good-bye.
House : "I, Margo Davis, have been informed of the risks...
House : which may arise from my refusal of advised medical care.
UNK: - I hereby release"... - Who are you?
UNK: I work for the hospital.
UNK: "The Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital and its employees,
UNK: agents and otherwise, for any adverse medical conditions resulting from my refusal.
House : It is not the hospital's fault if my son kicks off...
UNK: Kicks off? - I punched up the language. Mostly for clarification.
House : "I understand my doctors consider my decision to be completely idiotic"...
UNK: Why are you doing this? "But I am convinced I know more than they do.
UNK: I took a biology course in high school".
UNK: I assume that's... Yeah.
UNK: "Besides, I enjoy controlling every single aspect of my son's life,
House : even if it means his death".
House : Sign here, please. I brought a pen.
UNK: Who are you? I'm the doctor who's trying to save your son.
House : You're the mom who's letting him die.
House : Clarification... It's a beautiful thing.

House : She rethought her position. Start him on the hydrolase.
Cameron : No. We've got a problem.

Chase : Saline, atropine and diazepam, now.
UNK: His name is Chi Ling. He was admitted 12 minutes ago.
Cameron : Identical symptoms as Matt. Chase isn't sure he's gonna make it.
UNK: This one. Bag.
House : Matt's next-door neighbor, by any chance?
Cameron : They live 10 miles apart.
Cameron : Apparently, they don't even know each other.
UNK: Chi's Dad : We live in an apartment. We have two bamboo trees.
UNK: Chi's Dad : No pesticides. Just dry seaweed for fertilizer.
Chase : The second kid's heart is almost as weak as Matt's. We may need to get it wired up too.
UNK: And I don't know how long Matt's brain will hold up. His heart's not pumping enough oxygen.
House : How much are you giving him? 80%.
UNK: Make it 90. We're risking damage to his retina.
House : What the heck. Do it anyway. He's a calculus student.
House : Probably likes having a brain. I'll have Foreman take care of it.
UNK: I'm the primary. - Yeah, but the mom wants to get rid of you.
House : And you know me. I'm a people-pleasing kind of guy.
Chase : She complained? About me? She went to the principal.
UNK: Told Cuddy you took drugs in high school. This is gonna go on your permanent record.
Chase : I was trying to get information. It was a strategy.
House : She also used the word "slacker". You wanna come in?
House : Smoke a little weed? Watch some MTV?
Cameron : High school has no idea what could have happened.
