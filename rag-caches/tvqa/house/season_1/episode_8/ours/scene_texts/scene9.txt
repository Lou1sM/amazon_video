Mom : What is this?
House : Thought I'd hang out.
House : In case you change your mind.
UNK: Then I could give Matt the medicine right away.
House : Don't worry. I've got time.
Mom : The C.D.C. promised they'd call.
UNK: I'm sure they will.
House : Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the day after.
UNK: It takes time to review faxed records.
House : Then they'll probably tell you they can't make a decision based on faxed records.
UNK: This is Suzie.
House : She's never gonna marry him. No money.
Mom : What makes you think you're right this time?
House : Same reason as last time.
UNK: If you wanna see how the other kid does first, that's okay.
UNK: Might help you. Although there's a real good chance...
UNK: - What? Matt might kick off? - That's a little blunt.
House : I was gonna say "run out of time"...
UNK: or just kind of let my voice trail off.
UNK: Hello? Yes, this is Margo Davis.
Mom : But you have his records. I sent them.
Mom : Yes, I understand.
Mom : They can't help me. They haven't seen him.
House : They can't make a decision... Give it to him.
UNK: "The C.D.C. is unable to give an opinion at this time, ma'am.
Chase : We're gonna have a doctor in your area next week".
House : You fooled her with that?
UNK: House!
UNK: So I'm gonna be cured? As long as you don't wear any more poison pants.
Matt : I'm sorry, Mom. I knew the pants were stolen.
Matt : They were only five bucks. You're gonna give me hell, aren't you?
Mom : Oh, honey, I'm just glad you're alive.
Mom : Let's get you home so you can rest.
Mom : Maybe I am too hard on you.
Mom : You don't have to make up that test till next week.
Mom : You can stay in bed and work on your applications.
Foreman : Some guy was selling pants off the back of his truck near the school.
Foreman : When he wasn't busy as a clothing entrepreneur,
UNK: he did day labor at a cornfield out on Route 1.
UNK: He used the same truck for both jobs.
UNK: So he spilled pesticide on the pants and was too lazy to clean up.
UNK: Real question is why are you still here?
House : Why aren't you out there making up with the joyful mother?
Foreman : Why would I do that? No reason at all.
UNK: If you don't care about her. Or her son.
Georgia : Oh, Dr. House.
Mom : The C.D.C. called.
Georgia : - Again. - Oops.
UNK: Who are those guys? - Oh, they're the arrogant jerks that saved your life.
