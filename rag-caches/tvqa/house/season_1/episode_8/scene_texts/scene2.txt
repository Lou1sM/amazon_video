UNK: Nursing supervisor to the instrument room.
Georgia : - I feel good. - That's your complaint?
UNK: Your major symptom. I told her this was a waste of time.
Georgia : I notice colors more.
Georgia : And music! I... I'm really hearing music.
UNK: I'm 82, and I'm supposed to be playing canasta with the other old ladies,
Georgia : but now... when I see a guy with a cute butt,
UNK: I can't stop looking at him.
Georgia : Or... a sexy beard.
House : And you figure that enjoying cute butts is a sign of disease?
Georgia : It all started a month ago when Mark rented Gone With the Wind for me,
Georgia : but it had the wrong DVD in it.
UNK: Oh! Oh, right. I-I forgot. This is all my fault.
UNK: Ofcourse, he was too busy to bring it back. Yeah, like I don't have a life.
Georgia : So I watched it, and it had this actor in it...
Georgia : This kid called Ashton Kutcher.
Georgia : Now... I think about Ashton...
Georgia : all the time.
Georgia : All... the time.
Foreman : - Ah. - You remind me of him.
Georgia : Same bedroom eyes.
House : People are always mixing us up.
UNK: I-I-I suppose you... You need to check my heart?
UNK: No! No, no, that... that won't be necessary. - I told you.
House : But I am going to admit you to the hospital for tests.
Mark : What tests? She's just old. And you're just insufferable.
House : Your mother has had a sudden personality change. It should be checked out.
UNK: I'll have a nurse come in and admit her. I'm too handsome to do paperwork.
UNK: Anesthesiologist to O.R. Room 4.
UNK: Anesthesiologist to O.R. Room 4.
Mom : He's been on this medication for over an hour.
UNK: Pralidoxime is very effective. It just takes a little time for it to kick in.
UNK: And maybe you're wrong. Maybe it's not a pesticide.
Chase : The blood work was pretty conclusive. It's an organophosphate.
Mom : Oh, my God.
Chase : Move back. Ms. Davis, move back, please.
UNK: We're at 30. Bradycarciac arrest. Get me the pads.
Mom : What are you doing?
UNK: We're gonna beat his heart for him. Set it at 60.
Mom : I can't stand this anymore.
Chase : We'll keep him on the pads for another hour. Then what?
Chase : Let's see what happens.
Mom : Well, that's not my philosophy.
Mom : Especially when it comes to my son.
Mom : And if something bad might happen, I'd like to know what our options are.
Chase : The pralidoxime isn't doing him any good. We're gonna have to wire his heart.
Cameron : - Maybe we're wrong about the pesticides. - I ran his plasma again, twice.
Cameron : Are there any stronger treatments for the organophosphate poisoning?
UNK: Oh, damn it! You caught me. We went with the weak stuff. I was just trying to save a little money.
Foreman : Actually, one of my professors at Columbia developed an experimental treatment for the army.
UNK: What's the success rate? - They're targeted. There's a different hydrolase treatment for each poison.
UNK: We'd need to know if Matt got hit with Orthene or malathion...
Cameron : - What's the success rate? - Excellent, I'm sure. It's the U.S. Army.
UNK: "Be all you can be". Point is, what are the kid's chances without it?
Chase : Minimal at best. The poison's broken the blood-brain barrier.
UNK: I assume "minimal at best" is your stiff-upper-lip British way of saying "no chance in hell".
UNK: I'm Australian. - You put the queen on your money. You're British. Call your professor.
UNK: If we don't know what kind of organophosphate we're targeting,
