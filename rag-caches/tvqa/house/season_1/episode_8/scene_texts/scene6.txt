UNK: - I can't believe this. - Yeah, well, pinch yourself.
Georgia : I guess for the next two weeks, I'd better practice safe sex.
House : You'll be fine. Just feed that cranky kid.
Cameron : The county's worried about West Nile, so they sprayed ethyl-parathion right next to the bus route.
House : Do you have the hydrolase for ethyl-parathion?
UNK: Yeah. Only one problem. Matt's mother faxed his records to the C.D.C.
Foreman : She refuses to let us do anything until she hears back from them.
UNK: Well, you're getting good at this Godlike doctor racket.
House : Why don't you talk her out of this lunacy?
UNK: She's not really a big fan of mine. Or mine.
UNK: Well, only one man left in the bull pen, and he throws like a girl.
Cameron : I hate sports metaphors.
House : Give her the high, hard one.
Cameron : We really think the hydrolase is the only...
Mom : I'm thinking about transferring Matt out of here.
Cameron : Ms. Davis, your son is very sick. He won't survive a transfer.
Mom : I'm getting a second opinion from the Center for Disease Control.
Cameron : Right. Look, when my grandmother got sick...
Mom : What? You're gonna tell me some tough decision you had to make?
UNK: I know how hard this is for you. - Maybe embroider the story a little? Make it fit?
Cameron : I can't imagine being in your position.
Mom : Honesty. A kind of vulnerable honesty. That's your thing. And the looks.
UNK: Oh, boy. - They send a single woman to hustle the single mom.
Cameron : Actually, they sent a doctor!
Cameron : To tell you that if your son doesn't get this treatment,
Cameron : there's a good chance he'll die.
Mom : That's what House said about a treatment that would have killed Matt.
UNK: You've gotta do better than that. No, it's on you.
UNK: You need to do better. Right now. Yes or no?
Chase : - I don't know. - Figure it out.
UNK: Wait.
UNK: Nurse!
Teacher : - Help! - Okay. Coming.
Chase : - Seizing. Suction. - Watch his head.
Mom : My son!
UNK: - Coming. - Diazepam.
UNK: Got it.
Chase : - Suction. - Ten milligrams.
UNK: Right. - He's not responding. Another 10 milligrams.
Mom : You're killing him!
Mom : - You're killing him! - Get her out of here. Get her outta here!
UNK: Come on, ma'am. Ma'am?
