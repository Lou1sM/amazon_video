Foreman : Severe bradycardia. Heart rate's down to 48 and falling fast.
House : You know the kid? No, he just came in.
House : Mom real good looking? I... didn't notice.
House : Then it's a mystery.
House : Not why he's sick, but why you care so much.
House : Gift shop's open. Buy him a card. He's not responding to atropine.
House : Boys love fart jokes. Find one with a good fart joke.
House : He's a teenager. It's drugs.
House : Tell those E.R. geniuses to give him charcoal and naloxone. Stop following me.
Foreman : His tox screen was negative. He's still whacked out.
House : You don't care about the kid. You just find his illness intriguing.
Foreman : His CAT scan was clean. There's no sign of infection. It's not diabetes.
House : And you don't care about him.
UNK: If that's what you wanna hear, not in the slightest.
House : Me neither. May as well be objective.
Cameron : Maybe it's shigellosis.
House : Wouldn't account for the bradycardia.
Chase : Viral myocarditis?
House : Wouldn't account for the whacked out.
UNK: So, what's the differential for a negative tox screen? - He was clean.
Cameron : - Unless someone screwed up the test. - That never happens.
Chase : Or he O.D.'d on something we didn't test for. 1.4-Butanediol would give you these symptoms.
UNK: - That's a new one. - Copy machine toner.
House : Same punch as G.H.B. A little pricier. Way more dangerous.
UNK: On the other hand, it is legal. I want you to go to his house and find his stash.
UNK: I'll bet you know all the good hiding spots.
Foreman : Actually, I never did drugs.
House : Better go with him. In case he gets high.
House : - How much atropine is the kid getting? - One m.l.
UNK: Make it two. In case he needs his heart later on.
Chase : Matt, did you take any drugs this morning?
Matt : Pencils down.
Chase : Can you squeeze my fingers for me?
Chase : Did anyone give you anything to help with the math test?
Teacher : - Matt? - I told you. He doesn't take drugs.
Chase : Ms. Davis, all parents think that about their children,
Chase : and they're usually wrong.
Chase : I gave my mum a little trouble when I was his age.
UNK: I turned out okay. Even she thought so.
Mom : I know my kid. The fact that you did drugs doesn't mean he did.
Chase : Did he go anywhere last night?
Mom : No, he was home studying.
Chase : - Any friends come over to help him? - And bring him drugs?
Mom : Is that what your friends did? Ms. Davis.
Mom : Look, I tested him myself.
Mom : The home kit. I took some hair off his brush.
Mom : I didn't want him to know about it, because I do trust him.
Chase : Then why did you test him?
Mom : All he did last night was study and argue about his college interviews.
Mom : He wants to be himself... No haircut, ratty old clothes.
Mom : That'll go over big.
Mom : Then we both gave up and went to bed. That's it.
Chase : Has he ever had any problems like this before? Any family history?
