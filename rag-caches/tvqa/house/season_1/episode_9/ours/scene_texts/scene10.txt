House : Otherwise, you should get him to buy you two or three more nostalgic lunches and then politely decline.
Foreman : It's that simple? I should just ignore the mockery and abuse?
House : - Oh, how do I abuse you? - How do you not?
Foreman : - If I make a mistake... - I hold you accountable. So what?
Foreman : Dr. Hamilton forgives. He's capable of moving on. - That is not what he does.
Foreman : I screwed up his case. He told me... He never said you were forgiven.
House : I was there. He said it wasn't your fault.
Tommy : - So? - So, it was.
House : You took a chance. You did something great.
House : You were wrong, but it was still great. You should feel great that it was great.
House : You should feel like crap that it was wrong. That's the difference between him and me.
House : He thinks you do your job, and what will be will be.
House : I think that what I do and what you do matters.
House : He sleeps better at night. He shouldn't.
Cameron : - Arteriovenous malformation. - Intradural. Compressing his spine.
House : Causing his paralysis.
Foreman : How could Hamilton have missed an A.V.M.?
House : Well, we missed it too,
House : 'cause it wasn't there before.
UNK: Are you saying it just grew overnight?
UNK: No.
House : It was on the spine. It wasn't on the M.R.I.
House : - Same anatomic location. - It's not there.
House : - Well, what is there? - Nothing.
House : Or something that looks like nothing.
Cameron : Background noise. Static. Scar tissue? Inflammation?
Foreman : If it's inflammation, the steroids would've shrunk it down.
House : Revealing the A.V.M.,
House : which has always been there, hiding behind its own swelling.
House : We remove that, he'll walk again.
Foreman : Dr. House.
John : Cora's meeting me outside with the limo.
UNK: I'm bein' discharged.
House : Fifty bucks says I can beat you to the curb.
UNK: Thanks for stickin' with the case.
House : I can't do anything else.
House : You're much more easily amused when you can walk.
John : How bizarre.
UNK: I'm guessing that you weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine...
John : even before your leg got messed up.
John : I want you to have this.
UNK: Wow.
John : You can sell it if you want to. Just promise me you won't play it.
John : How many of those pills you takin'?
House : I'm in pain.
UNK: Yes.
John : Aren't we all?
John : So, uh, where do you buy these things? Do they have cane stores?
UNK: Ah, don't worry about it. You'll be jogging before you need a second one.
House : See you tomorrow, Eric.
