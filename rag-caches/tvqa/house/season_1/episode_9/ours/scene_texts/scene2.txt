Cameron : Mucus plug? No, it's our mistake.

House : Everyone knows what's wrong with me. What's wrong with him is more interesting.
UNK: You tubed him, and he didn't want to be tubed. He has a legal paper saying just that.
House : To intubate or not to intubate... That is the big ethical question.
House : Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it and maybe just practice some medicine.
UNK: There is no question. It's the patient's decision.
House : If the patient is competent to make it.
