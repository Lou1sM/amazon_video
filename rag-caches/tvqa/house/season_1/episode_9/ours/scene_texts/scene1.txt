John : So you think the breathing stuff is connected to my A.L.S.?
Foreman : It makes sense.
John : So it's just gonna get worse, huh?
Foreman : - Well, Dr. Hamilton... - Great guy.
John : Really smart doctor, and his treatment obviously isn't working.
John : Do you think I'm gonna die here, or you think I get to go back home first?
Foreman : An M.R.I. would give us a better idea... Oh, an M.R.I. Come on. For pneumonia?
Foreman : Dr. House thinks we should test for other... House?
John : Yeah, I heard about him. Obsessive son of a bitch? That's him.
John : So who do you think is right, Hamilton or House?
UNK: Hey, they're both excellent physicians.
John : Come on.
UNK: One of 'em says A.L.S. The other one says not A.L.S.
John : You gotta pick one, son.
Foreman : Everything points to A.L.S.
John : Then no M.R.I.
John : And I want one of them papers that say, uh, I don't want nothing done if something go bad.
Foreman : A D.N.R.? Mr. Giles, you don't want to rush into...
John : It's been two years. I ain't rushin'. I want to sign one.
UNK: Now.
John : While my arm still works.
Foreman : He signed a D.N.R.
House : He rhymes with dinner?
Foreman : He signed a D.N.R.
House : Oh. That makes more sense.
House : - You tell him it might not be A.L.S.? - No.
House : Well, no wonder he signed. Who wouldn't?
Foreman : I started him on I.V. steroids and Synthroid.
House : Great. If it was my case, I'd be adding a little I.V.I.G. to the mix.
Foreman : - For his pneumonia? - That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
Foreman : He doesn't want anything done. No treatment.
House : D.N.R. means "Do not resuscitate", not "Do not treat".
UNK: You do nothing, doesn't matter which one of us is right.
House : And hang on to that D.N.R.
House : That signature could be worth a lot of money real soon.
Foreman : This is Dr. Foreman. What is Mr. Giles's status?
Foreman : Okay. Increase the steroids to 100 milligrams every 12 hours and, uh...
Foreman : Start him on I.V.I.G.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. One gram per kilo.
Willie : My nature isn't what it used to be.
Willie : The little man has lost some bounce in his step.
Willie : He needs to crank it up, have himself some fun this weekend.
UNK: He wants the blue pills. You're taking about your penis in the third person.
Willie : Me and him... two people.
House : Separate vacations? That'd be a drag for one of you.
House : I don't think you need the pills. I think you have a conflict in medications.
UNK: You need to up your insulin to chocolate chip ice-cream levels. - Insulin?
House : Yeah. You remember. That's the stuff you take for the diabetes...
House : that you forgot to tell the nurse about.
House : Your hands...
House : No hair, which means nerve damage.
House : And your shoes look about two sizes too small, which means you've lost sensation in your feet.
House : And then there's your pants.
UNK: My pants tell you I have diabetes? No. They tell me you're an idiot.
House : Powdered sugar on the right pant leg.
House : Based on the two napkins in your pocket...
UNK: I'd bet it's not your first doughnut of the day.
Willie : You're giving me the pills? Sure. Why not?
House : If you've got heart disease from ignoring the diabetes, they'll kill you.
UNK: Otherwise, you two have a fun weekend.
