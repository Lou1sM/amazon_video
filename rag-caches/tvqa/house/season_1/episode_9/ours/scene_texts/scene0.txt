House : I want in.
Cuddy : - John Henry Giles? You a fan of his music? - He's a musician?
House : That paralysis thing... Guy can't walk for two years.
House : Nobody knows why. It seems mildly interesting.
Cuddy : - Forget his paralysis. - Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.
Cuddy : As far as this hospital is concerned, this is a simple case of lobar pneumonia.
UNK: Boring. - But that not-walking thing... That could turn into something serious.
Cuddy : Marty Hamilton is his primary physician out in California. He's dealing with the paralysis.
House : Know all about it. Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries...
UNK: He's making real progress. Fixed everything but the legs.
Cuddy : Dr. Hamilton already called and asked for your team.
Cuddy : And by team, I don't mean you.
UNK: Like I always say, there's no "I" in team.
House : There is a "me" though, if you jumble it up.
Cuddy : Foreman did his residency with Hamilton.
UNK: I know. I accidentally glanced at his rÃÂ¹sumÃÂ¹ before I hired him.
Cuddy : He wants someone he can trust.
UNK: He must've spoken to Foreman's parole officer.
Cuddy : Someone who will stick to the pneumonia.
Cuddy : John Henry's on an experimental protocol for the paralysis. I respect that.
UNK: I'm not gonna get in his way. It's Foreman's case.
House : It's pneumonia. He can handle it.
House : Guy's already paralyzed. How badly can he screw it up?
UNK: So,
UNK: - what are his sats? - Staying in the 90s on the nasal cannula.
UNK: - Coughing up sputum? - Almost none. He seems stabilized.
Foreman : Dr. House, is there anything back from micro? - Not yet. You gonna fire me?
Foreman : - You can make up for it by washing my car. - Oh, this is fun.
UNK: Okay. Let's keep him on the broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Foreman : And since he's displaying septic physiology,
Foreman : draw blood for adrenal and thyroid function.
UNK: - What about the paralysis? - We're sticking to the pneumonia.
House : Well, you certainly are, boss, like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice.
Foreman : The paralysis has already been diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton.
Foreman : - It's A.L.S. - Lou Gehrig's disease.
House : It's a lovely diagnosis. They make movies about it.
House : No tests, no treatment... It's a disease of exclusion.
Foreman : Because Hamilton has excluded everything else. - I haven't.
House : What else could it be?
UNK: Guillain-BarrÃÂ¹, which would be reversible. - Excellent.
Foreman : No. The progression of the paralysis would be symmetric. His wasn't.
Cameron : - Transverse myelitis. - Hamilton tested for it. Negative.
Foreman : And he was negative for masses and A.V.M...
UNK: Antibodies could be attacking the nerves. Multifocal motor neuropathy. - Uncommon, but it fits.
House : It's also treatable. Did Hamilton try putting the guy on I.V.I.G.?
UNK: - No, because the M.R.I. showed no... - Well, let's do an M.R.I. of our own.
Foreman : Guys, it's my case.
Foreman : A.L.S. fits. It even predicts the pneumonia. The paralysis is progressive.
House : It's a death sentence. That doesn't make it wrong.
