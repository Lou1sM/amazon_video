UNK: One of us is gonna do this to you twice a day for the next two weeks.
UNK: - I'm ready. Go. - He could get syphilis...
Dad : even if he's not sexually active?
UNK: Well, it's... it's unusual, but it's possible.
UNK: Okay. Relax.
House : It's infected, with a really big hole,
House : like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure.
UNK: I wouldn't do that. Although the wound is irregular.
UNK: It's not cylindrical. It's shaped like a triangle. So, not a nail.
House : - Steak knife? - Wife's nail file.
Funsten : Nail file.
House : Yeah. Pain will make you do stupid things.
House : - Something to take the edge off? - Yeah.
UNK: Cheers.
UNK: So, you have family here in Princeton?
UNK: No. Here on work?
Funsten : - No. Why are you... - Does your penis hurt?
Funsten : No. What? Should it?
House : No. Just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question.
UNK: Your lawyer's gonna love it. - Why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.
House : - You're from Maplewood, New Jersey, right? - Yeah.
House : Now, why would you drive 70 miles...
House : to get treatment for a condition that a nine-year-old could diagnose?
House : It's the free-flowing pus that's the tip-off.
UNK: I was in town. Not for family. Not for work.
UNK: You drove 70 miles to a walk-in clinic. You passed two hospitals on the road.
UNK: Either you've got a problem with those hospitals, or they have a problem with you.
UNK: My guess is you've sued half the doctors in Maplewood,
House : and the rest are now refusing to help you.
House : It's ironic, isn't it? Sort of like the boy who sued wolf.
UNK: You know, I bet we have a doctor here named Wolf.
House : How perfect would that be?
House : - I'm gonna page him. - Okay. You know what? Thank you.
Funsten : I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.
House : I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.
House : We'll drain your knee, run some lab work. Fix you up. - Why would you do that?
House : I'm a people person.
Wilson : You actually treated him?
UNK: All I know is he sued some doctors.
UNK: Who am I to assume they didn't have it coming to them?
House : The cutest little tennis outfit. My God, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.
UNK: Oh, my. Didn't see you there. That is so embarrassing. How's your hooker doing?
House : Sweet of you to ask. Funny story.
UNK: She was gonna be hospital administrator, but just hated having to screw people like that.
Cuddy : - Heard you found her on the roof. - You have very acute hearing.
Cuddy : You notify the parents?
UNK: In due course, ofcourse.
Cuddy : And is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient?
UNK: Doesn't sound like me. Well, it does, actually, but doesn't mean you're guilty.
Wilson : You think? I saw the parents in the lobby.
UNK: Smart money's obviously on the father. - My guy knows a guy who can get you in for 50 bucks.
UNK: Fine. Tell your guy, if I win, you attend the faculty symposium, and you wear a tie.
House : And if I win, no clinic hours for a week.
Cuddy : My guy will call your guy.
Wilson : She's very good at her job.
Chase : The treatments should start helping soon.
Chase : Let us know if it gets easier to focus on things, remember stuff.
Chase : Hey, Dan. Isn't Dr. Cameron's necklace a beauty?
Chase : Something South American, I think.
Cameron : Yeah. Guatemalan.
Dan : It's a cool necklace.
Cameron : - Thank you so much. - The kid's in pain.
UNK: Don't fight it. Just let it happen. No.
UNK: You'll be dead in two days. No what?
UNK: Female Voice 2 : I give it a day. Dan? You okay?
UNK: Dan?
Cameron : Night terrors. Decomposition once he's in the grave.
UNK: - Say good-bye to your mother and father. - He's hearing voices.
UNK: You're dying. It's all over, Dan.
UNK: You're dying. Dying. Dead!
UNK: Push two milligrams I.V. Ativan, stat.
UNK: It's all over. Come on, Dan.
Dan : Get out of my head!
Cameron : Auditory hallucination shows further brain degeneration.
UNK: Penicillin's not working. So either it's a bad batch of penicillin,
