UNK: What does that tell you? - Nothing. It's just fun watching him blink.
House : Name as many animals as you can that begin with the letter "B". Go.
Dan : - Baby elephant? - Baby elephant is actually a good answer.
House : - "B" is a bear of a letter. - What does that tell you?
UNK: Proves two things : no neurological damage, and your son is never gonna be chief fry cook.
UNK: In teens, there are two likely causes of night terrors.
UNK: Posttraumatic stress. Any recent shoot-outs at your high school? - No.
House : - Then, Dave... - Dan.
House : If there's no trauma, the other cause is... sexual abuse.
House : So who's molesting you? Teacher?
UNK: Extra-friendly neighbor? I'd ask if either of you were involved, but you'd deny it.
UNK: We would never hurt Dan.
House : I say it here, it comes out there.
House : This lack of response is consistent with abuse.
UNK: There's no one, okay? I... I swear.
UNK: There was trauma. I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.
House : Did you know that he got hit in the head?
Cameron : - They didn't mention it. No. - Yeah. Why bother?
Dad : No, no. We took him to the E.R. after the game.
Dad : He was scanned. They tested him. They said he was fine.
Dad : No concussion. It's gotta be something else.
House : You hound me for my opinion, and then you question my diagnosis.
House : Cool. E.R. obviously screwed up. Kid's got a concussion.
UNK: I had double vision before I was hit. Well, that changes everything.
House : You need glasses. That's why you had double vision,
House : which is why you got hit, which is why you have a concussion, which is why you have night terrors.
House : You need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not.
Cameron : You enjoyed that. I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.
House : You're an only child, aren't you? Why would you say that?
UNK: Because everything is about you.
House : This may seem incredibly controversial, but I think sexual abuse is bad.
House : I just wanted to make sure he wasn't being diddled by Daddy... or Mommy.
House : Anything else is just a bonus.
Cameron : I'm not an only child. Interesting.
UNK: What? Don't move.
House : - Did I bore you in there? - What? Uh, no. Not... Not really.
House : Are you tired?
Dan : - Sometimes. - He never sleeps. Ofcourse he's tired.
House : - Right now. At this moment. Are you tired? - No. No.
House : That twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?
Dan : - Didn't hurt. - His leg twitched. I don't see what...
House : It's called a myoclonic jerk. It's very common when you're falling asleep.
UNK: Respiration rate falls, and the brain sometimes interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up.
Wilson : - So? - So, he's not asleep.
House : He's awake.
House : Admit him.
House : I recognize that loopy "G".
