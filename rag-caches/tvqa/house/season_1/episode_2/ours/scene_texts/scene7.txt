House : or our diagnosis is wrong.
House : Square one.
UNK: Midnite. L.F. T.'s, B.U.N. and creatinine are all normal.
UNK: - Diabetes is out, and no gap. - There goes metabolic.
UNK: - M.R.A. rules out vasculitis. - "I" for inflammation.
Chase : - Too young for anything degenerative. - "D", see ya.
House : "N" for neoplastic. M.R.I. was clean.
House : - "I" for inflammation. - We already did that.
UNK: Stupid to have two I's in one mnemonic. What's the other one? - Infection.
UNK: Oligoclonal bands still have to mean something. - But no fevers. White count's elevated, but within range.
Chase : We've tested for anything remotely possible. Everything's negative.
Cameron : - C.T. scan rules out subdural. - Trauma. Later much.
UNK: You know the problem? "Midnight" is actually spelled with a "G" and an "H".
House : If we could just figure out what those letters stand for.
House : It's a sick brain, having fun,
House : torturing him, talking to him.
House : Scaring the hell out of him.
House : Get him an E.E.G., left and right E.O.G., esophageal microphones.
House : If this thing wants to talk, let's listen.
House : We're missing something. This is screwed-up.
Wilson : That's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing?
UNK: I panicked, okay?
House : Sounded cool though. They bought it.
House : Oh, crap.
House : Another reason I don't like meeting patients. If they don't know what you look like, they can't yell at you.
House : Here we go.
Mom : How can you just sit there?
House : If I eat standing up, I spill.
Dad : Our son is dying, and you could care less.
Dad : We're going through hell. You're doing nothing?
House : I'm sorry. You need to vent. I understand. - Don't be condescending.
Dad : You haven't checked in on him once.
UNK: Blood pressure is 110 over 70.
UNK: His shunt is patent, well-placed in the right lateral ventricle.
UNK: The E.K.G. shows a normal Q.R.S. with deep-wave inversions throughout both limb and precordial leads.
UNK: L.F. T.'s are elevated, but only twice the normal range.
House : Oh, yeah. And he's hearing voices.
House : Go hold his hand.
UNK: Go on. I'll bus your tray.
House : - Got any sample bags on you? - I don't believe you.
Wilson : You're gonna run D.N.A. tests? Their son is deathly ill.
House : I know. It's terrible. But the fact is, if I don't keep busy with trivial things like this,
House : I'm afraid I might start to cry. You're an ass.
House : Yeah? You want to double the bet?
House : General Hospital is on channel 6.
Foreman : Dan's brain's not showing channel 6 right now. Only mush.
House : No epileptiform activity.
Dan : What are you doing? Waiting for C.B.C. and CHEM-7.
House : Good. Run D.N.A. on these.
Cameron : What's this? Parents' coffee cups.
UNK: I can't believe you. I've had this conversation once already.
House : If you've got something else to do, do it. Otherwise, do this.
UNK: Dan's Dad : Dr. House. Hey. Mr. Funsten.
House : I was wondering when you'd be back. You got some papers for me?
Funsten : You've caused me considerable mental distress. I certainly hope so.
UNK: What? Too cheap to get your lawyer to serve it for you, or is it just more fun this way?
Funsten : I'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement.
House : You have gonorrhea.
UNK: No, I don't. Well, maybe you're right, but I have the lab result says you do.
House : Could be a false positive, and normally I'd run a second test,
House : but since you're here, I'll just go with the first. You're just trying to scare me.
House : It's reportable, you know. Public health issue. I'll be sure to let my wife know.
