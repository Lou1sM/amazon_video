House : It's my leg. It's my life.
Stacy : Would you give up your leg to save my life?
UNK: Ofcourse I would.
Stacy : Why do you think your life is worth less than mine?
Stacy : If this were any other patient, what would you tell them to do?
House : I would say it's their choice. Not a chance.
Stacy : You'd browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right.
Stacy : You'd shove it in their face that it's just a damn leg.
Stacy : You don't think you deserve to live?
