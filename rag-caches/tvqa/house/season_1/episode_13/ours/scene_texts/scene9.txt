Cameron : He's your father. You never see him, and he's here.
Cameron : Unless he's done some unspeakable thing, you should lighten up.
UNK: Great. Thanks for the tip.
UNK: Okay.
Cameron : He beat your mom. He beat you.
House : What did he do? Really, don't push it.
Cameron : All this hate. It's toxic.
Chase : Then stay away.
Chase : There's nothing there.
Chase : No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing.
Chase : It's not neurofibromatosis.
UNK: Drs. Chase are 0 for 3. Even when they agree, they're wrong.
House : So, next, what else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules? Berger's disease.
UNK: He's never been out of the country. - Have his parents? They could have brought it back.
UNK: I don't think so. - It doesn't matter. His lesions are in the wrong place. His feet are the one clear spot.
House : - Kid's dad mentioned leishmaniasis. - Yeah, and filariasis.
UNK: But the throat nodules still don't fit with that. - That's two diseases pretty much exclusive to Southeast Asia.
House : What if the anthrax didn't set off the second disease?
UNK: We're back at coincidence again? - No. What if something else was the trigger?
Cameron : - Nothing else happened. - We happened.
UNK: Antibiotics? - We've been through this. It's not an allergy.
UNK: I gotta pee.
Jeffrey : - What did the C.T. scan tell you? - Nothing.
UNK: Ow! Scale from one to 10... how painful?
UNK: Not half as painful as when I punch you in the face. Don't do that. It'll hurt you.
House : Carpal tunnel surgery obviously didn't work. - Who are you?
House : The little ones call me Uncle Greg. Your dad never had carpal tunnel.
House : You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase. How did you know about them?
UNK: I read about them on the Internet. - What did you search for... "Diseases from Asia that don't match my son's symptoms"?
UNK: - You head about them in Asia. - I've never been there.
House : Well, you probably just forgot. Let me refresh your memory :
House : some remote, dusty village, close quarters, at least a year?
House : - Starting to come back? - I'm calling Dr. Cuddy.
Sarah : Excuse me, what does this have to do with our son?
House : Your dad's pissed off. He should be.
UNK: Comes here expecting us to do an extra-good job because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital.
Jeffrey : - Don't talk to my son like that! - Just telling him my job and my obligation...
UNK: Stop! What's going on?
House : There's only one thing you guys have gotta do.
House : Tell the truth, or your son will die.
House : How long were you in Asia?
Sarah : Jeff, it's a simple question.
Jeffrey : Two years, in India.
Sarah : Why would you lie about something like that? It was '87 and '88.
Tommy : This, uh...
Jeffrey : This guru... I-I thought he had some answers.
Jeffrey : I went to his ashram...
Jeffrey : and, um, ended up with no money and no answers.
Jeffrey : I was embarrassed. I didn't want anyone to know.
UNK: No.
Gabe : No. You were a test pilot.
Jeffrey : I'm so sorry, Gabe.
Sarah : What does this have to do with my son?
UNK: Clue number one : If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine.
Foreman : Demonic possession? Close, but no wafer.
UNK: Clue number two : Rheumatology Rowan was almost right. It causes autoimmune symptoms.
UNK: Leprosy? - Yeah, that's real big in the Jersey suburbs.
House : It's leprosy. Run a Fite stain. It'll be positive.
House : Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of Indian ashram.
Foreman : But it's obviously dormant in the dad. How could the kid catch it?
House : It's not dormant in the dad. It's just slow.
UNK: Damaged his ulnar nerves. Was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel.
