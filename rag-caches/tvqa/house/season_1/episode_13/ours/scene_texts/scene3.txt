House : Hard to miss... you know, the big hug and how happy he was to see you.
House : Need a consult. With a patient.
House : Urgent doctor stuff.
UNK: Twenty-six-year-old male, sudden loss of the ability to speak...
Wilson : Just because you got out of clinic duty doesn't mean everybody did. To his father.
House : Differential diagnosis? Chase?
House : Dad swoops in, Chase swoops out.
Wilson : Dad say why he was here? See? You asked.
House : Dad comes 5,000 miles, you're more curious than Junior is.
House : Can't just be about the divorce.
UNK: It's been 15 years, and Mom's been dead for 10 of them. You think Daddy murdered her?
Wilson : You want to get to the bottom of this, you're doing it exactly right :
Wilson : Don't talk to the people involved. Drag your buddy away from work for some pointless speculation.
House : You want to know how two chemicals interact, do you ask them?
UNK: No. They're gonna lie through their lying little chemical teeth.
House : Throw them in a beaker and apply heat.
Wilson : Even I don't like you.
House : You know, words can hurt.
Chase : Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, guys. I don't care that you're up here.
Dave : - You a cop? - Doctor. I'm treating Gabe Reilich.
Chase : - He said he fell over near some pipes? - Yeah, over there.
Chase : - What, here? - Yeah.
Chase : Any of you guys been feeling sick lately? Rash, cold, anything? - No.
Dave : Oh, crap. He is a cop! Damn it!
Chase : He fell on it... Some weird kind of insulation.
Chase : It's old. House was built in the '60s.
Cameron : What's it made of? Felt, fibers of... what, cotton?
House : Sorry. Forgotten how funny your dad was.
Chase : Not as funny as you. High praise.
House : I know how protective kids can be of their parents.
House : Not cotton. Animal hair.
UNK: Get me the C.T. scan.
House : First, find the name of the company that made the insulation,
House : and second, tell me what I'm seeing that makes me want to short their stock.
Foreman : Uh, enlarged hilar lymph nodes.
UNK: Peribronchial thickening. Pleural effusions.
House : Less obvious, more scary.
Chase : Well, the mediastinum doesn't look right.
Cameron : Slightly widened.
Cameron : Oh, God.
Cameron : It can be transmitted through infected animal hair.
UNK: But the Gram's stain would have shown... No. The cefuroxime would have killed some of it, clouded the result.
Cameron : We've gotta get this kid on levaquin.
Foreman : What does he have?
House : Anthrax. This house belong to old man Hussein?
Chase : Maybe he is cursed.
Jeffrey : Anthrax. So, what... you think there were terrorists in that attic?
Chase : It's a naturally occurring bacteria.
Chase : - We believe it was in the insulation. - How sick is he?
Chase : Anthrax is very dangerous, but we've caught it early. He's on levaquin. It's the best antibiotic we have.
UNK: Lisa, you buy this? Jeff, you've helped our hospital a lot.
