Cuddy : I wouldn't have assigned Dr. House to your case if I didn't have every confidence in him.
UNK: - Then who's this guy? - Jeffrey!
Jeffrey : There's all these weird diseases that can cause a rash. What about leishmaniasis or filariasis?
Cuddy : Where'd you hear about those? Internet. I did some research.
UNK: Well, those are very rare conditions. Oh, and anthrax grows along the interstate?
Chase : Leishmaniasis doesn't cause pneumonia, and filariasis...
Jeffrey : Just look into everything. This is my son, all right?
UNK: And I'm gonna stay on top of you until I know he's safe. I wouldn't expect anything else.
Cuddy : Everyone's a doctor.
Sarah : Breathe, baby. It's okay. Breathe. I need you to breathe.
Jeffrey : His breathing... It's on the inhale.
Sarah : What does that mean? It means his airway's closing up.
UNK: Is the anthrax doin' it?
Chase : All right. Hold still, Gabe. This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.
Cuddy : We've got you. It's okay.
Chase : - Nodules in his throat. - Airway's occluded?
Chase : - We've got to intubate. Ativan! - Pushing 3 c.c.'s.
UNK: Airway's too tight. - What's wrong? What's wrong? No, you're killing him!
UNK: Jeffrey! Let them do their job. - Airway's too tight. Get me a smaller tube.
Chase : - We're traching. - Smaller tube.
Cuddy : - His lips are cyanotic. - He's not breathing.
Chase : Foreman, we're traching. No. I can do it. I'll get it.
Chase : - Foreman, you're not getting through. - He's not getting air.
Cuddy : - We have to trach him right now. - No, I can do it.
UNK: Betadine.
Chase : I'm doing this.
Foreman : Got it.
