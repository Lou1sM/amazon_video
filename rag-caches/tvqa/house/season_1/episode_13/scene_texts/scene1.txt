Jeffrey : We don't let him run wild through the neighborhood, right?
Chase : Okay. This might be a bit delicate.
Chase : - We need to know if you're sexually active. - I beg your pardon?

Gabe : One time I broke this mirror,
Gabe : the next week my parents got separated.
UNK: My parents split up too.
UNK: Every kid feels like it's his fault. It never is.
Chase : So, what about the rest of the stuff? Any playing outside your parents don't know about?
Chase : Anything like that?
Chase : Maybe you were somewhere you weren't supposed to be?
UNK: Triage nurse, pick up line 274. Oh, man.
Chase : Gabe, it's important.
UNK: A secret club. What's the secret... they're all morons?
Chase : He fell on something in the attic, scraped his arm, got the rash the next day.

Chase : Sorry, I've gotta go.
