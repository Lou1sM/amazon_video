UNK: Start Brandon on FAB fragments, and get him some Tylenol for the hair I pulled out.
UNK: And get some air in here.
UNK: Make a note. I should never doubt myself.
Wilson : I think you'll remember. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to be wrong every now and then.
House : What, you don't care about these people?
Foreman : The colchicine interferes with the ability of the heart muscle to contract,
Foreman : pumping blood, lowering your blood pressure.
Foreman : The antibodies we're giving you should neutralize the colchicine,
Foreman : allowing your heart to beat at its normal rate.
Brandon : When will you know?
Cameron : We know now.
UNK: Thank God.
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Big weekend? It's not for me. I'm fully stocked.
Wilson : - Cuddy got you doing inventory? - Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.
Wilson : The gout medicine O.D.? Yeah.
UNK: The fact that I know it's a gout medicine O.D. would indicate the case is already solved.
House : Well, you'd be wrong.
Wilson : What about the fact that the kid is now... I believe the technical term is... "not sick"?
House : You know how many forms of colchicine there are on the market?
Wilson : - Stop it. - Neither do I. But it's a lot.
UNK: Pills, powders, liquids, I. V. fluids.
House : Somewhere at a party, in his coffee, up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.
Wilson : You're not happy with your Ecstasy theory?
House : - He said he used it twice. - People lie.
House : - If you're gonna lie, it's... - You know what? I'm not interested.
House : - Not curious? - No. Because I'm well-adjusted.
UNK: Right.
Cameron : Temperature's normal. I want cousin Sharon there.
UNK: Mrs. Merrell : If we invite Sharon, we have to invite all the cousins.
UNK: So what? My side of the family doesn't need anything.
UNK: I don't suppose I could have some of those cough pills, huh? They're okay, right?
Cameron : - Yes. You're doing great. - You should invite Dr. House.
Brandon : - Will he come? - No. But he'll send a gift.
Cameron : I'll make sure it's a good one.
Brandon : There's a letter on the back of these pills.
Cameron : Your old pills didn't have a letter on them?
UNK: No. Round and yellow, but no letter.
Cameron : Well, these will help your cough.
UNK: Hey, you wanna go get some... No.
