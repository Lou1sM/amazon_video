UNK: No. I think we're gonna do it by standing around watching other people work.
Chase : I'm waiting for the Epstein-Barr virus.
Chase : - She's weird, isn't she? - Bad idea.
House : - What? - Bad idea. You work with her.
Chase : What did I say?
UNK: Is weird some new ghetto euphemism for sexy, like bad is good and phat is good?
Chase : - Then what the hell does "good" mean? - "Ghetto euphemism"?
Foreman : You don't think she's hot?
UNK: No.
Foreman : Wow. Then you're brilliant. And I am using "brilliant" as a euphemism.
Chase : Obviously, the girl is hot. Y-You're not talking about her aesthetics.
Chase : You're talking about if I want to jump her. I don't.
UNK: Brilliant.
UNK: Your Epstein-Barr is ready.
UNK: Clinic Patient : What are you doing? Level four.
UNK: No, no. I mean... I know what you meant. We're waiting.
Patient : My throat hurts. So you said.
UNK: How long are we waiting? Two minutes less than when you asked me two minutes ago.
Brandon : - Hi. - Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.
House : Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. His throat seems to have some condition.
Cuddy : Say "Ah". Ah.
Cuddy : He has a sore throat.
UNK: Ofcourse. Yes, why didn't I...
House : I mean, because he said that it hurt, and I should have deduced that meant it was sore.
Cuddy : I was in a board meeting. Patients come first, right?
Cuddy : Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there's any doubt about its efficacy, huh?
UNK: You once asked me why I think I'm always right, and I realized that you're right.
House : At least, I think you're right. I don't really know, now do I?
UNK: - Hey. I'm here. - Go home. Drink some hot tea.
House : Excellent counsel.
Cameron : Negative on parvovirus B-19.
UNK: I'm impressed. Thank you. I was born to run gels.
Foreman : I meant about Chase. What about Chase?
Foreman : Well, the man has no physical interest in you.
Foreman : He has a completely professional relationship with you, respects you as a colleague and a doctor.
Foreman : And yet, he can't look at you without thinking sex.
Cameron : Because I asked what kind of sex could kill you?
Foreman : You now have total control over your relationship with him.
Cameron : So, a woman can't express her interest in sex without it being some professional power play?
UNK: No. If you look the way you do and you say what you said,
House : you have to be aware of the effect that it's going to have on men.
UNK: Men should grow up. - Yeah, and dogs should stop licking themselves.
House : It's not gonna happen. What's going on?
Cameron : - Yeah, what are you doing here? - Looking for you guys.
Foreman : - Why didn't you page us? - 'Cause I knew you'd be here.
Chase : Who told him? No one.
House : I assume you're trying to prove my crazy, two-illness theory wrong, so, obviously, you're gonna be in the lab.
House : - You spin the urine? - Not yet.
House : Talk to me when you have.
UNK: What'd you find out? Kidney failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.
