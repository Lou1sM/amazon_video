Cuddy : You don't have any evidence.
Cuddy : And nobody knows anything, huh? Then how is it you always think you're right?
House : I don't. I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption.
House : And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?
Cuddy : Because I'm a doctor. Because when we make mistakes, people die.
UNK: Oh, come on.
House : People used to have more respect for cripples, you know.
House : They didn't really.
UNK: So how you feeling? Much better, thanks.
Rebecca : Are you Dr. House? I thought he was a he, but...
UNK: No.
Cuddy : Don't eat too much, too fast.
Rebecca : Thank him for me.
UNK: Right.
House : Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?
Cuddy : You got lucky.
House : Cool, huh?
UNK: Okay, once again.
UNK: Good.
Rebecca : Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?
Wilson : Well, you might run into him at the movies or on the bus.
Rebecca : Is he a good man?
Wilson : He's a good doctor.
Rebecca : Can you be one without the other?
Rebecca : Don't you have to care about people? Caring is a good motivator.
Wilson : He's found something else.
UNK: Feel this, both sides? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
UNK: Okay, squeeze. Harder. All right.
Rebecca : He's your friend, huh?
UNK: Yeah.
Rebecca : Does he care about you?
Wilson : I think so. You don't know?
Wilson : As Dr. House likes to say, "Everybody lies".
Rebecca : It's not what people say. It's what they do.
UNK: Yeah. He cares about me.
Rebecca : I can't see.
Rebecca : I can't... see.
Wilson : A little help in here!
Foreman : Your chest will be sore for a while.
Foreman : We needed to shock you to get your heart going.
UNK: Okay, can you arrange these to tell a story?
Foreman : She couldn't put them in order.
Chase : Could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?
UNK: No. I gave her the same test five minutes later. She did just fine.
Foreman : The altered mental status is intermittent, just like the verbal skills.
