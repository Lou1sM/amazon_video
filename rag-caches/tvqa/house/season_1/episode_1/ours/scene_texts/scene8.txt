House : I'm Dr. House.
Rebecca : It's good to meet you.
House : You're being an idiot.
House : You have a tapeworm in your brain.
House : It's not pleasant, but if we don't do anything, you'll be dead by the weekend.
Rebecca : Have you actually seen the worm?
House : When you're all better, I'll show you my diplomas.
Rebecca : You were sure I had vasculitis too.
Rebecca : Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a diaper.
UNK: What's this treatment gonna do for me?
House : I'm not talking about a treatment. I'm talking about a cure.
House : But because I might be wrong, you want to die.
Rebecca : What made you a cripple?
House : I had an infarction.
Rebecca : A heart attack?
House : It's what happens when blood flow is obstructed.
House : If it's in the heart, it's a heart attack. If it's in the lungs, it's a pulmonary embolism.
House : If it's in the brain, it's a stroke. I had it in my thigh muscles.
Rebecca : Wasn't there something they could do?
House : There was plenty they could do, if they'd made the right diagnosis.
House : But the only symptom was pain.
UNK: Not many people get to experience muscle death.
Rebecca : Did you think you were dying?
House : I hoped I was dying.
Rebecca : So you hide in your office, refuse to see patients...
Rebecca : because you don't like the way people look at you.
Rebecca : You feel cheated by life, so now you're gonna get even with the world.
UNK: But you want me to fight this.
UNK: Why?
Rebecca : What makes you think I'm so much better than you?
UNK: What, you're scared you'll turn into me?
Rebecca : I just want to die with a little dignity.
