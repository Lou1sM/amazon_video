Chase : He's stable, but comatose.
Foreman : Worse than before. He's on a ventilator.
House : Question is, why?
House : It's not his brain. It's not a toxin.
House : Our friend Babe helped with that one.
House : - So, what else? - Hep "C".
Chase : We never really treated it. We stopped the interferon when it started poisoning his liver.
UNK: Am I gonna have to write a song about it? His chronic hep "C"...
House : was not bad enough to produce these symptoms.
Foreman : - The estrogen level indicates it is. - It indicates something else entirely.
UNK: We can't give him interferon now. There are still traces of the lozenges in his system.
Cameron : It'll just poison him again. Genetics.
UNK: We don't treat the virus, we change it.
Chase : A nonnucleoside allosteric inhibitor.
Foreman : It's never been tried on a human being. It could kill him.
Chase : What's the difference? He's dead without it. - They're running a trial...
Foreman : on dogs at St. Sebastian's out in Philadelphia.
Foreman : I'll make the call.
House : What else could cause his estrogen level to be that high?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: We're gonna put the medicine in here.
Chase : Don't want it to burn his veins when it goes in.
UNK: And you have no idea if it'll work.
Chase : It's shown promise in testing.
UNK: Ma-Maybe there's nothing up there. I watched him like a hawk.
House : Pretty sure you didn't.
UNK: I... I didn't let him play with any more little toys.
House : Thus forcing him to shove a big one up there.
House : Stop, or I snap your nose off!
UNK: He... He's not too smart.
House : Genetics is a powerful force.
House : On the other hand, maybe he's smarter than you think.
UNK: What's goin' on? Just give me a second.
House : Always wanted to use one of these.
House : Tilt his head back. I... I don't know. I do...
House : Just tilt his head back.
House : Nice grasp of concepts. Relationships. Very smart.
House : Very cool.
UNK: First the policeman, the fireman, then the fire truck.
House : Your brother was sending in teams to save the cat.
UNK: Wow.
House : Sometimes the simplest answer...
