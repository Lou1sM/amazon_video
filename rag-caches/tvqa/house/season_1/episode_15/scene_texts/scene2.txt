House : What happened? Where is he?
Foreman : Vogler called Admitting. Admitting called Justice. Justice came and took him away.
House : And who called Vogler?
Vogler : He loses money.
Cuddy : So does Ophthalmology. Who cares? This is a hospital.
Cuddy : - You can't just cut a department. - You can't control him.
Cuddy : I am the only one that can control him.
UNK: Ã¢ÂÂª D-D-Dr. House in the house Ã¢ÂÂª
Vogler : Impeccable timing as always.
House : You had no authority to release my patient.
Vogler : My colleague has just informed me she has a singular talent.
Vogler : You are just in time for a demonstration.
Cuddy : Dr. House, from what I understand,
UNK: your patient... From what you understand... He's not your patient.
House : How the hell do you understand anything? It's sad.
UNK: You're not even a doctor. - John Smith is here only because of a court order.
Vogler : I had the records faxed to the judge. She rescinded the order.
House : - Why bother? Just to piss me off? - Keeping the government off our ass.
Vogler : Hmm. Yeah.
Vogler : That makes no sense for a public institution. - Okay.
Cuddy : - Okay, what? - Okay, sir.
House : Carry on.
Cuddy : He really cares about his patients.
Vogler : Yeah, and he just walked out of here with nothin'. Something's up.
Everhardt : Just started vomiting and passed out.
UNK: More lidocaine. 590, with epi.
UNK: Thirty-five-year-old male. Vital signs are stable now. Gave him two liters en route.
UNK: He was just released from here two hours ago.
UNK: You said he was good to go.
UNK: Watch that line. He's still not responding.
UNK: So, the junior G-man badge isn't looking so good.
Chase : - His liver's worse. - Comatose?
Cameron : No. Completely different symptoms than the first time.
UNK: His serology tests came back positive for hepatitis "C".
UNK: Hep "C" is a chronic condition. You don't think this is an acute situation?
Chase : Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain. Hep "C" explains everything.
House : - Except for the suddenness of the onset. - What's wrong with the timing?
House : You get home one night, your wife hits you with a baseball bat.
