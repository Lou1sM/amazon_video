UNK: If it's the O.T.D... - If it's the O.T.D.? What if House is wrong, huh?
Foreman : That severe a reaction, it'll take some time...
UNK: He makes these assumptions about people, talks you into things... - Mr. Arnello...
Joey : He's awake. He wants to see you.
Vogler : You look like crap.
Joey : That's a joke. See? I'm sick. I said you look like crap.
Vogler : You have no idea what I just went through out there.
UNK: You kept gettin' worse.
UNK: And Dr. House kept sayin' all this crap.
UNK: You know, if... if I think you're normal, then he's gonna keep giving you the medicine.
Bill : - If you weren't... - Weren't what?
UNK: Normal?
UNK: Yeah.
Bill : He said you were a fag.
Bill : Witness Protection... That's your big chance to be one.
Joey : - You believed him? - I don't know what to believe.
Bill : You were sick.
Bill : I had to make a decision. I thought you were gonna die.
Joey : You believed him.
Joey : He stopped the medicine.
House : Here I am.
Joey : - I wanted to talk to you about this. - There's nothin' to talk about.
Bill : You, uh,
Bill : ordered some Chinese Internet health crap,
UNK: and they sent the wrong pills, and you took 'em.
Joey : Yeah, yeah. That, uh...
Joey : That must be it.
UNK: You wanna testify?
Bill : Go ahead.
Bill : I told the doc. He said it's okay.
Joey : - I don't expect you to understand. - I don't.
Bill : All I need to know is you're my brother, Joey.
Bill : If you think this...
Bill : thing, whatever, is gonna make you happy,
UNK: then I think you should do it.
Wilson : You should.
Cuddy : Vogler wants to fire you.
Cuddy : Lose the whole department.
House : Good thing you fought for me though, right?
House : Dress was a nice move, but you gotta follow it up.
House : Nasty weekend in Vegas.
House : Something that shows off your real administrative skills.
Cuddy : He threatened to fire me.
House : I'm sorry.
UNK: So, how long do I have? I've got a lot of personal stuff to pack up.
UNK: And I assume you're gonna want to throw a party.
Cuddy : I told him I know where the bodies are buried.
Cuddy : The stuff he needs to know that's not in the books. I told him he can't ditch me.
House : He's only keeping you on because you know the secret handshakes.
House : He's a quick study. Six months, he'll have the moves down. He won't need you anymore.
Cuddy : - I'll deal with that then. - So I stay.
UNK: Yes.
Cuddy : But some things are going to change.
House : Profits. New world order.
House : Everything's about profits. Yeah, that's real new.
Wilson : You could rent out the Corvette every once in a while or lend it to a friend.
House : That would be easy, and it would be wrong.
Wilson : But Cuddy stood up for you.
House : To a point.
Wilson : To what point?
House : I gotta do six more clinic hours a month. So do two of them.
Wilson : Why only two?
House : 'Cause one of them's gone.
House : I gotta fire somebody.
House : Good morning.
