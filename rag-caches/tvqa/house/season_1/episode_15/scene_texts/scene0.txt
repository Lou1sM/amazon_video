Cuddy : Don't have it.
UNK: Budget? Nope.
Vogler : Revenue statement. List of expenses.
Cuddy : House has been very busy.
Vogler : Saving New Jersey from leprosy. Yes, I know.
Vogler : Getting me his numbers, that's your job.
Cuddy : - We're in a meeting. - I need the lawyer.
Vogler : Who'd you kill? Nobody. But it's not even lunch.
UNK: I got served with a federal court order. Some witness went into a coma.
UNK: They want me to take a look at him.
UNK: What?
Vogler : They want you to examine a sick person?
Vogler : This is a public relations nightmare.
UNK: Folk think our staff do that kind of thing around here,
UNK: this place will be crawling with sick people.
House : I'm a doctor. I'm not a lapdog for the feds. I don't play fetch.
Vogler : Nobody tells you what to do. Am I right, Dr. Cuddy?
UNK: You have three choices. Hire a lawyer to fight the order, treat the guy or go to jail for contempt.
UNK: Up to you.
House : Jail. You'd like that. No more naughty schoolgirl.
House : Conjugal visit... that's her new fantasy.
Vogler : We're not leaving until he's gone, or you show me...
Vogler : one good reason for keeping him.
House : He's really out of it, huh?
UNK: Causes of coma... metabolic, structural... He had his stomach pumped.
Chase : Why would they do that? Rule out poisoning.
UNK: Huh. Not the typical first guess.
UNK: Nope, first guess was faking it. The patient's a federal witness... reluctant, I'm assuming.
UNK: He's also an eight on the Glasgow Coma Scale.
UNK: He's barely alive. Pretty tough to fake.
Cameron : Any recent history of head trauma? Bad car accident? Fall?
House : They tell me no, but do an M.R.I. to be sure.
Chase : Metabolic causes... Liver, kidney, diabetes...
House : Check for everything. Feds are paying.
House : We're gonna turn a profit on this one, boys.
Bill : Dr. House, Bill Arnello. I'm a lawyer.
Bill : I represent Mr. Smith. What's wrong with him?
House : Do I come to you with my problems?
Bill : He's also my brother.
House : What? You changed your name?
UNK: Smith wasn't good enough for you?
Bill : His name's Joey. He's my only brother. He's important to you.
House : Got it. So, no placebos for him. We'll use the real medicine.
House : This was fun. Let's do it again soon.
House : Brother in the Mafia?
House : So, just joey?
House : I was hoping for a nickname.
House : Joey Mango. Joey the Wrench.
House : People know where I am. I want you to do your job.
Bill : Diagnose him, fix him and keep him here.
House : We're a bit of a specialized hospital. We generally only deal with patients while they're actually sick.
Bill : If you release my brother to the government,
Bill : and he does what they want, even if you fix him, he's dead.
Bill : I need time to convince him of that.
Bill : Good news is, if you screw up,
Bill : you don't have to worry about a malpractice suit.
UNK: Instead, one by one,
Bill : I'll take away the things you love till there's nothing left.
House : So, on the Mafia thing,
House : that's a yes.
Cameron : Did House seem weird to you?
Chase : Were you expecting him to be weird?
