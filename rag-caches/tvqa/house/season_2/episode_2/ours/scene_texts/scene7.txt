UNK: - I'm Dr. House. - I've seen you around.
House : Your mom tell you what we're gonna try?
Foreman : Sort of.
House : Tomorrow's test could take 10 hours.
UNK: Given your present condition, you might not even make it through.
Andie : - My mom's done a lot of research. - How do you feel about it?
House : If we figured maturity came from how much time you've got left
UNK: instead of how long you've been here, this would be your call.
Andie : I don't have a choice, right?
House : I could give you one.
Andie : I wanna get better.
House : You've got cancer.
UNK: - If I fix this... - I have a year.
House : A year of this.
House : A lot of people wouldn't want that.
House : A lot of people would just want it to be over.
UNK: Are you asking if I wanna die?
House : Nobody wants to die.
House : But you're going to.
House : The question is, how? How much you're gonna suffer, and
House : how long.
House : I'm asking if you want this to be over.
Andie : What would you tell my mom?
UNK: I would give her 10 excellent medical reasons
House : why we can't do this procedure.
Andie : I can't just leave her 'cause I'm tired.
House : But you can't stay for her, either.
Andie : But she needs me here.
House : This is your life.
House : You can't do this just for her.
Andie : I love her.
House : Thank you for joining me for tonight's dress rehearsal.
