Cuddy : - House. - We tested the wrong water.
House : He stole cable, he stole fertilizer and he stole water.
House : - It's riddled with Naegleria. - I know.
House : You already did the biopsy.
Cameron : I thought I had no choice.
Rodney : How's my son?
Cameron : He has primary amoebic meningoencephalitis.
Cameron : It's a parasite that goes through the nose
Cameron : and migrates into the brain, where it feeds on brain cells.
Cameron : The Legionella attacked the parasite. That's why the disease slowed down.
Rodney : - Is it treatable? - We started him on an antiparasitic
Cameron : and the amoebas will clear out of his system.
UNK: And he'll be OK?
Cameron : Then we'll wean him out of the coma...
Rodney : Will he be OK?
Cameron : There'll be no lasting damage from the parasite.
Rodney : But the surgery?
Cameron : We don't know.
UNK: Up and at 'em.
UNK: How you feeling?
Cameron : Can you talk?
Foreman : I don't feel anything.
Rodney : Are you numb?
Foreman : No, I mean...
Foreman : I don't feel any pain.
UNK: Keep your head still. Follow my finger.
Foreman : - I'm OK. - Your breath stinks,
UNK: and you're peeing into a bag. What are our names?
Foreman : You did the biopsy?
Girl : - Thank you. - Names?
UNK: Cameron.
Foreman : My dad
Foreman : and the manipulative bastard.
House : You remembered.
UNK: - How you doing, Dad? - Great.
Rodney : Relieved. Great.
Foreman : What did I have?
Cameron : Naegleria. Biopsy showed the amoeba,
UNK: the CDC autopsy eventually found the amoeba,
Cameron : and House found it in the water on the cop's roof.
House : - Wiggle your left toes. - Wait. What?
Foreman : - You went back and she did the biopsy? - Your left toes, Foreman.
Foreman : I just did.
House : No, you didn't.
Rodney : - He can't move his toes. - He can move them.
House : Raise your right arm.
UNK: What?
