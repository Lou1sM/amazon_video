Patient : I think I broke my ankle.
Patient : I was kicked. By a hoof.
Patient : I'm so in love. She was so beautiful.
House : Which one? One of the black and white ones,
Patient : - I'm not sure what type... - Not which type, which one?
House : I want a name.
Patient : - Why would it have a name? - Not "it." "She." Or "he."
House : I wanna know her dreams, her hopes.
Patient : It's a cow.
House : Hey, I'm not the one who said he was in love.
House : People who actually have this condition rationalize it.
House : They dismiss it, they don't elevate it to the level of poetry.
House : Plus there's a wooden splinter in there.
House : So, either you hit yourself with a two-by-four,
UNK: or Elsie has a peg leg.
UNK: I'm off duty at 6 : 00.
House : Give yourself another whack, come back and scam somebody else.
Patient : I'm sick! And you're a doctor, you have a duty to help me.
UNK: Technically, I don't have to treat anybody
House : before running a series of painful and often humiliating tests.
Patient : Whatever you need.
UNK: 90-year-old woman died of pneumonia.
House : Unless she has a bionic heart, what's next?
Cameron : Baby died in the ICU...
House : Babies are useless. They got hearts the size of ping-pong balls. Next.
UNK: A 40-year-old male.
Simpson : - Yes? - Heart attack.
House : If you really cared about me, you'd find me a better corpse.
UNK: There's no other deaths. There's one woman who was in a car accident.
House : Bad one, I hope.
UNK: The organ procurement people have been notified.
House : Give me her file.
Cameron : It's in the ER, they're still working on her.
UNK: Age? About 40.
House : Young, damn.
Cameron : Young is good.
UNK: Smoker? Don't know.
House : - Find out. - She's still alive.
Cameron : Even if we get on the list, we can't go near her...
UNK: Overweight?
Cameron : She's on the hefty side.
House : Excellent. Our odds just went up.
Cameron : What odds? What is this?
House : 60% of potential donor hearts get tossed in the trash
House : because there's something wrong with them.
House : With fat people, it's closer to 80.
Cameron : But if her heart's no good, then...
House : Big fat, sloppy heart beats no heart at all.
House : - Are you Mr. Neuberger? - Yes.
UNK: I'm Dr. House. I need to ask you a few questions about your wife.
UNK: Is she gonna be okay?
House : I'm afraid I don't know that.
House : Could you tell me about her accident?
Donald : They think she fell asleep, went off the road. That's all they told me.
House : Any problems with her health up until now?
UNK: Why?
UNK: Please, it's important.
Donald : She had a fever today, but otherwise she was...
House : - How high? - About 101.
Donald : She hasn't missed a day of teaching in years.
UNK: And I should've made her stay home.
House : Any other symptoms?
Donald : A stomachache. Who cares? She was in a car crash!
UNK: - Mr. Neuberger? Yeah? - My name's Ellen Stambler.
Woman : I'm the organ procurement coordinator for southern New Jersey.
Woman : I just want to assure you that we'll treat her organs with care and dignity.
Woman : Her organs?
Donald : Laura died?
Ellen : I'm sorry, I thought...
Ellen : She was just pronounced dead.
