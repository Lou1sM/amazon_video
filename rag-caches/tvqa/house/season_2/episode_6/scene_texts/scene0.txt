UNK: Yeah!
Stacy : We need to talk.
UNK: Oh, God. Are you pregnant? 'Cause I really wanna finish high school.
Stacy : You have to renew your credential.
House : They're good for two more months.
UNK: Three weeks. And the paperwork takes forever.
Stacy : Your application, your malpractice insurance,
UNK: criminal records check and you know that's gonna take some explaining.
UNK: You know, our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together.
UNK: Why did we stop doing that? Did you get married?
Stacy : Yeah. Otherwise I'd be on you like red on rice.
UNK: Look, rice isn't... Oh, I get it.
Stacy : You're also behind on your dictations.
House : I don't do dictations.
House : Cameron does them, or somebody.
UNK: And you can't have your sole female employee
Stacy : doing your clerical work, which you'd know if you'd attended
Stacy : the required sexual harassment seminars.
UNK: Now, I'm gonna pause so you can make a crack about harassment.
House : Joke killer.
Cuddy : House, got a patient.
House : Sorry. Can't play anymore. My mom's calling me.
Cuddy : We just admitted a world-class cyclist.
UNK: - You gotta fire Stacy. - Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Cuddy : Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest at 30 miles per hour.
House : She's loading me up with pointless paperwork.
UNK: Well, you're way behind on your pointless paperwork.
UNK: - O2 sats are in the... - She's hostile.
House : You know me, hostility makes me shrink up like a...
UNK: I can't think of a non-sexual metaphor.
UNK: She's gonna stand over my desk with a ruler, checking my spelling...
Cuddy : ER checked for lung infiltrates. Nothing there.
House : Professional athletes, Cuddy. It's like watching an old movie at 2 a.m.
House : Reliving all the classic moments.
UNK: The part where he denies it's drugs.
UNK: The part where the good guys ride in, tests a-blazing,
House : prove that it is drugs.
House : Oscar clip. He can't imagine how they got into his body.
UNK: It's so familiar, so comforting.
House : She can't handle working with me.
Cuddy : Oh, right. Yeah.
Cuddy : She's still got a thing for you, making it impossible for her to deal.
UNK: It makes perfect sense, except for the pronouns.
House : Anyway, thanks for getting me out of that meeting.
Cuddy : He's not denying the drugs.
Cuddy : I'm thinking he's actually sick.
Cuddy : Jeff Forster, this is...
House : I'm a doctor. You're a sick person.
House : And you are a loved one. Actually, manager.
UNK: We've been together for 7 years.
UNK: So what's the drug I'd jour on the bike circuit these days?
House : Still erythropoietin, or are you guys just chugging battery acid?
Jeff : There's no way I'd touch EPO. Too many guys stroking out and dying.
UNK: Damn.
UNK: 10 bucks for the ticket, six for the popcorn.
Jeff : I do straight blood doping.
Cuddy : Plot twist.
