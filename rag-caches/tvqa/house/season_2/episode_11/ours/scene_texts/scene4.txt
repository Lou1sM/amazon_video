UNK: House [to Parents.] : Are you always such a good little girl,
UNK: House [to Parents.] : or does Mommy sometimes say you're the reason she needs a double martini?
Margo : Who are you?
UNK: House [to Stella.] : Over here, kiddo. I'm talking to you. Focus.
UNK: House [to Stella.] : Must be because you're off your meds.
Margo : Who are you?
UNK: - Doctor and candy striper. - She's not on any medication.
House : Well, that's strange.
UNK: 'Cause this bottle has her name on it. And I think these are medical pills inside.
Ted : What's he talking about?
UNK: The doctor prescribed Stella...
Margo : A few months ago.
Margo : I never told you about it, because I never gave her any.
House : That's funny, 'cause the bottle's almost empty.
House : You missed a couple of days. Take five.
Foreman : - Stop. - Why? Unless they're not hers.
House : You need some water, sweetie?
Margo : I'm not taking Ritalin.
House : Come on. All the cool moms are doing it.
House : And tox screen says you're cool, too.
Ted : You were on drugs while taking care of Stella?
Margo : I'm sorry, Ted.
Margo : It's a cafeteria menu.
UNK: It should take a couple hours to process her.
UNK: House [to Ted.] : Then you can take her home and divorce her.
House : Working late?
House : Or are you just avoiding Mark?
Stacy : It was one kiss, Greg.
UNK: So far. I'm planning on keeping a chart.
Stacy : I'm moving back to Short Hills. I think it's time.
House : You're leaving?
UNK: It was never meant to be permanent, and now that Mark's getting better...
House : Yeah, much better.
House : Except for the whole walking thing.
Stacy : He needs to get back to work.
UNK: Right.
House : Saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream.
House : You're running away because the kiss meant something.
Stacy : I'm not running away. I'm going home.
House : With Mark.
Stacy : I love Mark.
UNK: House [comes Around Desk.] : You love me more.
UNK: House [comes Around Desk.] : I don't want you to leave.
UNK: Margo [to Ted.] : Are we okay?
House : I'm sorry.
Ted : Let's just get you home.
UNK: Margo [nods.] : That's a good idea.
Daughter : - Mommy! - Hey!
UNK: - Call a code! - What's wrong, Mommy?
Ted : What's going on?
