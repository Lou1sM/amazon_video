House : What are you doing here?
Stella : Ted's with my mom. He asked the nurse to watch me.
House : What nurse?
Stella : She's not really watching me.
UNK: House [nods.] : I got that.
Stella : Do you still have the balloons?
UNK: No.

Stella : When can Mommy come home?
UNK: Stacy [emphatically.] : Don't know.
Stella : - What's wrong with your foot? - War wound.
Stella : - Does it hurt? - Every day.
Stella : Is that why you're so sad?
UNK: House [looking Down At Her.] : Oh, aren't you adorable?
UNK: House [looking Down At Her.] : I'm not sad, I'm complicated. Chicks dig that.
UNK: House [looking Down At Her.] : One day you'll understand.
Stella : That's what my parents say when they don't want me to know something.
House : They say that a lot?
Stella : Only when they're talking about making babies and stuff.
UNK: House [nods.] : When you catch them fighting?
Stella : - They don't fight. - Not ever?

Chase : With what? I hadn't even started the procedure.
Stacy : I need some advice.
Cuddy : - Whatever it is, can it wait? - Yeah.
UNK: Stacy [turns To Go.] : What was Greg like after I left?
Cuddy : An egomaniacal narcissistic pain in the ass.
Cuddy : Same as before you left.
Stacy : Do you think he's capable of having a real relationship?
Cuddy : - What happened in Baltimore? - Nothing.
Ted : - Right. - Maybe something.
UNK: Right.
Stacy : Technically, most of the something happened after Baltimore.
Cuddy : Oh, God, Stacy.
Stacy : I don't know what to do.
Cuddy : Are you seriously thinking about leaving Mark?
Stacy : No. I don't know.
Stacy : I can't.
Cuddy : And you want me to tell you it's okay?
Stacy : It wasn't all bad with Greg. I was with him for a reason.
Cuddy : You left him for a reason.
Stacy : I could swear I remember him being fun.
UNK: Chase [to Ted & Stella.] : Sorry for the scare.
Ted : Just tell me she's okay.
Chase : Ultrasound showed the bleed was coming from her liver.
Chase : It's rare, but the blood got into her fallopian tubes.
Chase : In a way, it was lucky. Let us know we were looking in the wrong place.
Chase : The tumor's in her liver.
Ted : Is it cancer?
Chase : We're running some more tests.

Foreman : It's a liver tumor.
