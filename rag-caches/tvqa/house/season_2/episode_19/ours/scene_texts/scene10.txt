Wilson : God said no medicine, no procedures.
Wilson : Taking off your clothes doesn't count as either of those.
Wilson : This one's your call.
UNK: Son...
Boyd : - Dad, you have to have faith in me. - I have faith in the Lord.
Dad : You, I trust, as much as you can trust a teenage boy.
Dad : Take off your clothes.
UNK: Relax.
House : A few Hail Marys, a little acyclovir,
UNK: you'll be picking up angels again in no time.
House : Come in.
Boyd : My father told me I have to apologize to you.
UNK: You still hearing the voices?
Boyd : You're lucky.
Boyd : You go through life with a certainty that what you're doing is right.
Boyd : I know how comforting that is.
Boyd : Good luck.
UNK: You're not gonna give me my final point?
Chase : You knew it was me?
House : Who else?
House : You don't think God should get a point knocked off?
Chase : - The tumor shrank. - Because of a virus.
Chase : Do you know what the odds are?
Chase : She had to have the right type of cancer,
Chase : he had to have the right type of virus.
Chase : - The exposure... - She won the lottery.
UNK: You say "won the lottery", he says "miracle".
House : Yeah, the hand of God reached into this kid's pants, made him have sex
UNK: so he could scratch a rash and stick his fingers in some woman's face,
House : give her a few extra months.
House : Come on, he's just another liar and manipulator.
Wilson : Well, nobody's as perfect as you are.
Wilson : It is possible to believe in something and still fail to live up to it.
House : So, how's your girlfriend?
Wilson : She got a little extra time out of this. Not a lot.
House : She didn't crash.
UNK: No. She says she's happier when she believes in something
Wilson : bigger than she is.
House : She still believes.
Wilson : Faith. She's going to Florence.
UNK: You moving out?
UNK: Yeah.
House : Moving back in with me?
Wilson : I don't think that's a great idea.
House : But we're OK?
Wilson : House, you are...
Wilson : as God made you.
