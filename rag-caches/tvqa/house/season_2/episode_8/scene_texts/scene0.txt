Cuddy : - Hey. - Hey.
Cuddy : You speak to Chase and House yet? The disciplinary hearing.
Stacy : The McGinley case, that's not for two weeks.
UNK: Tomorrow.
Cuddy : Scheduling disaster, you don't wanna hear it.
Cuddy : You gotta get the boys' okay to move the hearing up,
Cuddy : and you gotta do that whole legal advice thing.
Stacy : - Can you ask someone else? - I'm asking you.
Stacy : Let me work with Chase. House should have separate counsel.
Cuddy : Stop looking for whatever you're looking for.
Cuddy : For the last month, House has been crowing
Cuddy : that you can't work with him because you're just swooning in love.
Stacy : There is nothing approaching love in what I feel about him right now.
Cuddy : Well, if you can't work with him, it amounts to the same thing.
Stacy : We had a fight. It's awkward. Why not use another lawyer?
Cuddy : Because 40% of our lawsuits last year were about House.
Cuddy : If you can't work with him, you can't work here.
