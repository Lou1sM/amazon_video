House : - unless you let me find the tick. - Could he be right?
Cuddy : The only thing I know for sure is that your daughter's heart won't last
Cuddy : another 20 minutes without treatment.
UNK: Okay, I just need one final instruction. When I find the tick on the autopsy,
House : do you want to know? I'm thinking not, probably make the coping easier.
Cuddy : Stop talking to them!
Cuddy : Page Borsisky in cardiology. Get her team down here stat.
Cuddy : Get them out of here. Get House out, too.
Cuddy : Dr. Wilson, I could use your help.
Wilson : Well, I don't know if the dopamine's enough. She may need inamrinone lactate.
UNK: Why? What's that? She doesn't...
UNK: She might need stronger pressors. They don't have any in radiology.
Cuddy : Inamrinone can cause arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.
Wilson : Not inamrinone could cause death. Death's worse.
Wilson : We have to get her up to the ICU.
