Melinda : Why do these things keep happening to me?
Lewis : Dan's back.
UNK: Hey, baby, did you hear that? Dan's here.
UNK: I don't wanna see him.
Barbara : - I'll tell him to come back later. - No.
Melinda : Mommy, stay here, please.
Barbara : Of course.
UNK: - Is she doing okay? - She's sleeping.
Foreman : I'm sure she's exhausted.
Foreman : Mood swings are common with the anti-rejection meds.
Barbara : No. She's had mood swings. This isn't it.
Barbara : This is... She's given up.
Barbara : I know you think I'm...
Barbara : This isn't what I wanted.
Barbara : She's always fought with me.
Barbara : Ever since she was a baby, she was so damn stubborn.
Barbara : But I never wanted her like this.
Barbara : I just wanted her safe.
UNK: Doctor!
Lewis : She can't breathe. She can't even get a whole sentence out.
UNK: She's using the accessory muscles.
UNK: - O2 sat's down to 90. Lungs clear? - Yeah.
Chase : Does your tongue feel swollen? Is it itchy?
Foreman : - No hives. - It's not an allergy.
Foreman : Lips are cyanotic. We've got to intubate.
House : What are you doing?
Chase : Pushing lorazepam.
Foreman : She's not getting enough oxygen. We've gotta assist her breathing.
Barbara : What was that? Was that a reaction to the treatment?
Foreman : It's the paralysis. It's reached her lungs.
Chase : Melinda's dying.
House : We're all dying. How fast?
UNK: Too fast for Guillain BarrÃÂ©.
Chase : Cuddy wants to get her an MRI to rule out a spinal lesion.
House : Cuddy? What's she doing on this?
Foreman : The family lost confidence in us.
House : I don't blame them. I'll be right in.
Foreman : It's like she got poisoned with a nerve agent.
Cameron : Glue inhalation. Would explain why she hasn't admitted it.
Foreman : Tox screen was clear for pot.
UNK: Middle-class heart transplant patient's gonna huff glue?
Chase : - Pesticides? - They're not spraying.
House : This girl's tough. She gets what she wants.
House : She's deprived of human contact. She gets herself a backdoor man.
UNK: Or in her case, a side-window boy. What else has she been deprived of?
Cameron : She's on a special diet because of her allergies.
House : The boyfriend brings the hot beef. He also brings a side dish, botulism.
Foreman : This paralysis is ascending, remember?
UNK: Not if the heart problem's really a paralytic problem.
Cameron : Why would she admit the sex and not the food?
Chase : She didn't admit anything.
Chase : He admitted the sex, and we didn't ask him about food.
House : - Get me a rat. - You have a rat.
UNK: What? I'm not gonna kill Steve.
House : Only way to confirm this, inject a rat with her blood
