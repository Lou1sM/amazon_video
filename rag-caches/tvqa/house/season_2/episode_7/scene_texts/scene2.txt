Chase : Does anyone actually fall for that line?
Kalvin : Every day.
Kalvin : Why do you think I became a photographer?
Kalvin : I'm guessing you guys didn't think about dating on career day.
Cameron : - I love my job. - Really?
UNK: You seem more the "find it exceptionally satisfying" type.
Cameron : I'm not sure there's a difference.
Cameron : Your mom died of diabetes. How's your dad's health?
Kalvin : Last I heard, he had cirrhosis.
Kalvin : Love is love. Satisfying is "social validation, fun can wait."
Cameron : I have fun.
Chase : Yeah, she's got some scheduled for February.
Chase : Last you heard, your father?
Kalvin : He threw me out when I was 16. It's just as well.
Kalvin : I got tired of getting BB guns for my birthday when I'd asked for a Barbie.
Chase : Dads can be real sweethearts.
Kalvin : Sensitive and cute.
Cameron : He's cute.
UNK: He ran into that heating vent, right there.
UNK: Hopefully, Mark's anger will go away eventually.
UNK: He's not angry, he just doesn't like you. Nothing unique there.
UNK: Didn't seem real wild about you, either.
Stacy : He's fine with me.
House : He's angry. Said so in group.
UNK: Of course he's angry. He's looking at months of painful physio.
House : - He's mad at you. - There's no way he said that.
House : No. But it's true.
House : He resents you for being able to walk.
House : Been there.
UNK: I resented you for a hell of a long time.
Stacy : Past tense?
Stacy : Might be the hospital.
UNK: What?
Foreman : Bad time? Where are you?
House : At your girlfriend's place. Ignore the moaning and squeaking.
Chase : His lungs are too scarred to tell which infection triggered
Chase : the immune reconstitution.
House : He a smoker?
Cameron : Yes, and possibly more than cigarettes.
Cameron : His tox screen came back positive for recreational drugs.
House : Not surprising, not medically relevant.
Foreman : His heart looks a little enlarged.
UNK: That's a typical side effect of AZT.
House : What are Kalvin's most recent infections?
Chase : Toxo, CMV,
Chase : and PCP.
House : Well, let's assume it's one of those.
House : Give him ganciclovir for the CMV.
Foreman : We can hardly hear you. Where are you?
House : In a closet.
House : Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up.
House : Ganciclovir for the CMV.
House : Sulfadiazine for the toxo, Bactrim for PCP.
House : Gotta go. It's killing time.
Cameron : Your tox screen came back positive for...
UNK: Crystal meth and ecstasy.
Cameron : Recreational drugs are dangerous to begin with, but for someone with HIV...
Kalvin : I didn't mistake them for vitamins. I'm a PNP boy.
Kalvin : Party and Play. Drugs and sex.
Kalvin : You don't approve?
Cameron : Does the sex include condoms?
Kalvin : If he's negative, sure. If he's positive...
Kalvin : Why put on a raincoat if you're already wet?
Cameron : You could get hepatitis, or another strain of HIV.
Kalvin : Or I could get hit by a bus.
Cameron : - AIDS isn't a death sentence anymore. - I don't wanna have any regrets.
Cameron : How long have you been coughing?
Kalvin : About an hour or so.
Cameron : Try to take a deep breath.
Cameron : - What is it? - I think it's blood.
Doctor : I recommend post-exposure prophylaxis.
Doctor : Your chances of conversion are slim,
Doctor : but I'd like to put you on three anti-viral medications.
UNK: Nelfinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine.
UNK: There are side effects, headache, nausea, vivid dreaming.
UNK: You'll be tested for HIV at six weeks, three months, six months.
House : Very interesting.
Foreman : He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth, that's interesting?
