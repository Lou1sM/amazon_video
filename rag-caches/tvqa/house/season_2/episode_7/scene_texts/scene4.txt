Kalvin : I'm sorry. About what happened.
Cameron : It's best not to talk. You're gonna feel a sharp pinch.
UNK: This actually is gonna grab a piece of your lung.
Kalvin : What were you guys looking for at my hotel?
UNK: Your drugs. We thought maybe you'd used toxic meth.
Cameron : We'll know if you were exposed to beryllium in a few hours.
Kalvin : Well, if you're still curious, it's in my bag over there on the chair.
Cameron : You brought drugs into the hospital? Glad I wasted my time at your hotel.
Kalvin : I told you I used, you didn't ask me for a sample.
Kalvin : You're not pissed about this,
Kalvin : you're mad because I coughed blood on you.
Cameron : - That was an accident. - Would you stop being nice?
Kalvin : It's useless, and worse, it's boring. Get angry!
Kalvin : I had one stupid night, I end up with HIV.
Kalvin : Do you have any idea how pissed off I was?
Cameron : This wasn't your fault.
Stacy : - You broke into my house? - Well, I had to, Mark isn't here.
Stacy : - He has physio. - Oh, really?
House : - How's he doing? - What happened with all the cheese?
UNK: Well, I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen ate any Coumadin.
House : I named your rat.
House : Steve's tilting his head.
House : Any neurologist will tell you
House : that suggests an infection or a brain-stem tumor.
Stacy : - Death cures both those things. - We can't kill him.
House : If it's an infection, it could be caused by something in your house.
House : Something that could affect you guys.
House : Smell this.
House : Does it smell like urine?
House : You missing any asparagus?
UNK: Okay, stuff these. If he doesn't get better, then it's a tumor.
Stacy : Then what, chemo?
House : Steve McQueen without hair?
House : It's a blessing he died young.
UNK: Hello.
Stacy : Hi, honey.
Stacy : I'm sorry I missed you, yeah. I came home.
UNK: All right, I'll see you in a few minutes.
Stacy : Okay. Bye, hon.
Kalvin : Chest hurts.
UNK: Heart rate's a 100 and climbing, could be an allergic reaction.
UNK: Neck veins are up. Must be pericardial effusion.
UNK: There's no wheezing.
UNK: The tear in his lungs must have reopened.
Cameron : Kalvin? You're bleeding into the area around your heart.
Kalvin : - I can't breathe. - The blood's crushing your heart.
Cameron : - Once we remove it, you'll be fine. - If I die, please tell my dad...
Cameron : - You're not going to die. - Tell him sorry.
Cameron : Where's the blood?
Cameron : It's clear.
Foreman : Only one other thing could cause this. A tumor in his heart.
Wilson : CT confirmed a mass in Kalvin's heart, and several smaller ones in his lungs.
