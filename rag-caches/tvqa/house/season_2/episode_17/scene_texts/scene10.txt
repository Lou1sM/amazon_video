UNK: I totally played this guy, Berman, from business affairs.
Wilson : I got great cards. But I don't bet. Just call, no raises.
UNK: Berman pairs his king on the flop.
Wilson : I keep calling, the river turns,
Wilson : I check. He can't stand it.
Wilson : He goes all in. He's sure he's won.
UNK: I call, I flip them.
House : Pocket aces.
Wilson : I nailed his ass.
House : The aces were hiding all along.
House : Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.
UNK: Erdheim-Chester? That's not even on the list.
Chase : Because we already did it. He tested negative.
UNK: - So did Ester. - The disease lied.
Cameron : Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you. Diseases don't lie.
House : Fine, it didn't lie. It slow played us.
House : We biopsied the colon, it hadn't reached the GI tract yet.
House : It's there now. It's in his liver, his lungs.
Chase : You want it to be there.
Chase : Because then you didn't screw up 12 years ago.
Foreman : We can't waste our one test on the one disease we know it's not.
House : Run the test.
Chase : You sure about this?
House : Wait. Let me think about that. Don't pressure me.
House : Just run the damn test.
Cameron : Cells look like macrophages.
House : That's a good start.
House : Take your time, and say it loud.
Foreman : CD 68 positive.
House : Start the treatment.
UNK: So, Ester can rest peaceful now, huh?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: $40.
Wilson : You got lucky.
Cuddy : You gonna call?
House : What I do
House : is not just based on the flip of a card.
Wilson : You guessed. You got lucky.
House : It fit.
Wilson : It could just as easily have been sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.
House : No, not just as easily.
Wilson : Maybe not. But it wasn't impossible.
UNK: Are you gonna call?
House : You know, relative to its size,
House : the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal.
