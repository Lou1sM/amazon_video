Foreman : He's back.
Chase : - What are you doing? - I'm doing what we came here to do.
Chase : - It almost killed him. - I know. I was right here.
UNK: I need a Vacutainer.
UNK: His brain's been oxygen deprived for over eight minutes.
Chase : There might be nothing left. He might...
House : Tell the parents. Where the hell is that Vacutainer?
House : - So, what's he got? - Brain damage.
House : Good chance. I was talking about before that.
Cameron : - You're not worried about... - Things I can't do anything about?
House : - I try not to. - Yeah.
Foreman : Things just roll off you like water off a duck.
UNK: Histiocytosis.
UNK: Very unlikely in a 73-year-old.
UNK: Whatever this is, it's very unlikely.
House : Come on. More ideas. Let's go, people.
Cameron : Genetic disorders could cause masses everywhere. Tuberous sclerosis.
Foreman : If it's genetic, he's had it all his life.
Foreman : - Why now? - I don't know.
House : It sure fits nice enough.
Chase : We haven't ruled out leukemia yet.
Cameron : Or sarcoma. He could have multiple soft tissue tumors.
Foreman : Or sarcoidosis.
Cameron : Multiple neurofibromatosis.
UNK: Chondrocytomas.
House : How's it going? You win?
Cuddy : I got called away by the angry parents of a patient.
Cuddy : There are three of you here.
Cuddy : None of you had the sense to stop him, to pick up a phone and call me.
House : I told them you'd signed off.
House : The parents are mad because their kid is dying.
UNK: It's understandable.
House : But if he doesn't die, they won't be mad anymore.
UNK: If he's brain damaged, they might still be a little ticked.
House : Had to do it to save him.
UNK: You had to do it to diagnose Ester.
UNK: You may have killed a six-year-old
Cuddy : because you're obsessed with a woman who's been dead for 12 years.
Cuddy : Sometimes you lose, House! You're not God!
House : He's not dead yet.
Cuddy : No, but you're done with him.
Cuddy : It's my case now. Go home. Go ride your motorcycle.
Cuddy : Go brood in a dark room. Just don't go near Ian again.
House : So, anything else or is it just these seven?
Foreman : Drop it, House. She's right.
House : No, she's not!
House : - You know she's not. - We should have called her.
House : I'm surprised you didn't.
UNK: You're gonna have to find a way to let this go.
Cameron : We can't go near Ian.
House : We don't need to go near him.
House : We have his tumor.
UNK: Well, Cuddy may be right that we screwed up the protocol.
House : She may be right about my screwed up obsession.
House : But I'm right about the medicine.
House : How many tests can we do with that?
House : Look, we cure the kid, we solve everybody's problems.
House : How many?
Cameron : Maybe two good pieces.
House : How many okay pieces?
Cameron : Three would be pushing it.
House : Three tests, seven choices.
House : Okay, what's first?
