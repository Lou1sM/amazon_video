Sarah : Why are you taking a picture of his head?
Cameron : We're looking for lymphoma, but...
UNK: So, it's not Erdheim-something and it's not his kidneys,
Sarah : but his kidneys are failing.
Sarah : Where's Dr. Cuddy?
Alan : Dr. House mentioned another case.
Alan : Is there another patient with the same thing that Ian has?
Cameron : - Not exactly. - What does that mean?
Cameron : Dr. House had a patient a while back
Cameron : who exhibited the same symptoms as your son.
Sarah : - Then you know what's wrong? - No.
Sarah : So what do you know?
Cameron : We know the likely course the disease will take.
Alan : Which is?
Cameron : She had multiple system failures affecting...
Sarah : What happened to her?
Cameron : She died 24 hours after her admission.
Foreman : Mr. or Mrs. Alston, would you mind giving me a hand?
Foreman : He's having trouble sitting still.
Foreman : It's impossible to get the detail we need.
UNK: So I figured he might feel more comfortable hearing your voices.
Sarah : Ian, honey.
Sarah : Just sit still. They'll be done in a moment. We're here with you.
Ian : I'm scared.
UNK: It's okay, honey. It's...
UNK: It's only a big camera. It's gonna take a picture of your head.
Sarah : You love it when I take your picture at home, don't you?
UNK: Yeah.
Sarah : And you have to hold still for that, too, right?
Ian : But this isn't like that.
Sarah : I know it's scary, Ian, but you can do it.
UNK: You're getting to be so grown-up.
Sarah : So just hold perfectly still, just for a little bit.
Ian : Mommy, are you crying?
Sarah : No. No, honey, I'm just tired.
Ian : Okay. I'll try.
Cameron : The base of his brain's been infiltrated by a small mass. We think...
House : - Pituitary? - Looks that way.
Foreman : Explains the low blood pressure.
UNK: And pretty much confirms the lymphoma.
UNK: If we'd started Ester on prednisone...
Chase : Did anyone see the lymphoma?
Cameron : No, we saw a mass. The location is consistent with...
Chase : Didn't see any in the blood either.
Chase : White blood cells show no spindling or abnormal nuclei.
Chase : Nothing on immunochemistries either. It's not lymphoma.
UNK: House!
House : It's a train.
House : - We don't know what kind of train... - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
House : - I'm thirsty. - It's closed.
House : It's not now.
UNK: We got one advantage. We know where the tracks are going.
Chase : The fact that the end of the line is death is an advantage?
House : The fact that we know is an advantage.
UNK: It means maybe we can get ahead of it.
House : Next station is the liver.
