UNK: We got about 90 minutes before it gets there.
House : Maybe we can cut down a tree across the line just outside of town.
Chase : I'll do an ultrasound.
House : No, treatment will tell us more, faster.
Cameron : How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we're treating for?
House : Treat him for everything.
House : Give him acetylcysteine, and interferon, and silymarin,
House : and whatever else you can think of to protect the liver.
Wilson : What's going on?
House : Oh, just catching up on some TV. How're you doing?
Wilson : Well, thanks to your last consult, the patient has improved dramatically.
Cuddy : Tell House the patient is about to kill the doctor.
Wilson : - She says the patient... - I heard.
House : - What've you got? - Well, Cuddy just raised and...
House : - You're paired. - What?
UNK: Nines.
Wilson : How do you know?
House : Anything lower, you wouldn't sound so excited.
UNK: Jacks or higher,
House : your voice sounds like Debbie from accounting is sitting in your lap.
House : Ask Cuddy if she can beat a pair of threes.
Wilson : What's going on? If you're gonna mess with me,
Wilson : wouldn't it be more fun to do it in person?
House : Yes, it would.
Wilson : Can you beat a pair of threes?
UNK: What'd she do?
Wilson : I left orders for PO fluids, Doctor.
House : Enough with the codes. She obviously knows it's me.
Wilson : She's drinking her seltzer.
House : Did she stop?
House : - Yes. - Go all in.
Cuddy : - But... - Just do it.
Wilson : You couldn't care less about this charity event.
Wilson : You claim not to be messing with me.
Wilson : You're either trying to keep me...
House : Shut up.
House : Look, last time I wanted the game to go on. I still do.
UNK: It means that this time you get to win.
Wilson : Hold on.
Cuddy : I fold.
UNK: House, are you sure you're okay?
Chase : Meds seem to be working. Liver's holding its own.
UNK: Good.
Chase : - But the platelets are dropping. - Even better.
Chase : Why? It means he's getting sicker.
House : It's new. New is good.
House : Because old ended in death.
Ian : I can't breathe.
UNK: Chase!
Sarah : What's happening?
Sarah : Ian, come on.
Sarah : Honey, just relax.
Sarah : Ian, breathe. Come on, honey. Please.
Sarah : Please, honey.
