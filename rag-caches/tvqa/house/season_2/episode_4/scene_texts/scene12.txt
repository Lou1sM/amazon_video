House : Two days ago, you were holding his hand. What's changed?
Cameron : He practically lives in Africa. There's no future.
House : On the other hand, maybe there's too much of a future now.
House : You weren't attracted to him because he was prepared to die for a cause.
House : You were attracted to him because he was actually doing it.
Cameron : - Right. It's that simple. - That was simple?
UNK: I put a label on him and go from there.
House : Everybody does it.
House : We are who people think we are.
House : People think he's a great doctor, so they give him stuff.
Cameron : - He is a great doctor. - The reality is irrelevant.
House : I'll prove it.
House : People who know me see me as an ass, treat me as an ass.
House : People who don't know me see a cripple, treat me like a cripple.
UNK: What sort of selfish jerk wouldn't take advantage of that fact?
House : Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah. I am so sorry.
House : It was completely my fault.
Cecelia : It's nothing. I'm fine.
House : Well, I'm very relieved. I feel terrible.
UNK: - Please don't worry about it. I'm fine. - You sure?
UNK: Okay.
Cuddy : How's everything?
UNK: I'm gonna go. My foot's killing me.
Wilson : - What did you do to... - It was nothing. It was all my fault.
Sebastian : Yeah, listen. Bogale, relax, okay?
UNK: I'm gonna be back on Tuesday.
UNK: Tell Sarni I'm gonna bring her a new brace. All right.
UNK: - Just in case. - You get them?
UNK: Six-months' supply. Should fix you right up.
UNK: I'll see you when you come back for a refill?
UNK: Yeah, I'll see you in two months.
UNK: You gonna give them away?
Sebastian : Well, you know how these things happen. You leave a bag on the airplane,
UNK: you drop some pills down the drain.
Sebastian : I have an idea. You could bring me the refill in Africa.
Cameron : I don't think so.
Sebastian : You actually like working for House? You find this satisfying?
UNK: There he is.
UNK: - It's good to see you. Dr. Sebastian. - Thank you.
Sebastian : Thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate the support.
House : It's not about the kids dying every eight seconds.
House : It's about the media stroking, adulation, the pats on the head.
Wilson : That's your problem with him, isn't it?
House : Look at him. Loves it, eats it up.
Wilson : Yeah, the man actually enjoys what he does.
House : Listen, I saved his life.
House : That means I get credit for every life he saves from here on out.
Wilson : I'll make sure Stockholm knows.
