House : He knows the answer going in. It's cheating.

House : You're a big help to patients who actually have cancer.
House : - Other times you're just annoying. - You've outdone yourself.

Cuddy : Cecelia Carter, remember her?
House : Last week they said it was mystery stew. They owe me.
Cuddy : She was just in my office crying because of the way you treated her.
Wilson : That doesn't sound like you.
House : Then it probably wasn't.
Cuddy : I get that you like to shock people,
Cuddy : stun them out of complacency, out of stupidity.

UNK: Just the salad today. Big breakfast.
UNK: Hey.
