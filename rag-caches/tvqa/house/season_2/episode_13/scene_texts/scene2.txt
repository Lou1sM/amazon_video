Cameron : A lot of, a lot of the other girls were...
Chase : When you wake up, you'll feel a lot better.
Dad : Nurse! Nurse!
Dad : You son of a bitch! You killed her!
House : - She's not dead. - She had a heart attack.
Foreman : She's stable now. The anesthesia...
Dad : Get her out of that coma.
House : - I don't think so. - Stop this!
UNK: All right, I don't consent anymore.
UNK: I want her to do the slow detox.
House : Did you ever get a paper cut? A really nasty one, between the fingers?
House : Multiply that by about a billion
UNK: and you'll just barely approach the kind of suffering she'll experience
House : if we wake her up now.
House : We're committed to this.
House : She's out till morning. Go get a book.
George : I haven't slept in weeks, because my teeth hurt.
UNK: The dentist couldn't find any cavities. And I'm getting these headaches.
House : Oh! Poor you.
George : I think I'm going crazy.
George : And my stomach, I roll out of bed and I wanna puke.
House : I take it you're married?
George : - You must be psychic. - You must be witty.
House : - When's she due? - How'd you know she was...
House : Because I'm doing her. You've got Couvade Syndrome.
UNK: It's just a fancy way of saying you should stop whining.
House : Millions of women have got the same thing. They're not bugging me.
House : You're suffering from sympathetic pregnancy.
House : Gotta go. People dying.
UNK: - Whole circle-of-life thing. - It's all in my head?
House : No, it's all in your hormones.
UNK: The good news is, no one's gonna lecture you if you smoke and get drunk.
Dad : Shouldn't she be awake by now?
Chase : It's only been a half an hour since we stopped the medicine.
Dad : Well, you said that's how long it would take.
Chase : I said it would take about a half an hour.
Dad : - Couldn't this mean something more... - So far, it means nothing.
Dad : She had a heart attack. She could have brain damage.
UNK: - She could have something more... - She's opening her eyes.
