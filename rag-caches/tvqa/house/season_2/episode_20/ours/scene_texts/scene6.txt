UNK: Patient Joe Luria, distal and proximal arm contractures.
Foreman : Duration four seconds.
House : Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.
House : Most commonly?
UNK: You want to treat me like any other patient, do it.
Foreman : But the House I know never uses phrases like "most commonly."
House : - You're not laughing anymore. - No.
UNK: You think that's a good thing?
House : Sort of doubt it.
House : Staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver or kidneys
House : before it gets to your brain.
House : Your organs are clear. It's not staph.
Foreman : The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
UNK: Which I would have seen in your MRI.
House : Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
Foreman : Let me see the MRI.
House : - There was no abscess on the image. - Let me see it, then.
House : I liked you better when you were jolly.
Foreman : MRI was taken over an hour ago.
UNK: That soft spot could now be an abscess.
House : If it was staph you'd have a fever, which you don't.
UNK: 101.6.
House : What idiot gave you that?
Foreman : Put the Ommaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
UNK: Triangle.
Chase : This one?
UNK: Circle.
UNK: Next.
Chase : Foreman, why aren't you answering? Is there a problem?
Foreman : - Square. - Tell me your date of birth.
UNK: Is that House? Yeah.
Chase : - Next? - Square again. Why is he here?
House : Because my neurologist is having surgery.
Foeman : I thought I was just another patient.
House : You didn't believe that crap, did you?
House : Date of birth.
Foreman : The Ommaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.
Foreman : My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.
House : Oops. Did you say Ommaya? I could have sworn you said biopsy.
House : Hey, I'm just messing with your head. Mother's maiden name, please.
Foreman : Get out of my temporal lobe, House.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Are you awake?
Joe : They told me somebody was sick like me.
Chase : I'm up.
Joe : Your voice...
Joe : Aren't you my doctor?
Foreman : Not anymore.
Joe : You're the guy who doesn't like cops?
UNK: Yeah.
Joe : Can you see?
Foreman : - You can't? - Not a thing.
Foreman : You've been blind a while.
Foreman : The fact that you're aware of it now could be a sign of improvement.
Joe : It hurts so much, doesn't it?
Foreman : I'm okay.
UNK: It's going to hurt.
Joe : The morphine barely takes the edge off.
UNK: I'm going to die, aren't I?
Foreman : You die, I die. It's not going to happen.
Joe : Why not?
Joe : Are you just too stubborn to die?
Foreman : They took a piece of my brain.
UNK: Whatever is wrong with us, they'll find.
Joe : Do you believe in prayer?
Foreman : Not really.
Joe : Neither do I.
Joe : My dad always prays.
Foreman : So does mine.
UNK: Do you want to try it?
Joe : Try praying?
UNK: Okay.
Wilson : - How is he? - Still dying.
UNK: Well, you've almost mastered another skill, though. That's good.
Chase : We have Foreman's biopsy results.
Chase : Non-specific signs of inflammation.
House : That's it?
UNK: I also swabbed for staph. Negative. He's not even a carrier.
House : Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too.
Wilson : Yeah, there's that.
Cameron : - Can I go to Joe's apartment now? - No.
UNK: Go back to the lab and start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.
Chase : - For what? - Everything.
House : Bacteria, toxins, fungus, anything that likes to feast on brain.
UNK: - That's thousands of... - Better hurry.
House : Cameron, suit up. You're going to monitor Foreman.
House : He's on to hand contractures. He'll be at Anton's blindness soon.
