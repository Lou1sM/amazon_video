House : Is your son depressed?
Emily : - No. Who are you? - I'm Dr. House.
Emily : Oh, you're the idiot who thought...
Doug : I heard him screaming all the way down the hallway.
UNK: If I didn't wake him up, I wouldn't have learned what caused the crash.
Foreman : He had a seizure.
Doug : This wasn't my fault?
House : Well, if he hadn't had the brain problem, he wouldn't have the burns.
House : On the other hand, if you hadn't put him on the ATV,
House : he also wouldn't have the burns.
House : You can debate your personal responsibility after I leave.
House : I need to wake him up again.
House : I need to know if he's taking antidepressants.
House : He's not.
Doug : - He's the happiest kid I know. - But you don't know, do you?
Doug : He's my son.
UNK: That's sort of my point.
UNK: At 16, they'll tell anyone anything, except their parents.
Emily : Adam talks to us about everything.
Emily : Yeah, I know about the pot and the cocaine.
Emily : There was never... Cocaine. What...
UNK: Are you sure? Are you having him followed?
Emily : He told us when he got drunk at a party.
Emily : He told us when he started having sex.
UNK: At 16? Way to go.
Emily : He told us when he cheated on a math test.
Emily : He told us when his girlfriend cheated on him.
Emily : - He doesn't hide anything from us. - But if he was depressed?
Emily : He'd tell us.
Emily : We don't judge, he's not depressed, we're sure.
UNK: "Bet his life on it" sure?
House : Just hypothetically.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Okay.
House : Kid's happy.
House : Happy, happy, happy.
Cameron : Then we're back to where we started. Seizure disorders.
Cameron : Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms.
Chase : Vascular malformations?
UNK: Would've seen it on the sonogram.
Foreman : Hepatic encephalopathy?
House : Liver enzyme tests were normal.
Cameron : - Where are you going? - Take a leak.
Doug : What are you doing?
UNK: You can't come in here, you're not sterile.
Emily : Don't touch our son, we told you...
House : Seriously, millions of bacteria, microbes on you.
House : He'll die of sepsis. If you go in there...
Brenda : I think he's gonna wake him up again.
Foreman : I know he is.
Foreman : House, you can't do this.
House : Oh, if I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. Relax.
UNK: Are they gonna sue us? If I'm right, I save his life.
House : If I'm wrong, he's dead no matter what I do.
House : Either way, how much have I really hurt them?
Emily : Leave him alone!
House : You're not sterile. Do you wanna kill the kid?
Foreman : - Give me the syringe. - No pain, no gain.
UNK: Hey, you gotta stop this.
House : They're right.
