Cuddy : You can't be serious.
House : Actually, I can.
House : See? It's my space. I want it back.
Cuddy : It's not your space. It's the hospital's space,
UNK: and the hospital thinks that the person who's worse off should get the better space.
Cuddy : Your application for a handicap space says you can walk 50 yards.
House : And Whitner's says she can roll 50 miles
House : between oil changes. I can't change my leg.
Cuddy : The space I moved you to is only 46 yards away from the front door.
Cuddy : I measured. You'll be fine. Great.
House : So I can collapse four yards into the lobby instead of outside in the cold.
Cuddy : As long as it's not in my office. Do you know who won
House : the New York City Marathon six years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair.
Cuddy : Then go get yourself one, and leave me alone.
House : Give me my space, I'll be happy to roll around all day.
