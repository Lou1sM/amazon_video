UNK: What are you gonna do now?
UNK: Oh, now I've got to slide my butt from one padded seat to another.
House : What if I bump my knee?
Foreman : MRI showed a granuloma in his liver.
UNK: Fantastic.
House : Wanna give me a hand here? No.
Foreman : Clotting, bleeding and a granuloma equals Wegener's.
Cop : I know. That's why I said fantastic. I was being sincere.
House : Now, give me a hand. Wouldn't be fair.
UNK: We're gonna biopsy the liver to confirm.
House : Wouldn't be fair not to.
House : People are good and kind and gentle and help people in wheelchairs.
UNK: You don't believe that. But you do.
Mother : No, I don't.
House : Foreman, forget the biopsy.
House : His liver will be gone before you get the results.
House : Start treatment with cyclophosphamide
House : before the Wegener's punches a hole in another pipe.
