Beth : Who is she?
Wilson : Well, as you know, this is a teaching hospital.
Beth : She's a student? No, I'm a doctor.
Cameron : I'm assisting Dr. Wilson today.
Beth : Why? Do you think he got my diagnosis wrong?
Cameron : No. I'm sure... No. No.
Wilson : She's just consulting regarding my prescriptions.
Beth : You think he got my meds wrong? No. It's just...
UNK: No. Then why is she here?
Kama : What are you doing now?
UNK: I'm gonna get a sample of your brother's spinal fluid.
Foreman : Where's Will? School.
Kama : Is that gonna hurt?
Foreman : It's gonna help us figure out what's making him sick.
Foreman : Shouldn't you be in class, too? Teacher work day.
Foreman : For you but not Will?
Kama : Yeah, didn't make sense to me, either.
Kama : Can I help?
Foreman : Well, I guess it's quicker than calling a nurse and a truant officer.
UNK: Okay, grab his shins and push his knees up towards his chest.
UNK: Now hold him there tight.
Kama : This all nurses do?
Foreman : My boss doesn't trust them to do anything else.
UNK: JACK GROANING
Kama : Is he gonna die?
Foreman : No. No one's gonna die.
Kama : In the whole world ever? That's so great.
Foreman : I meant... I know what you meant.
Kama : But I also know bad things do happen.
Kama : My dad always had a few drinks when they went out.
Kama : Always said he'd be okay to drive.
Kama : Until he wasn't.
Kama : I would just like some warning this time.
Foreman : We're nowhere near anything like that happening right now. Okay?
Foreman : Let's get him back over.
UNK: JACK SCREAMS
Kama : What was that?
UNK: What did you do?
House : You broke his rib? I barely touched him.
Chase : Which means...
UNK: GROANS
Nurse : Found it. Fix it.
UNK: Osteomyelitis. Means the infection's spread to his bones,
Chase : which means it's either bacterial or viral and not...
UNK: GROANS
House : I hired you to take away the pain. Was there some confusion?
Nurse : Ever thought about using your cane on the proper side?
House : Yeah, that's the issue.
House : Friday night my cane suddenly noticed it was on the wrong side.
House : Can you score me some Vicodin? No.
Foreman : I did a needle aspiration to confirm which... How long till the culture's...
UNK: SCREAMS
House : Why do you only do that when I'm talking?
Nurse : You gotta rest your shoulder.
Nurse : And we're gonna get you on some different equipment.
Cameron : Nice cane. If I know what you mean.
House : Chase, you can stop doing that. I'm almost finished.
Foreman : He's got osteomyelitis.
Foreman : Means you're wrong about food-borne toxins.
UNK: And you can stop, too. It's syphilis.
Cameron : You sure? Read the print out.
Cameron : He's also positive for Eikenella.
Chase : One of you two screwed up. No.
Cameron : Not a chance.
House : Or this kid is a lot sicker than we thought. Finish that test.
House : Should be impossible to get two right answers to one question.
Foreman : It's okay to have three? Apparently.
CHASE : He's positive for botulism, too.
UNK: So, we knock down one infection and three more pop up.
