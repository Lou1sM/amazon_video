House : Oh, for God's sake.
House : Stop. Don't move.
House : The way the soft evening light catches your eyes.
UNK: The gentle caress of dusk on your hair
House : as you turn around and leave my office without giving me that file.
Cuddy : Restrictive pericarditis.
UNK: Boring.
Cuddy : She's in kindergarten.
House : Less boring. Or Grandma's been held back a few years.
Cuddy : It's calcified and she's hypertensive.
UNK: Better get her into surgery.
Cuddy : She already is in surgery.
House : Tricky procedure. It's gonna take all night.
House : Sleep tight.
Cuddy : No congenital defects, no health problems,
Cuddy : but her heart is strangling itself.
UNK: Fascinating. Since the pathology on the pericardium
House : won't be back until after they remove it.
Cuddy : Get started on her blood. You can test for viral infections, bacterial...
House : Round up the usual suspects.
House : Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis.
House : Heck, go wild. Do all the -osises.
House : All taken care of. Sleep tight.
FOREMAN : This thing is already all around her heart.
Foreman : It gets into the muscle, she's dead.
Chase : Best bet's Coxsackie virus,
Chase : Parvovirus B19, CMV.
UNK: Bacterial infection's more likely to turn constrictive. It could be TB.
Chase : Right, forgot about the part where she did time in a Russian gulag.
Chase : Her hematocrit's elevated.
UNK: A few extra red blood cells means nothing.
Cameron : She's probably just dehydrated.
Chase : Yes, and I could assume three or four things to fit my theory, too.
Cameron : She's sick! She obviously hasn't been drinking enough...
UNK: Enough!
Foreman : I take it you two aren't sleeping together anymore?
Foreman : We do what House said, we test for everything.
UNK: Good, then I can go home.
Cameron : Since when does we not include you?
UNK: Well, House is gonna call us idiots, anyway.
Chase : Might as well be a well-rested idiot.
House : You guys are idiots.
Cameron : Why? Because we stayed up all night doing exactly what you told us to do?
House : No, because you stayed up all night doing exactly what I told you to do
House : and have nothing to show for it.
Foreman : We eliminated dozens of wrong answers.
UNK: I asked you what two plus two equals and a day later you tell me, "Not 25."
Chase : Pathology report just got filed.
UNK: They found granulomas in Lucy's pericardium.
UNK: Indicates a fungal infection.
House : Nice work.
Cameron : He went home.
House : Work smart, not hard.
House : Find out which fungus. Biopsy a lymph node.
House : Take employee of the month with you.
Cameron : I would rather Foreman... I know.
Lucy : I don't want any more shots.
Lucy : I don't want any more shots.
UNK: Jasper.
UNK: Look at me, Goosey. Squeeze my hand, okay?
Chase : This will tell us why you're sick, so that we can make you all better.
Deran : Where would she pick up a fungus?
Cameron : Anywhere moist. Around a pool, locker room, public shower...
Deran : She doesn't have any gym or swim classes.
Deran : She doesn't even like to play with kids outside.
Cameron : You haven't taken any trips? Gone anywhere new?
Deran : It's been hard to get away since their mom...
UNK: Our mom is dead.
Cameron : I'm sorry. Last year. Brain cancer.
UNK: You're gonna stick that thing in her arm?
UNK: Cool!
Cameron : The cool part is your sister won't feel a thing.
Jasper : Nice necklace.
UNK: Thanks. You like video games?
Cameron : Love them.
UNK: That should do it. You okay?
