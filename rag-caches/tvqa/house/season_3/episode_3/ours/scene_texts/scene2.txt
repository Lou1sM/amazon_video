UNK: Dad [around Tongue Depressor.] : Oh, sorry.
Daughter : But it's for the fall formal.
UNK: House [substituting For Dad, In A Faux Fatherly Voice.] : He doesn't care if it's for the presidential inauguration.
Daughter : But I'm using Marissa's old dress. It's free.
UNK: House [in Dad Voice.] : Yeah, you know what else is free?
UNK: House [in Dad Voice.] : Roof over your head, the food you eat, your phone, your computer.
UNK: House [in Dad Voice.] : How long have you been congested?
UNK: A week, ever since we got back from Fresno.
UNK: House [feeling Dad's Glands.] : Fresno? That's in France, right? See the Parthenon?
Dad : Uh, California.
Dad : I've got no appetite, I'm aching all over, I'm weak.
UNK: House [pushing 2 Fingers On The Guy's Forehead Sinuses And Interrupting.] : - Does that hurt? - Oh, yeah.
UNK: House [to Daughter.] : Does his voice always have that unattractive nasal tone?
UNK: Totally.
UNK: House [smiling At Her Slightly.] : I'm gonna take that giggle as a no.
UNK: House [smiling At Her Slightly.] : Fever, aches, weakness, loss of appetite.
UNK: House [smiling At Her Slightly.] : Been having any anal sex with IV drug users lately?
UNK: Dad [offended.] : Of course not, I'm married.
UNK: - Do you think he might've been-- - No!
UNK: House [nods.] : It's probably a rhinovirus.
Dad : What's that?
UNK: Cold.
UNK: Take this four times a day,
House : and stay off airplanes.
UNK: They're flying cesspools.
UNK: Daughter [rushing Over To Help Him Pick Up The Papers.] : You dropped something.
UNK: Daughter [rushing Over To Help Him Pick Up The Papers.] : If there's anything else you can think of, please call.
UNK: Yes?
Cameron : He's too old and weak.
UNK: Yeah, this is way, way better. This'll work.
UNK: Please, just try.
UNK: House [in The Viewing Room.] : There are 20 words to describe
UNK: House [in The Viewing Room.] : chest pain.
UNK: Burning,
UNK: squeezing,
UNK: House [in The Viewing Room.] : stabbing, tearing.
UNK: House [in The Viewing Room.] : Each one diagnostically useful.
UNK: House [in The Viewing Room.] : For that, you have to thank Dr. Powell's textbook.
UNK: But there are no words to describe degrees of what he's feeling right now--
UNK: House [in The Viewing Room.] : shortness of breath.
UNK: If he had worked on those issues, there would be.
UNK: 'Cause he would never have given up until he had an answer.
UNK: Cameron [pushes Stop Button On The Treadmill.] : This isn't working.
Powell : Dr. House.
House : Please don't get up.
House : I'm sure you're very busy,
UNK: so I'm just gonna try and speed things up a little.
Cameron : Is that epi? That's not the protocol.
UNK: House [injecting Into Powell's Iv.] : No, the protocol is what you tried to do and failed...
UNK: House [injecting Into Powell's Iv.] : each time.
UNK: Up over 100. Now we're getting somewhere.
UNK: House [injecting Into Powell's Iv.] : How's it look, Foreman?
UNK: Foreman [through Intercom.] : No EKG changes.
UNK: House [with Raised Eyebrows.] : - Then we push harder. - House, you're gonna kill him.
UNK: Powell [gasping.] : No, he's right!
UNK: Powell [gasping.] : Let him do it.
House : See? That's why he doesn't have to wear knee socks.
House : He can't breathe.
UNK: 130.
UNK: That's our magic number.
House : Nothing here. Foreman?
UNK: Still no sign of blockages.
House : Which means it's not the heart.
House : So it must be the lungs.
UNK: See? Wasn't so hard, was it?
Powell : No! Just give me the rest of the epinephrine.
Cameron : Test is over, it's okay, we're gonna stabilize you.
UNK: No!
Powell : No, just let me die.
Cameron : - You're not gonna die. - Yes, I am.
Cameron : We'll find a treatment.
