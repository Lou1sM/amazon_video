Ezra : Thank you.
UNK: I always wondered
Ezra : exactly what was on the other side.
UNK: Nothing.
Cameron : What are you doing?
House : Getting a laryngoscope.
House : - Don't just stand there, help. - But you told him--
UNK: It was something I like to call a lie. Bad, I know.
House : But it's way further down the list than murder.
House : He's unconscious,
House : no more whining.
House : Keep testing him.
House : Go get a ventilator.
UNK: I can't do this all night.
House : We can legally assume
House : that he'd consent to whatever a reasonable person would consent to.
Cameron : And a reasonable person would obviously consent
Cameron : to being put in a coma against their will just to satisfy your curiosity.
House : I try to kill him, you're mad.
House : I don't kill him, you're mad.
Cameron : - All he wanted was some dignity. - Were you in that room with him?
House : Was he wearing a tux while he was choking on his own plasma?
House : Keep doing the tests. Take your time, do it right.
UNK: Go.
House : Get to work.
UNK: Wait!
House : Cameron, why'd you do these cuts so far down on this MRI of his head?
Cameron : I wanted to get his brain stem and his c-spine,
Cameron : make sure his diaphragm wasn't paralyzed.
House : You also caught the top of his lungs. There's scarring.
House : You do know that you can't really pierce me with your stares?
Chase : Lung scarring, along with the bad bone marrow, points to an autoimmune disease.
