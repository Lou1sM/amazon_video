UNK: This is your sandbox.
House : Your jungle gym.
UNK: And under it is this.
House : I need to know if you ate this, Adam.
Dominic : He doesn't know what you want.
House : Adam, you have to tell me.

UNK: It's consistent with jimsonweed poisoning-- ocular paralysis.
UNK: Sorry.
House : The wicked shall deceive ye, because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots.
House : His ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.

House : It is easier for a wise man to gain access to heaven
UNK: Will you stop doing that? Just say "not M.S".
UNK: A stroke.

House : And you've already testified.
Foreman : It's a tumor.
Cameron : And all the imaging just missed it?
UNK: It's a microtumor.
Foreman : Started in his lung, which caused the pleural effusion.
Foreman : Then it metastasized to his liver, which made it slough cells.
Foreman : And then went to his brain, behind the eye, which caused it to roll back into his head.
