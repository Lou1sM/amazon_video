Chase : It's so you don't move during the procedure.
House : Is that nitrous? What, are you trying to kill her?
UNK: We gave her nitrous during the EEG.
House : That's what made this thing rear its ugly...
Chase : What thing?
House : B12 deficiency.
UNK: Are you having dÃ©ja vu?
Foreman : We've had this conversation. She was given B12. She didn't get better.
House : Because someone else ate it. Get an abdominal MRI.
Hannah : What? What are you doing? Don't touch me!
Hannah : Don't touch me! See? There's she goes.
Hannah : Don't touch me! Another paranoid delusion.
UNK: At the rate she's going downhill, forget the MRI. We need an OR.
Hannah : Leave me alone!
UNK: Occupied!
House : Her hernia can wait.
Hannah : Help! They're trying to kill me!
House : Okay, you can either believe that we really are trying to kill her,
House : or you can assume she's suffering from a medical condition.
House : Seeing as this is a hospital, and we're all dressed like doctors,
House : and there are easier ways to kill somebody...
Surgeon : Bev, help them. I'm gonna need iodine,
House : scalpel numbers 10 and 15, forceps and a largish salad bowl.
House : Okay, hold her down.
House : Come on, weenie, she's in a cast.
UNK: Swab.
UNK: Fifteen.
UNK: You're not gonna anesthetize her?
UNK: Relax. It's just a magic trick.
UNK: SCREAMING
House : She's faking it. We're not falling for it this time.
House : Okay, keep that retracted.
UNK: Forceps.
