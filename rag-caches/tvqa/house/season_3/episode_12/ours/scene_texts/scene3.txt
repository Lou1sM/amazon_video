UNK: SNIFFLING
UNK: All you gotta do is take these pills...
Eve : Don't touch me!
UNK: Runny-nose Guy : Oh, God.
House : I need someone to cover a patient.
UNK: House, you committed to...
House : She was raped.
UNK: You think I'm the right doctor for her?
Cuddy : We've assigned another doctor to your care.
Eve : I didn't mean to upset Dr. House.
Cuddy : He knows that. That's not why we're doing this.
Eve : I'd like to keep being treated by him.
UNK: Why?
Eve : Just do.
Cuddy : Trust me. It's better if you deal with somebody who specializes...
Eve : I'm fine.
Cuddy : You told Dr. House it's been less than a week.
Cuddy : You haven't told anyone other than him.
Cuddy : Emotionally you're still...
Cameron : You know what I'm dealing with?
Cameron : You know what I'm going through?
UNK: No.
Cuddy : You think Dr. House does?
Cuddy : I'm not suggesting either one of us be your doctor.
UNK: Dr. Stone is a psychiatrist.
Eve : If Dr. House is too busy, I could wait.
House : Why do you want me?
Eve : I don't know.
UNK: I don't want to treat you.
Eve : You're just saying that so I'll see the psychiatrist.
UNK: True. Except for the word "just."
House : I'm saying I don't want to treat you
House : so you'll see the psychiatrist
House : and because I don't want to treat you.
UNK: Why don't you want to treat me anymore?
House : I never wanted to treat you.
UNK: The fact that you were raped
UNK: HOUSE SIGHS
House : Holds no interest for me.
House : It's nothing personal.
House : There's nothing to treat.
House : You're physically healthy.
UNK: Okay.
Eve : But I want you to be my doctor.
UNK: Why?
Eve : I don't know.
House : You gotta have a reason. Everything has a reason.
Eve : I trust you.
UNK: Ah, you see? That's a bad reason.
House : 'Cause I'll lie to you.
House : I'll tell you anything just to get you out of here.
Cuddy : I don't care. I want to talk to you.
House : Look, you were raped.
House : All control was taken from you.
House : You're trying to find that control again.
House : You want me because I don't want you.
Eve : I'm raping you?
House : In a very non-invasive, more annoying than traumatic...
Eve : Get the hell out of here!
House : I'll send in Dr. Stone.
UNK: Homeless Old Guy : I didn't consent to all of this medicine.
Cameron : You've been out on the streets. No treatment...
UNK: I'm dying. There is no treatment for dying.
Cameron : We can make you comfortable.
UNK: Don't want to be. Why not?
UNK: Homeless Old Guy : Because I screwed up my life.
UNK: So you want to punish yourself for messing up your life?
UNK: Homeless Old Guy : Please, stop the treatment.
UNK: HICCUPS
UNK: Lt'll go away on its own.
UNK: It's not. Can't you...
House : Nope. It'll go away.
UNK: Hiccup Guy : It's been all day.
UNK: Hiccup Guy : There must be some treatment you...
House : Nope. It'll go away.
House : Or it won't go away.
UNK: Hiccup Guy : I read about a treatment.
UNK: Some doctor won a prize for it.
UNK: Hiccup Guy : I read about it.
House : You don't have the hiccups, do you?
House : Make a note, "Drug-seeking behavior."
UNK: Morphine?
UNK: No. Anal digital stimulation.
House : How long has Stone been in with her?
Cuddy : Are you concerned?
House : You know how many people get raped every day?
Cuddy : So it's common, therefore boring?
UNK: If we were to care about every person suffering on the planet,
House : life would shut down.
UNK: How about just the ones we meet?
House : They deserve our sympathy more than the other people?
Cuddy : So your solution is not to give a damn about any of them.
Cuddy : How do you do that? How do you take that theory
UNK: and put it in practice? You met her...
House : Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa!
UNK: Hey! I paid these people 50 bucks to leave here an hour ago.
