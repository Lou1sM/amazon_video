CHASE : You were right.
Chase : Surgeon found a bleed behind the kidney
UNK: in the retroperitoneal cavity, but no reason for it.
Chase : No cancer, no ruptured arteries.
Chase : So bleeding explains the symptoms
Chase : but we've got no explanation for the bleeding.
Chase : And while they were closing him up,
Chase : Patrick had a grand mal seizure,
Chase : which makes no sense,
Chase : since he's on an anticonvulsant medication.
House : You told him.
Wilson : No, I didn't.
Wilson : I only told Cameron.
HOUSE : Hey!
House : Okay, you guys have cleverly deduced that I have cancer.
House : You have no right to know.
House : You have no business knowing.
Foreman : We'd like to run some blood tests.
House : As soon as you work up our patient, who is not me.
UNK: We just want to make sure you weren't misdiagnosed.
House : I wasn't. Let's move on.
Chase : We're just asking for a couple of vials.
UNK: No! Why not?
House : Okay, we are going to proceed as if I am perfectly healthy.
Chase : How can we do that if we know you're not?
House : You don't know anything!
House : Except, hopefully,
UNK: how a patient on anticonvulsant medication has a seizure.
Foreman : Anti-seizure meds don't prevent seizures.
Foreman : They just make them manageable.
House : According to the surgeon's report,
House : this one wasn't even close to manageable.
Cameron : Means the question isn't, "Why is he having seizures?"
UNK: It's, "Why are his seizures getting worse?"
House : What's changed?
Foreman : His brain. It's gotten worse.
UNK: So we make it even worser.
House : We take him off anticonvulsant medication.
CAMERON : He'll seize even more.
Cameron : Multiple seizures can seriously damage a brain.
House : Dude can't button a shirt.
House : How much more damage are we really talking about?
UNK: Stronger seizures will light up different parts of the brain,
Chase : which will indicate which parts are damaged.
House : Once he gets worse, do a PET scan.
UNK: DOOR SHUTS
House : PET scan done?
UNK: No.
UNK: Did you come for my feelings?
House : 'Cause I left them in my other pants.
Cameron : This is a letter of recommendation.
Cameron : I'm applying for a job at Penn.
House : Thank you for writing your own.
UNK: I'm sure my thoughts are beautifully phrased.
Cameron : Thank you for signing it, saves me having to fake your signature.
House : Stay away from Weiss.
House : He cries with his patients, holds their hands as they die.
House : He won't like you.
House : Your newfound nonchalance in the face of cancer.
Cameron : I thought you'd find it appealing.
UNK: 20 seconds. Pretty good.
Cameron : For what?
UNK: The time it took you to go from hard-ass to human being.
UNK: You really want to leave?
Cameron : If you're not here, there's not much point in staying.
House : I'm not dead yet.
House : What are you doing?
House : I know this must be a turn-on for you.
