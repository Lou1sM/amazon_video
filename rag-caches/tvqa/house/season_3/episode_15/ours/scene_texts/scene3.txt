Cuddy : He should have symptoms.
Cuddy : Blurred vision, headaches, confusion, clumsiness.
UNK: Depends how far along the cancer is.
UNK: What kind, how aggressive.
Cuddy : He didn't tell you?
Cuddy : House is House.
Wilson : He's no different than anyone else with cancer.
Wilson : Once you tell, then every conversation is about that.
FOREMAN : Cardiac arrest means we were wrong.
UNK: There was a heart problem.
Foreman : But no vasoconstriction.
Foreman : The heart problem couldn't have caused the hand problem.
House : Unless the bleed happened suddenly.
House : Less blood to the brain explains the dystonia.
House : Less blood to the heart explains the heart attack.

House : If that doesn't work, gut him.
UNK: Can't you sedate him?
Chase : There's a risk his throat could collapse.
Patrick : You look mad, Papa.
UNK: No.
UNK: Dr. Obyedkov : No, I'm not mad. I promise you.

UNK: Dr. Obyedkov : And it's gonna hurt.
Patrick : Hurt me? Why hurt me?
UNK: Dr. Obyedkov : Make you better.
Patrick : What's wrong with me?
UNK: Well, they don't know.
UNK: Dr. Obyedkov : Patrick, don't you worry.
UNK: Dr. Obyedkov : Everything is gonna be great.
House : All right. Here we go, Patrick.
UNK: You wanna hurt me.
UNK: Hey, open. Like this.
UNK: Dr. Obyedkov : You just look at me and everything is gonna be okay.
UNK: Look at me now.
UNK: Patrick.
UNK: There you are. It's okay. It's okay, really.
UNK: Dr. Wilson. Wilson!
UNK: I just spoke to Cuddy.
Cameron : She can't confirm whether House

UNK: Yeah. I'm late for a...
Cameron : If I have to look for work, I have a right to know.
UNK: PLAYING PIANO
UNK: Pretty.
House : I wrote this when I was in junior high school.
House : Could never figure out what came next.
UNK: Then dimwit came up with this.
UNK: PLAYING PIANO
Wilson : It's good.
House : It's perfect.
Wilson : I could set up a tower on the roof during a lightning storm.
Wilson : Help you switch brains with your patient.
Wilson : Then you would be the brilliant pianist
Wilson : and he would be the doctor hiding brain cancer from his friend.
House : It's nothing.
Wilson : You need to talk about it.
Wilson : You need to talk about it.
Wilson : At least let me look at your medical file.
House : You're making a big deal out of nothing.
House : Who else knows?
Foreman : No one, and cancer isn't nothing.
House : Sorry. Didn't mean to offend your specialty.
Wilson : Why didn't you come to me?
House : Stein's good.
Wilson : Stein's in Africa for the next six months.
House : He's given me at least six months.
UNK: I go to Boston. I get the treatment.
House : Everything will be fine.
House : No need to talk about it.
