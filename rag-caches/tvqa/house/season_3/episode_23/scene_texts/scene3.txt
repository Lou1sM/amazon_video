Nate : Just give me more shrooms, okay? I'll be fine.
Enid : You only need my consent, right?
Chase : Yeah, but it'll be a lot easier if...
Enid : Do whatever you have to do.
Nate : You don't touch me, all right? You can touch me, just not my brain.
UNK: Nate, you got to do this. I can't take it anymore...
Nate : My God, Mom! Save me the melodramatic hand-wringing, okay?
Nate : Loosen up! Get yourself coited.
UNK: I'm going to give him a sedative.
Nate : You're decent-looking, Dr. Skippy.
Nate : Why don't you take her for a ride?
UNK: Nate?
UNK: Nate?
Cameron : His heart rate's normal. Respiration's even.
Enid : What's happening? What's the matter with him?
Chase : He's jaundiced. His liver's shutting down.
CHASE : We've started him on sodium polystyrene sulfonate.
UNK: His liver's operating at about 20%
Chase : and deteriorating fast.
House : Which means he'll be dead long before Foreman turns in his parking pass.
House : So what causes personality disorder, head pain, blah, blah, blah,
House : and liver failure?
Chase : Liver failure can cause hypogonadism, head pain.
Chase : Altered mental status leads to the personality disorder and rage.
Chase : All we need to do is figure out what caused the liver failure.
House : Yes. Also, we need to figure out how symptoms yesterday
House : can be caused by liver failure today.
Cameron : If his liver's failing now, it wasn't great yesterday.
Cameron : If it wasn't operating at capacity, it could have caused...
UNK: EXCLAIMING
House : Don't sneak up on a person like that!
Foreman : I'm listening.
House : Well, listening doesn't help me.
House : Okay. Let's go with the liver and a time-machine theory.
House : Foreman, what causes liver problems?
Foreman : Wilson's Disease.
UNK: No. Ceruloplasmin is normal.
Cameron : No enlargement and no palpable mass, so no cancer.
Chase : Could be a narrowing of the bile ducts. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.
House : Most liver damage begins with what we put in our bodies. Foreman?
Foreman : Angry teen... Alcohol.
Chase : No. Blood tests were negative.
Cameron : No signs of drug use or acetaminophen poisoning in his tox screen.
Cameron : Maybe the water was contaminated.
Chase : His mother would also be sick.
UNK: Cuddy?
UNK: Sounded like someone would back.
UNK: Go.
House : We'll try and muddle through without your blank stare to guide us.
House : So if it's not the bad things he's putting in, what about the good things?
Chase : He was raised a vegetarian.
UNK: "Was raised."
House : Means he's all grown up, or he's not a vegetarian anymore.
Chase : He started eating red meat a few months ago.
Cameron : Unless he's been buying cuts of mad cow,
Cameron : his body would have no problem metabolizing it.
UNK: What if he had an OTC deficiency?
House : Body can't metabolize nitrogen, damages the liver.
