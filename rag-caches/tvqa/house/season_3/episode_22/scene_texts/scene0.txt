House : Good morning.
UNK: This is funny. People don't...
Cameron : Not done reading. Go away.
Cameron : Most likely, she coughed it up.
Cameron : Which would mean it's from her lungs. Drugs, toxins, infection...
UNK: No fever and no elevated white count. Which rules out infection.
Cameron : And blood panels found no drugs, no toxins.
UNK: The bronchoscopy was pristine. So much for the lungs.
House : Good morning. Not yet.
Cameron : So then, the blood came from her stomach.
Cameron : Which would mean it's an ulcer or a GI bleed.
Chase : Which means no ulcer or GI bleed.
Chase : Which means it's not from the stomach, either.
Chase : Which means it didn't come from anywhere.
House : You guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?
Foreman : Rupture in her sinus cavity? Drip through the back?
House : Not that much blood. Trauma from karate?
House : No trauma. She kicked the other guy's ass.
Cuddy : Now a good time?
House : If you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear in a...
UNK: Now. This includes you.
Cameron : What's going on?
House : Feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.
Cuddy : Are you sure? Yeah.
UNK: Why?
House : He's afraid of turning into me.
Cuddy : Well, that's a good enough reason.
Cuddy : Sign here.
Chase : Doesn't look promising.
Cuddy : Good luck.
Foreman : Thank you. That's it?
House : You're not going to tell him that we're a family
House : and families don't abandon each other?
Cuddy : You want me to? No.
Cuddy : Would it make any difference? No.
Cuddy : Good luck, Dr. Foreman.
House : So, where were we?
Chase : College sophomore coughing up blood.
House : Not the case. The speculation. The palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts.
HOUSE : Did Foreman get a promotion?
Foreman : I resigned.
UNK: What?
House : Personally, I can't believe I've had the same three employees for three years.
Chase : Patient could have a heart problem.
House : Yes. Life goes on. Look at the eager beaver combing his hair.
Chase : Hyper-dynamic heart could force too much blood into her lungs.
Chase : She coughed up the overflow.
Chase : Wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because it's traveling through normal plumbing.
