Jodie : We love you.
Wilson : I'm sorry.
UNK: Ready?
UNK: Ready.
House : My patient's about to have a heart attack. It's going to be massive.
UNK: Oh, wow. That's too bad.
UNK: Because I just got tickets to a stroke on the third floor.
Cuddy : Have you had a conversation with Foreman?
UNK: Do me a favor?
Foreman : You haven't.
Cuddy : Because then you would have to confront your own emotions.
House : Is bile an emotion? Because I definitely feel something here.
House : Get me some liquorice. This is going to be the best heart attack of all time.
House : Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait! She's going to shock her.
Cuddy : There's always tomorrow.
Foreman : You wanted to see me?
Foreman : Pretty sure the label is straight.
Wilson : Are you really going to leave? Where are you going?
Wilson : You lined up interviews yet? I'm not sure.
Wilson : You're pissed at House. I get it. You're symbolicating killing him.
Wilson : Symbolicating. What? Symbolicalating.
Wilson : Gosh, that's a hard word. Are you okay?
Wilson : Hey, I'm not the one... I'm not the one...
Wilson : I'm not the one pretending to kill someone.
Wilson : What would it take for you to stay? Is it money? He wants you to stay.
Foreman : He said that? If I said he said that,
UNK: PHONE RINGING Would that make a difference?
UNK: Are you sure you're okay? Hello?
Wilson : I'm leaving now.
Wilson : I'm late for a breast thing. You know he wants you.
Wilson : You know he's good. You know he can make you good.
Wilson : I don't know what I'm saying. You know... I don't... You know what I'm saying.
Wilson : And you know I'm right. I've got to go.
Wilson : Sorry it took me so long to get down here. I'm Dr. Wilson.
UNK: I guess Dr. Stein is gone. Don't worry about it.
Wilson : I'll talk to him when we're done.
Patient : Dr. Stein said they're probably calcium deposits.
UNK: But with your medical history, you don't want to take chances.
Wilson : I can't seem to put my gloves on today. That's weird.
UNK: Okay. Well, that's fine. One's enough. Well, let's have a look.
Patient : You sure talk fast.
Wilson : This is nothing. You should see me when we're busy.
Wilson : I just winked at you. I just... I've never winked at a patient in my life.
UNK: I have no... I am so sorry. I have no idea what I was thinking.
House : It's okay. No, it's not. I was hitting on you.
Wilson : I mean, I wasn't... I wasn't consciously hitting on you, but I...
Wilson : What else could you think? That you were being reassuring?
Wilson : Yeah. That would make sense. On the other hand, I...
Wilson : I feel like my heart's going to explode.
UNK: Are you okay?
Wilson : I feel a little sweaty. Am I sweating?
UNK: Yeah.
Patient : Is something wrong? I can't...
Wilson : I put on gloves to do a breast exam. Perfect. Sorry.
