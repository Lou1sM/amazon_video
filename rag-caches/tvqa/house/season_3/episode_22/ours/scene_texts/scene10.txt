UNK: And I don't get hazy on Vicodin, or anything else I throw down.
Chase : Which means I was throwing down something

House : Why didn't you give me those happy pills?
Wilson : I told you. You've got to be checked out by...
House : No, you just didn't want me double-dosing.
Wilson : You dosed me!
House : Those coffees... They worked!
Wilson : You've been smiling, relaxed, happy.
House : A dying girl thought I was happy.
House : A moron thought I was happy.
House : Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?
Wilson : House was happy. Hazy.
UNK: Happy. Hazy!
Wilson : Oh, right. A dying girl mistook hazy for happy.
Wilson : Because dying people see happiness everywhere.
Wilson : She's miserable. She wasn't miserable.
Wilson : Of course she was miserable. You just told her...
House : She was no different than she'd ever been.
House : She was no different than she'd ever been.
Wilson : Oh, God.
UNK: I gotta go.
House : Need a minute with your daughter.
Ben : Dr. House, get out of here before...
UNK: She's gonna live.
House : Does that help? Now, get out.
