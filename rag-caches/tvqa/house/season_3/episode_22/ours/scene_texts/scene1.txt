UNK: Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right.
House : Cameron? Check out the dorm, then re-do the ER labs.
House : I'll get going on Foreman's farewell party.
House : Everybody good with a "Mermaid Under the Stars" theme?
Chase : So, why are you leaving?
Chase : Or is it just some sort of power play?
Foreman : You can have my parking space, my locker.
Chase : Is it about House?
Foreman : Let me get all sensitive and confide in you.
Foreman : Addie? Pedal harder. Need your heart rate at 170.
Chase : Why wouldn't you want to tell me?
Foreman : I don't like you. Never have. Never will.
Cuddy : You want me to share some more?
Chase : Even if you do hate me, if you'd found another job, you'd tell me.
Chase : If House did something to drive you out of here, you'd tell me.
Chase : The fact that you won't tell me means that whatever the real reason is
Chase : you're ashamed of it.
ADDIE : Guys? I'm at 170.
Chase : Pulmonary artery looks good. It's not a heart problem.
Chase : Are you cold? No.
UNK: Scared? I'm okay. Why?
Chase : On your arm.
Chase : Addie has goose bumps.
Foreman : No recovering from those babies.
Chase : You don't have goose bumps for no reason.
Chase : They're a reaction to the body thinking it's cold.
Foreman : She wasn't cold. Her temperature was normal.
UNK: But her body thought it was. Which means...
Foreman : What? A brain problem?
UNK: A messed up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps
Foreman : but they're not going to cause her to cough up blood.
Foreman : She has no neurological issues. She had a shiver.
House : I think there's an infection.
Foreman : We've ruled out infection because no fever, no white count.
House : I think there's an infection.
House : Blood goes where it's needed. Infection likes nice, wet places. Her lungs.
House : Start treatment. All that cool stuff for bacterial, fungal, and atypical infections.
House : Get a lung biopsy. I want to see the little bugger up close.
UNK: Why is Foreman quitting?
House : He wants to breed llamas.
UNK: Interesting.
Chase : You're ashamed of the reason, too.
House : No one writes tamoxifen like you.
UNK: Well, I use a "G."
House : Foreman resigned.
Wilson : I'm sorry.
House : It's okay. No biggie.
Wilson : Right. He give a reason?
House : He said he didn't want to end up like me. I had a brilliant retort.
UNK: I can't remember what it was at the moment.
Wilson : You don't want to end up like you.
House : Good point. Can I resign?
House : What's up with that?
