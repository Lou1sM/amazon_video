Tyson : What are you doing?
House : You're trying to be me, so I thought I'd try to be you.
Cuddy : You don't have the cleavage for it.
House : But I have a much tighter ass.
House : Think every day should be naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron?
House : Let me see the results from the bladder tap.
Cuddy : They aren't back yet.
UNK: They're gonna be inconclusive.
Cuddy : You think my diagnosis is wrong?
House : Fetus doesn't pee, amniotic fluid should be low.
House : Mom's level is fine.
Cuddy : Doesn't mean I'm wrong.
Cuddy : Could just mean we caught the obstruction early.
House : Either way your test will be inconclusive.
UNK: The urine you've collected has been sitting in that fetus's bladder for weeks.
House : As my pappy always said, "Stale pee is useless pee."
UNK: Fine. I'll do another tap.
House : Just as useless.
House : Old urine drops down from the kidney right after the first tap
UNK: 'cause it's so backed up.
House : Bladder tap number three will give you the freshest pee.
UNK: That's when you'll find out if this fetus has even a fighting chance.
Emma : Thank you.
Cuddy : I'll run two more taps.
House : Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps?
Cuddy : She's an important patient.
House : Because she takes pictures or because she's you?
UNK: Woman in her 40s, single,
House : using a turkey baster as a last gasp at motherhood.
Emma : Maybe you want to make sure she succeeds so you'll still have hope.
UNK: You can't be a good doctor if you're not objective.
Cuddy : It's your file. I don't want it.
