House : What's amazing is how blonde your baby's hair is.
Emma : My baby?
House : The thing in your belly that tried to kill you.

House : Any pain?
Emma : Nothing I can't deal with.
House : You can only get out of bed to pee, pooh or shower.
House : And absolutely no sex. So stop flirting with me.
UNK: Sorry.
Emma : So this really worked? He'll be normal?
UNK: Well, if you call being born twice normal.
Emma : Hey, thank you.
House : Don't thank me. I would've killed the kid.

Cameron : She got you to glow.

House : You didn't need to apologize.
Cuddy : I'm not. I told you why I...
House : Screwed up.
Cuddy : I saved a life. I saved two lives.
UNK: You
House : let your maternal instinct get the best of you and nearly kill two people.
House : Case like this, you terminate, mom lives 10 times out of 10.
House : You do what you did
House : mom and baby both die 9.9 times out of 10.
UNK: Sometimes point one is bigger than 9.9.
