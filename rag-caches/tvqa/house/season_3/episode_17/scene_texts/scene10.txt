House : Me again.
UNK: It's your friendly neighborhood belly squirter.
UNK: We're gonna do open fetal surgery.
House : Open the uterus, cut out the fetus so we can look around.
House : I know you can't talk so I need you to look petrified if you consent.
House : The umbilical cord won't be cut.
Cuddy : During surgery, your body will basically serve as the baby's heartllung machine.
Cuddy : We find what's wrong and we fix it.
Cuddy : If we can.
House : Don't lower expectations if you want them to do something.
Cuddy : She should know what she's facing.
Cuddy : This is incredibly dangerous.
Cuddy : It risks both your lives.
Cuddy : The only reason why we're suggesting
Cuddy : it is because there's nothing else we can do.
House : You all here for the fetal surgery?
Cameron : 'Cause we're way over capacity.
House : Mind each other's personal space.
House : There are sharp implements in the room.
House : Like this one.
House : Uterus is fully exposed.
Surgeon : And we're in.
Surgeon : Start draining the amniotic fluid.
House : Have you never sucked beer out of the bottom of a keg?
House : Where'd you go to college? Give me that.
Cuddy : Affix the pulse ox to the palm.
UNK: House?
UNK: Sorry.
Cuddy : Fetal heart rate good. Stats are stable.
House : Position him for the incision.
Surgeon : I see three well-defined lesions.
Surgeon : It's definitely CCAM. I should be able to resect them.
UNK: MONITOR BEEPING
House : It's the mom. She's in V-fib.
UNK: Charging.
UNK: Clear! I'm clear.
House : Looks like asystole. Paddling isn't going to do anything.
Cuddy : It's fine V-fib. I'm going again. Clear!
UNK: We're gonna lose them both. Clamp!
House : The surgery's not doing this to her. The fetus is.
Cuddy : Step away, House. I'm going again.
House : The only way to save her is to cut away the anchor holding her down.
