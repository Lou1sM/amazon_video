UNK: Does nobody speak Korean on this flight?
Cuddy : I assumed you did.
House : I know how to ask him if his sister's over 18,
UNK: I just don't think that's gonna help.
UNK: Hey, stand up. Stand up.
House : Don't play the cripple card with me.
Robin : Oh, hi. I'm leaving.
UNK: Work.
UNK: Okay.
Robin : Important client. Sure.
UNK: Listen.
Wilson : Are you close?
UNK: Why?
Wilson : She needs a mammogram.
Robin : Oh, God.
Wilson : I know I'm throwing a lot at you. She just has no family in town.
Wilson : And I really think she could use a friend right now.
Cameron : Okay. Put your hand here.
Fran : You don't have to stay.
Robin : No, it's no problem.
Fran : But why?
Fran : You don't even know me.
Robin : You gotta be scared.
Fran : I almost hope it's breast cancer. No.
Fran : Then it wouldn't be my fault.
Robin : Whatever it is, it's not your fault.
Fran : That's not true. You can control things.
Fran : Not everything.
Fran : But you don't have to take stupid risks. I was being an idiot.
Robin : You were having fun.
Fran : You have regrets?
UNK: Yeah.
Cameron : Hold still.
UNK: Good.
Cameron : Okay, we're gonna get just one more. I'm sorry, I know it hurts.
Fran : It's not that.
Fran : It's my eye. My right eye.
Fran : I can't see.
House : It's definitely ataxia. And it's definitely a rash.
UNK: You gonna look at it for five more minutes before concluding it's also definitely a leg?
House : Thin leg.
House : It's been in a cast. So?
House : So it could be radiation poisoning.
Cuddy : From a broken leg?
House : From the x-rays they took of it.
Cuddy : He could break every bone in his body
Cuddy : and still not have enough x-rays to cause radiation sickness.
House : Unless those x-rays were performed in Wankoff, North Korea,
House : by a third-grade dropout with a 50-year-old imager.
House : Which accounts for the absence of fur.
House : Radiation poisoning accounts for all his symptoms.
Joy : I have hair. I haven't had an x-ray since I got my teeth whitened.
House : You're pregnant.
Joy : I'm what?
House : Explains the nausea, abdominal pains, fever,
House : and why you're stuffing your 36Cs into a 34B bra.
CUDDY : And her rash?
House : PUPPPs. Common pregnancy rash.
Joy : I can't be pregnant.
House : You a virgin?
Cameron : No, but...
House : You're pregnant. Mazel tov.
House : Let's get him into the chair.
Cuddy : Two different diagnoses.
Cuddy : I thought you didn't believe in coincidences.
House : I believe in statistics.
House : Two hundred passengers on the plane, 10 should be gay,
House : two should be with child, and one should be incredibly annoying
House : with an extra ass chromosome. House.
House : Get him some iodized salt to protect his thyroid. I'm going back...
UNK: House.
Cuddy : You're wrong.
UNK: I said we should have turned back. You should have listened to me.
Cuddy : Now we're eight miles over the Arctic...
House : I'm trying to listen to you now, so shut up.
