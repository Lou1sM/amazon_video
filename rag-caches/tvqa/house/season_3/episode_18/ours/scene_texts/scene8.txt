UNK: It's now spreading through his digestive tract.
Cuddy : You think he's a mule.
House : I think he's a jackass.
House : We're gonna have to operate. Cool!
Chase : They're gonna kill her. We were wrong.
Cameron : Which means Foreman was right.
Chase : Maybe Foreman's right about us, too. Maybe we should just stop all this.
Chase : I mean, if it's affecting our jobs.
Cameron : It's not affecting our jobs.
Chase : We had sex in a patient's bedroom. A bedroom we were examining for toxins.
Chase : Yeah, our judgment's right on the mark.
Cameron : All right. No more sex in patient's homes, no more sex with cats watching.
Cameron : Anywhere else you wanna cross off the list?
Chase : The bowl. What?
Chase : Has she eaten since she's been here?
Cameron : She's been sick since she's been here.
Chase : What if it's a symptom? Well, why would you think...
Chase : The bowl was full.
House : You're gonna need to hold him down. He's not gonna like this.
UNK: Do you really think he's a mule?
House : Fits the symptoms.
UNK: Air Cameron : You sure he's not contagious?
House : Pretty much.
UNK: You can't be pretty much sure. Means you're not sure.
House : Oh, aren't you clever?
UNK: Come on.
UNK: I know you're pretty much unconscious,
UNK: but as has been pointed out to me, pretty much doesn't mean squat.
House : Okay, hold him tight.
House : The faster we do this, the less likely he is to die of shock.
UNK: Tighter.
UNK: Sorry. Do that again.
UNK: Ease off and then press down.
House : Pressure on his joints relieves his pain.
UNK: Okay. Wrong again.
House : Where's his wallet?
