Wilson : And what were you doing when you fainted?
Fran : We were just... Looking for her cat.
UNK: And have you banged your head recently?
UNK: No.
UNK: Is this a motion sickness patch?
Fran : I must have forgotten to take it off. I just got back from a trip.
Wilson : Scopolamine can cause dizziness and blurred vision.
Wilson : You probably hit your head when you fell, and that caused the blackout.
Robin : I thought those patches were supposed to prevent you from getting sick.
UNK: Every drug has a side effect.
Wilson : But it might be a good idea to keep your eye on her
Wilson : for the next few hours to make sure she's okay.
UNK: Actually...
Fran : She has to get back to work.
Robin : Is it important?
Wilson : We just don't like people to be alone after they leave here.
Fran : I'm fine. Really.
UNK: I'm... Fran?
UNK: Fran?
Wilson : I got a seizure. Code cart.
Robin : What's wrong with her?
Wilson : I have no idea.
Wilson : Where's House?
GIRL : I want my blankie! I want my blankie! I want my blankie!
House : Antique vintner's cane. Cost me $900.
Cuddy : It had a corkscrew in it.
UNK: That would explain the vintner's reference.
Cuddy : It could be used as a weapon against the pilot.
House : Only if he's stuck in a bottle of zinfandel.
Cuddy : You'll get it back when we land.
UNK: Noisy Girl : I want my blankie! I want my blankie!
UNK: Give her 20 milligrams of antihistamine. Could save her life.
UNK: 'Cause if she doesn't shut up I'll kill her.
Cuddy : Delivering goodwill to yet another continent.
House : You only forced me to deliver a speech, not goodwill.
Cuddy : You gave a three-minute speech.
Cuddy : You know how much WHO accreditation means to the hospital?
UNK: Well, it may have been short, but it had girth.
Cuddy : And the room service thing was just spiteful.
House : I was hungry. $300 for a bottle of wine.
House : I was thirsty.
UNK: $120 on video services.
House : I was lonely.
UNK: That's 500 in expenses I can't justify.
House : Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Here you are, sir. You're welcome.
UNK: Welcome aboard, Mr. House.
Keo : You're right here in 2-A.
Keo : Ms. Cuddy you're in the next cabin and to the left, 9-C.
Cuddy : No, I booked two first-class tickets.
Cuddy : This must be a mistake. No mistake.
UNK: I just arranged for a $500 fare reduction.
House : Expense problem solved.
Wilson : Where did you travel? Duluth.
Fran : To visit my sister. Really?
Wilson : Is this her artwork?
Robin : "Fire butt"?
Fran : I was a little drunk.
Wilson : Where were you a little drunk?
UNK: I turned 58 last March.
Fran : Same age my mother was when she died.
Fran : Next week I packed a bag, I went to JFK,
Fran : looked at the big board, took the first plane that went to a warm place.
UNK: Caracas. Oh, my God.
Wilson : Did you drink the water? Eat salads?
Wilson : Any raw foods. Yup.
UNK: And?
Fran : I also did mescal shooters and snorted cocaine from a homosexual man's stomach.
Wilson : Did you have sex? No.
Fran : Not with him. I had sex with El Gordo.
Fran : He was a large man.
Robin : Oh, my God.
Fran : I never do things like that.
Fran : I should have gone to visit my sister. It was stupid.
UNK: That's why I'm sick, isn't it?
Wilson : It's possible.
UNK: GROANING
Keo : Here you are. Rib eye, medium rare.
House : Thank you.
Keo : Some more Pinot Grigio?
