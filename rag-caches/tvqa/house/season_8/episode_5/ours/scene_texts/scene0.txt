Foreman : why the hell do you want to come back?
Chase : Tired of surfing.
Foreman : He hasn't changed.
Chase : And neither has the job, right? We still get to do crazy crap'?

Chase : He has no choice.
Chase : He's the boss now.
Chase : He has to be professional.
Chase : Has to base his decisions on what's best for the entire hospital.
Chase : We can't take it personally.
Foreman : Couldn't have said it better myself.
Chase : You did.
Chase : I'm just reading the notes on your desk.
Chase : He also wants us to spy for him.
Foreman : Not spy. I'm trying to keep House out of prison.
Foreman : To do that, I need to know what he's doing and planning.
UNK: SPY- SPY...
Foreman : Come on, guys.
UNK: Look, I am your boss, you do have to treat me appropriately,
Foreman : but it doesn't have to be awkward and weird.
Foreman : Outside of work, I still consider us all friends.
Taub : I'm glad you feel that way, because I do have a favor to ask.
Taub : I told House I couldn't come back until next week.
