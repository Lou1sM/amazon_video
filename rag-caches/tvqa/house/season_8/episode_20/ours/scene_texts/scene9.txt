UNK: I'm busy.
Park : The biopsy showed fibrosis in his cardiac muscle.
Chase : So it's not a prion disease.
Park : It means Foreman was wrong, too.
Park : He wants everyone to meet in his office to DDx.
Chase : So he can tell us all it's an infection?
Park : Interesting, or maybe you should consider not being such a baby.
UNK: My first instinct was an exposure from a corpse.
UNK: Chase walking Around The Room, Looking For Things : Treiber spends all his time here.
UNK: Chase walking Around The Room, Looking For Things : If it's not toxic gas, or prions,
UNK: Chase walking Around The Room, Looking For Things : then it has to be something else. He's not perfect.
Park : Are you trying to cure him or discredit him?
Chase : Treiber can only see me as "Not House", Foreman, too.
Chase : And they're not wrong.
Park : So you're not coming upstairs?
Chase : No. And when this case is over, I'm quitting.
Foreman : He's not quitting.
Taub : He already called other hospitals.
Taub : Treiber did get under his skin.
Foreman : He'll get over it.
Foreman : Fibrosis has to be a response to an infection.
