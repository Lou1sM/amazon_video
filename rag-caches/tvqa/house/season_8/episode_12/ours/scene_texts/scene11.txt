Chase : The Mexican Pipeline.
Chase : Early May is when the surf really picks up, but...
Moira : What's wrong?
Moira : I spoke to the prioress...
Chase : You're going back?
Moira : I felt the calling.
Chase : When you saw the boy?
Moira : I felt God's love, his grace. I've been waiting my entire life for that.
Chase : It's not real.
Moira : I know you didn't feel anything when you almost died. I did.
UNK: You fell oxygen deprivation, you felt your brain releasing noradrenaline.
Moira : You didn't say that before.
Chase : I wanted you to move on with your life.
Chase : I wanted to reassure you. I wanted you to feel better.
Moira : And now you don't?
UNK: Now...
Chase : I think I love you.
House : "Noradrenaline and Near-Death Experiences." Oh, dear.
