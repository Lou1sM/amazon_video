Chase : I need more help. My patient has a new symptom, ischemic foot.
Chase : Get the lecture out of your system, so we can talk about my case.

Chase : Okay, I'm curious...
House : Your overreaction to your stabbing is

UNK: Are you okay?
Chase : I almost got you killed by bringing a scalpel into that room.

Adams : I think the ledger's clear.
Adams : But how can you not be traumatized?
Chase : Can't change what happened.
UNK: I can only make better choices from here.
Adams : So you're Zen about it, but won't let go of your anger toward House.
Adams : I'm seeing a trauma counselor. I think you should, too.
Chase : I'm okay. Just knowing you're there for me is enough.
UNK: The convent lets you have this?
Moira : I borrowed it from one of the nurses.
