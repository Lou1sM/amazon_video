Cofield : Let the record show that we are officially
UNK: convening a disciplinary hearing
UNK: regarding the events on February 3rd, 2012, in patient room 209.
Cofield : Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published
Cofield : along with all supporting documentation and rulings.
Cofield : Do you have any questions before we get started?
UNK: Yeah.
House : Who the hell are you?
Cofield : I'm Walter Cofield. Chief of Neurology, Mercy Hospital.
Cofield : I'll be deciding your fate today.
UNK: Cofield.
House : You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy.
House : Which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman.
House : Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.
Cofield : This hearing isn't about me, Dr. House.
Cofield : I know you'd like to make it about me
Cofield : because then it wouldn't be about you.
UNK: It's interesting that he picked the old mentor to judge the new one.
Cofield : Interesting' but not relevant.
Cofield : The facts of this case,
UNK: on the other hand... The facts are in the file.
House : If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call.
House : I'm going back to work.
Cofield : If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor.
Cofield : The facts say you should be suspended.
Cofield : Which, from what I understand,
Cofield : would mean a revocation of your parole.
House : The patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher.
