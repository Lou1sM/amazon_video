House : All the more reason why we should shut down.
House : We cure this kid now, crazy grandpa
House : and his magic beads get all the credit.
Adams : And since when do you care about credit?
Adams : Since when do I care about this kid?
House : having faith in faith.
House : Kid's better off dead.
House : Soon as she's done appeasing the gods, let's talk.
Chase : What about Kawasaki?
Taub : Explains the irregular heartbeat,
Foreman : respiratory distress and seizures.
Park : It fits.
Adams : Which means he needs a coronary bypass.
House : It can't be Kawasaki.
UNK: The echo would've shown it.
House : But a patent ductus arteriosis...
Taub : It can't be a PDA.
Taub : He's not an infant nor has he had any symptoms for eight years.
House : Maybe he has.
House : Maybe he had an infected ductus
House : which we inadvertently treated with antibiotics.
Taub : So no evidence is evidence of evidence?
House : Just saying it's consistent.
UNK: It's a billion to one.
House : Which means there are seven people
House : in the world who fit the diagnosis.
Taub : I thought we were looking for 100.
House : Maybe PDA is more common than we thought.
UNK: But idiot doctors like you...
Xang : You're wrong.
Adams : But the treatment's just ibuprofen.
Adams : Closes the malformed duct.
Adams : Worst-case scenario, he just doesn't get better.
House : Worst-case scenario is, you piss me off...
Chase : You're not gonna let us save an eight-year-old
Chase : because one more person might embrace religion?
House : Does anyone here think my diagnosis is right?
UNK: Well, then, I've decided, for today only, to respect your opinions.
House : We'll proceed according to your diagnosis.
UNK: And nothing else.
UNK: That's an order.
UNK: Good luck.
Taub : We need to put him on the OR schedule.
UNK: His BP is dropping.
Taub : He's crashing. Call a code.
Adams : You need to stop this.
Adams : I'm giving him the ibuprofen.
