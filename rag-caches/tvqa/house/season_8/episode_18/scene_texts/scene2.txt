Taub : I'll tell you what would be weirder.
Taub : If you didn't dream about having sex with Chase.
House : Have you? No.
Taub : But I've dreamed about having sex
Taub : with a lot of people I work with
Taub : and it didn't freak me out.
Park : That's different
UNK: How?
Park : 'Cause you've actually had sex with a lot of people at work
Park : and that hasn't freaked you out.
Taub : Good point.
Taub : So you're worried about what it means?
Park : I'm not worried. It means nothing.
Park : It means something, doesn't it?
Park : I work with him. I can't want to sleep with him.
Taub : Maybe Chase just represents work.
Taub : You're just falling in love with your job.
Park : It has been very satisfying lately.
Taub : You smell that?
UNK: Yeah. Ll smells like a wet dog.
Taub : It's mold. It's not mold.
Taub : It's definitely mold.
Taub : I don't see any sign of water damage.
Taub : Holy crap.
Taub : It looked like a slaughterhouse.
Lida : I don't know what you're talking about.
Lida : It was clean when we left.
Taub : You're telling us some random person broke into your house
Taub : to dismember a pig in your son's bedroom?
UNK: A pie?
Lida : My father-in-law.
Lida : What did you do?
Xang : What you should have done weeks ago, when the dreams started.
Xang : I'm saving Lue.
Nurse : He's coding! Need a doctor in here!
Nurse : V-tach. No pulse.
Lida : - Oh, my God. - Push one milligram epi.
Taub : - Paddles. Charge to 50. - Charging.
UNK: Clear.
Park : Still V-tach.
Taub : Charge to 100.
UNK: 100.
UNK: Clear.
UNK: Charging... Wait. Normal sinus rhythm.
Taub : He's stable, but we've obviously got a second symptom.
UNK: Yeah, yeah, kid's in V-tach. Tell me about the luau in his bedroom.
Park : It's a traditional Hmong ceremony.
UNK: It's supposed to call back the kid's soul.
UNK: Hasn't he heard of star 69?
Taub : There's more.
Taub : The reason grandpa thinks the kid's soul was stolen
