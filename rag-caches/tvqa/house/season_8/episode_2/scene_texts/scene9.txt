UNK: Hi.
House : Case is under control. It's me time.
Wilson : Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry.
Wilson : You were right to push me. I needed that. Thank you.
House : So we're good?
UNK: It was good advice. I just came here to say thank you.
House : I like you.
House : I have fun with you.
House : And if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me,
House : I can accept that
House : But just do whatever you have to do to get over this.
House : Punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.
UNK: Either/or. Both seems excessive.
Wilson : The thing is' House,
Wilson : I don't like you.
House : When did the discoloration start?
Park : A few minutes after I started the MG.
Park : Means we're wrong about infection.
UNK: Dr. Simpson : And by we, you mean you. You screwed up the lungs.
House : Wrong about auto-immune, about cancer,
House : heavy metals, genetic issues...
House : Increase PEEP.
UNK: Dr. Simpson : Already maxed out.
UNK: Dr. Simpson : We're close to the point of no return.
UNK: Dr. Simpson : The lungs will never be viable for transplant.
House : I need ideas.
Park : IgA nephropathy?
UNK: It's already ruled out.
UNK: Lupus? No.
Park : Maybe we're just out of time.
House : We're out of time when we're out of time. When they die or she dies.
House : Keep them stable as long as you can.
House : I need to think.
Wilson : One, two, three!
Everyone : Make a wish, make a wish!
