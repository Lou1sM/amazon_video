House : There's no actual risk.
House : As long as you're both paying attention
House : and are both good enough to work here.

UNK: House [still Pointing The Light At Him.] : each one sending light to your eye
UNK: at a slightly different wavelength.
UNK: Ortho Doctor : Turn that off.

UNK: On, cool.
UNK: You think I'm not.Ã¢ÂÂ
UNK: Ortho Doc : You think I'm not gonna go to Foreman with this?
UNK: House [turns Off The Light] : You will and I'll deny it.

UNK: House [turns Off The Light] : And you won't be able to prove anything.
