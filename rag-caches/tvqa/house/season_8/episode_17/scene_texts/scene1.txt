Park : Have you ever paid for sex?
Taub : Every guy who's ever seen a Merchant Ivory movie has paid for sex.
Taub : No. It just seems too demeaning to women.
Park : Given the things you've done to women, that seems arbitrary.
UNK: Young Man : You're Chi Park, right? Who's asking?
UNK: Young Man : You called about my guitar flyer. You're Micah.
Park : This guy's selling a 1974 Gibson SG Standard in tobacco for $1,250.
Micah : Yeah, actually, I came in to tell you I already sold ll. Sorry.
Park : Oh, uh... Thanks anyway.
UNK: Taub looking Through The Microscope : Blood panel results seem pretty much the same as before.
UNK: Taub looking Through The Microscope : And that guy likes you.
Park : Maybe we should check for diabetes. Could weaken conjunctival vessels.
Park : And shut up.
Taub : If I'm wrong, then why is he coming back?
Micah : My band is rehearsing tomorrow night. You should come by and jam with us.
