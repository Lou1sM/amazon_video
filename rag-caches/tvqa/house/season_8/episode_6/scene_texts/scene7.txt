Taub : I thought you were gonna go to bed early last night.
Ruby : Like an idiot, I went out with my girlfriends to pretend I have a life.
Ruby : When all I did was flirt with guys
Ruby : who'd have no interest in a mom,
UNK: and miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of,
Ruby : and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.
Taub : You need your own place. Yes.
Ruby : I moved back home because it was too drafty at the Four Seasons.
Taub : So go back to work at the hospital.
Ruby : Day care costs more than what I earned as a nurse.
Taub : Have you considered sub-standard day care?
Taub : Why don't you stay here tonight?
Taub : No, I mean in the guest room.
UNK: I'll watch the baby again, you can get a real night's sleep.
Ruby : You'd do that?
UNK: Win-win.
UNK: Mommy gets a rest, Daddy gets more time with his little angel.
UNK: There's some sweats in the closet in the back.
Taub : Lucky girl, gets another sleepover with Dada.
Taub : Makes a difference,
Taub : doesn't it?
