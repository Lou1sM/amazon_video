House : I need a meeting.
House : Thanks for fitting me in.
House : My team has eight urgent, life-or-death cases
House : that they've been waiting for me to accept or reject.
Foreman : When is that not true?
House : Well, right now for one.
House : But tell my parole board that I'm taking all eight.
House : That no one else can crack them,
House : that you need me here for the next five months
House : or eight people will die.
Foreman : You're asking me to perjure myself.
UNK: Just a tiny white lie. No of fence.
House : Especially since from what I hear nothing black is tiny.
House : Except your penis, I guess.
House : You really think I wanted to cave in that ceiling?
House : It was a prank that went wrong.
House : Dock my pay, sue me...
Foreman : Felony vandalism should've added
Foreman : another year or two to your sentence.
Foreman : It's a miracle the parole board agreed to six months.
House : I will go to jail. Eventually.
UNK: I will pay the price. I'd just rather that Wilson didn't.
House : Come on. Be a friend.
UNK: Okay.
Foreman : But whatever cases you have, you have to take them all.
Kutner : "Be a friend"?
House : How many fingers am I holding up?
House : Of course, you know it's three
House : because you know everything I know,
House : everything my smack-addled brain can remember.
House : Including that I actually said, "Be a friend."
Kutner : My point wasn't that you said it.
Kutner : My point was, once again, why?
Kutner : I think it's because part of you knew
House : you were going to need a friend.
Kutner : Part of you knew the plan, even when it was working, wouldn't work.
Kutner : And right now, I'm curious about why you're sitting on the ground
Kutner : instead of heading for the door.
