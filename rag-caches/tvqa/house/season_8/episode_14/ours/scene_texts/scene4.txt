House : Not the dead dad, the biological dad.
House : The one I pointed out to you at the fake father's funeral.
UNK: Hun!
Wilson : Are you sure?
Wilson : Your only evidence is that birthmark you saw when you were 12.
House : Well, now I've seen two.
UNK: The good news is, I won't technically be a bastard much longer.
House : We're gonna be one big crappy family.
UNK: Well, that's great news.
Wilson : Your mother won't be alone anymore and you can finally get to know the guy.
UNK: Yes. That is one option.
Wilson : Are you saying you're not even curious?
Wilson : You want to know what I think?
House : I think you know the answer to that question.
Wilson : You avoid your mother
Wilson : because she's the one person whose opinion you actually care about.
House : If that was true, you'd have every reason to shut up.
House : I avoid my mother because she's boring.
Wilson : That's why you've been so open and honest about prison
Wilson : and marrying a complete stranger.
House : Even if I care what she thinks,
House : why would I care what some sperm donor does?
Wilson : You read the guy's book about three times.
UNK: Years ago and it took three times because it was so badly written.
Park : The second birthmark was on his penis, right?
UNK: The kid's a dick.
Chase : You've been working for House for months
Chase : and just now realized that disabled people can also be dicks'?
