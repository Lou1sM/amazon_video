Will : I don't want her to hate me.
Adams : When she finds out you bought an engagement ring for another woman,
Adams : that option is out the window.
UNK: It was going to be for her.
Adams : What changed?
Will : She told me we were going on a break.
Will : I didn't even get a say in the matter.
Adams : She wanted you to be sure about your relationship.
Adams : I can see how that would be annoying.
Will : I think I liked it better when you were just breathing angrily.
Will : She still sees me as the same sheltered blind geek she met in college.
Will : Most of the time she acts more like my mother than my girlfriend.
Will : I asked her to marry me. She tells me I need to date somebody else first?
Will : I'd rather she just dumped me.
Will : At least that I can understand.
Adams : So you were hurt so much you had to marry the next woman you met?
Will : Julie doesn't see me as I was,
Will : but for who I am now.
Will : She trusts me to make my own decisions and to help her with hers.
Will : For the first time in my life,
Will : I have somebody who needs me instead of the other way around.
