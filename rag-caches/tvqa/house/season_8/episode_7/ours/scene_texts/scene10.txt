UNK: Ifs okay. Now that we know what it is,
House : he'll need treatment but he'll live.
UNK: You know, there are platitudes that can help you with that.
Mickey : I miss him, too.
Adams : She's responding well.
Foreman : Cuddy threatened him with clinic duty.
Foreman : I thought threatening him with jail would be different.
Wilson : Not an irrational thought.
Foreman : I'm still sending him back.
Wilson : He saved two lives.
Foreman : Which means it's too late for me to back down.
Foreman : It's no longer my choice.
Foreman : It's just me telling him he can get away with anything.
Foreman : I have to send him to prison.
Wilson : Your job is to keep this machine running.
Wilson : It's your choice to make House a useful tool or a monkey wrench.
Wilson : Cuddy's way didn't fail.
Wilson : Because she didn't try to control House, she managed him.
UNK: And she knew better than anybody what a tool he could be.
Foreman : What would Cuddy have done?
House : Ten clinic hours.
Foreman : Cuddy's not here anymore.
UNK: You've got 30.
