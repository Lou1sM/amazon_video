House : How's your patient?
Wilson : She died a few hours ago.
UNK: Thirteen's back.
Wilson : No department, no money,
UNK: and somehow, you manage to con her into hanging around.
House : I have a gift.
UNK: What?
House : It was a con.
Wilson : The patient was faking?
House : No, I was.
House : I brought him in here under false pretenses just to get his money.
House : I ordered a bunch of random tests to keep him here.
House : One of them was a head CT which uses iodine contrast.
Wilson : You think he's allergic to iodine?
House : No. Again.
House : Just don't interrupt me.
House : Thirteen was right. This is a thyroid issue.
House : He has Plummer's disease.
