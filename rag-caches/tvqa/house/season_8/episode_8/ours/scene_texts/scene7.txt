Taub : Good for him.
Taub : Married one's not a keeper, but it's a start.
Chase : You're an idiot.
Nurse : He has stridor but no obstruction.
Chase : He's anaphylaxing. Get me a trach kit.
UNK: Scalpel.
Chase : It's not working. There's no breath sounds. Doesn't make any sense.
Taub : His trachea's blocked below the incision point.
Taub : - We need racemic epinephrine. - We tried that already.
Taub : We're gonna try again. It's our only choice.
Chase : We got him breathing, but barely.
Adams : At least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did.
Adams : Because we're not doing anything.
Taub : Which is a good thing because neither GAD nor a systemic infection
Taub : would cause anaphylaxis or tracheal edema.
Park : And an allergic reaction wouldn't get worse
Park : three days after he was admitted.
UNK: So we got nothing.
House : Unless he was still being poisoned.
Adams : By who?
Adams : His wife wasn't even here when he hallucinated.
House : Good question.
Adams : Now we're the ones being paranoid.
Adams : What about squamous cell carcinoma?
Park : If it's only in his epithelium,
Park : it wouldn't show up on his chest x-ray.
Chase : It is possible, but...
House : Wouldn't cause hallucinations.
UNK: It could if he also had paraneoplastic syndrome.
House : Get a biopsy.
Taub : You think it's cancer?
House : I think you should get a biopsy.
