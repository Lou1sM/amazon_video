Foreman : Just making an observation.
UNK: Well done. And now, as a member of my team,
UNK: you can make the equally useful observations that the sky is blue,
House : I'm wearing pants, and I'm ignoring your first observation.
Foreman : Of course.
UNK: Wait.
House : And there it is.
Foreman : You're trying to screw with my confidence.
House : Well, if I wanted to do that,
House : I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.
Foreman : You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate
Foreman : to keep me from ever intervening,
Foreman : even if it's fully in the scope of my duties.
Foreman : Like now. This isn't about diagnostics,
Foreman : it's about what's safe for the patient.
Foreman : Do the ultrasound.
House : Ultrasound it is.
House : And the nurses love you.
Foreman : You don't think I knew House was gonna tell you to ignore me
Foreman : and not do the ultrasound?
Chase : This is an ultrasound machine.
Foreman : Which you're gonna use to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy.
UNK: You've probably got a kit stashed here...
Adams : "Cuddy Dark will waste his afternoon chasing conspiracy theories."
Chase : You're letting him get inside your head.
UNK: He can do a lot of damage in there.
Natalie : Dr. Chase, he started vomiting again.
Chase : This is why we stopped the antiemetics.
Chase : We needed to see if it was still a symptom.
UNK: Okay.
Natalie : Here. You want this?
UNK: Andres [agitated] : Get your hands off me. You're taking my head!
Natalie : It's okay, Andres. You're in the hospital.
Chase : 10 milligrams of diazepam.
Foreman : Already on it.
UNK: Hey! NATALIE : I'm fine. I'm fine.
UNK: Foreman.
Foreman : Blood in his urine.
UNK: We resumed the antiemetics and increased his sedation.
Adams : He really went after her.
Park : Maybe he found out about her "good friend."
