UNK: Amber Volakis : How are you doing?
UNK: "thirteen" : I'm fine.
UNK: Amber Volakis : FYI, if you ask me, it's more the guys' fault than yours.
UNK: Amber Volakis : And House isn't blameless, either.
UNK: Amber Volakis : If he hadn't pitted us all against each other...
UNK: "thirteen" : It was my fault. My mistake.
UNK: Chris Taub : Was that always there?
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Travis Brennan : It's House.
UNK: Good morning, angels.
UNK: Greg House : As you will see from the file, we have quite the interesting case.
UNK: It's not often you get a patient who sees dead people.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : What file?
UNK: Greg House : What the hell?
UNK: I gave it to Bosley a half-hour ago.
UNK: It was not a half-hour, it was 10 minutes.
UNK: Allison Cameron : And he made copies of the ER records first.
UNK: Greg House : Less lip, more whip.
UNK: Greg House : I only agreed to take this case
UNK: Greg House : because you said that this mocha frapalicious would have whip on it.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Fine. I'll refer the case to Foreman.
UNK: Greg House : Can't. Mercy fired him.
UNK: Gimme. He got fired?
UNK: He disobeyed a superior officer under fire. He's lucky he wasn't executed.
UNK: Allison Cameron : How do you know about it? You keeping tabs on him?
UNK: Greg House : Girls talk.
UNK: Greg House : When Bosley drags his ancient ass in there...
UNK: Henry Dobson : I'm here.
UNK: Twenty-four year old funeral cosmetician suffered a grand mal seizure at work.
UNK: Chris Taub : Why does he get to be Bosley?
UNK: You want to be Bosley? Bosley's, like, the asexual messenger boy.
UNK: Henry Dobson : She had a vision of being raped by a cadaver before passing out.
UNK: Henry Dobson : Seizure rules out psychiatric illness.
UNK: Henry Dobson : No history of epilepsy, head trauma or drug use.
UNK: Chris Taub : Bosley keeps his job while they replace five angels over three seasons.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Could be a tumor to the temporal lobe.
UNK: Chris Taub : Not with a normal CT scan.
UNK: Amber Volakis : You mean, it appeared normal to the doc in the ER.
UNK: Greg House : Way to get right back on that horse, Thirteen.
UNK: "thirteen" : No, that was Amber.
UNK: Greg House : Nice try, Cutthroat Bitch.
UNK: That was the worst Thirteen imitation I've ever heard.
UNK: Chris Taub : Funeral home prep rooms are filled with toxic chemicals.
UNK: Travis Brennan : And cadavers. Everybody in that place obviously died from something.
UNK: Chris Taub : I have a question. Is he the one who's not a doctor?
UNK: Henry Dobson : Bullets aren't contagious, but infections, parasites...
UNK: Chris Taub : You said one of us wasn't a doctor, and you called him a fraud.
UNK: He's not a doctor. Continue, Bos.
UNK: Henry Dobson : Could be an STD.
UNK: Chris Taub : Why isn't he fired?
UNK: Greg House : You're breaking up.
UNK: Greg House : Going into a tunnel.
UNK: Greg House : Dark Religious Nut.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : What did you call me?
UNK: Greg House : I'm sorry.
UNK: Greg House : What do you people want to be called this week?
UNK: Cole.
UNK: No, I'm never gonna remember that.
UNK: Greg House : Take Bosley and the other visible minority to the funeral home.
UNK: Greg House : The rest of you young, white people, the world is your oyster.
UNK: Do an MRI with contrast, EEG, LP and a blood panel.
UNK: Greg House : And, angels, be careful.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Just because he's religious, doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.
UNK: You want to bet? No.
UNK: Allison Cameron : I want you to stop being such a jerk to him.
UNK: $100.
UNK: Smart call. The guy's a wuss.
UNK: He'll be the next one on the train.
UNK: Define "kick your ass. "
UNK: Greg House : Any physical confrontation?
UNK: Allison Cameron : Or verbal?
UNK: Greg House : Define verbal.
UNK: Anything over 70 decibels.
