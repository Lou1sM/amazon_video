UNK: Connie Walesa : If you have it while you're driving...
UNK: Irene Walesa : You can drive me, make sure I take it easy.
UNK: "thirteen" : Who can?
UNK: Irene Walesa : My mother.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : Your mother's here?
UNK: Irene Walesa : What are you talking about? She's right there.
UNK: Greg House : You sampled every bodily fluid,
UNK: Greg House : peeked in her brain, violated a cadaver's privacy, dug up a body,
UNK: Greg House : but missed the fact
UNK: that she was still seeing things that weren't there.
UNK: Neurological symptoms are getting worse.
UNK: It'd be nice if one of you angelslmorons had a clue why.
UNK: Chris Taub : We did a full history. She never mentioned seeing or hearing anything unusual.
UNK: Greg House : Well, as long as she never said anything, how were you to know?
UNK: Greg House : Same thing with the spinal fluid? She tell you that was fine?
UNK: Travis Brennan : The labs were all clear.
UNK: Greg House : Then either we're about to meet the Alpha and Omega,
UNK: Greg House : or you missed something.
UNK: Henry Dobson : We missed the new symptom.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : It's not a new symptom. We always knew she had hallucinations.
UNK: Seeing your dead mother's a hallucination.
UNK: Henry Dobson : Not knowing she's dead is a delusion.
UNK: Greg House : You keep this up, you're gonna have to start wearing sexier clothes.
UNK: Chris Taub : Carbon monoxide could also cause delusions. A lot of haunted houses...
UNK: Henry Dobson : There's no headache, no tachycardia.
UNK: Henry Dobson : I guess they didn't cover that at your medical school.
UNK: "thirteen" : What about a hereditary connection? I mean, she's 24.
UNK: Her mother died when she was 25.
UNK: In Ukraine, 20 years ago. Good luck trying to get those records.
UNK: So we start new records.
UNK: Greg House : Test for every hereditary disease that fits the symptoms.
UNK: There are at least 40 different mitochondrial disorders,
UNK: Chris Taub : another couple hundred...
UNK: Start with amyloidosis and you keep going until you reach zamyloidosis.
UNK: Irene Walesa : Now what are you testing for?
UNK: Irene Walesa : Or should I ask what you are not testing for?
UNK: Amber Volakis : Well, we could narrow it down if you could remember what your mother died from.
UNK: Irene Walesa : My mother is not dead. She's sitting right there.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Do you think we're lying to you?
UNK: "thirteen" : Leave it alone.
UNK: "thirteen" : Convincing her that her mother's dead isn't gonna make her better,
UNK: "thirteen" : just miserable.
UNK: Amber Volakis : You lose your mother?
UNK: Amber Volakis : Do you think we're trying to trick you? Why would we do that?
UNK: Irene Walesa : Because you're mean, and you're not good at your job.
UNK: Connie Walesa : Reena, stop. You're being cruel.
UNK: Irene Walesa : They're wasting time,
UNK: Irene Walesa : doing exactly what the guy in the wheelchair said they'd do.
UNK: "thirteen" : A guy in a wheelchair was here?
UNK: Irene Walesa : You know who I'm talking about.
UNK: Irene Walesa : He's been hanging around ever since they brought me in,
UNK: Irene Walesa : complaining about how incompetent everyone is.
UNK: He said you killed his dog.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : It doesn't make any sense.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I'm not interested.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : If you weren't interested, you wouldn't be here.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I thought it was social.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : No, you didn't. You always think there's an agenda.
UNK: Eric Foreman : That's why I left.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : That's why you're good.
UNK: You need a job. I'll find a job.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I need someone that understands House.
UNK: Eric Foreman : They'll learn.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I need someone that can control House.
UNK: Keep looking. It might take a while.
