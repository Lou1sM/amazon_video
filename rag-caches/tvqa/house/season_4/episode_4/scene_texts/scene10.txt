UNK: Mama.
UNK: Greg House : As you know, there are seven of you and...
UNK: One, two, three, four...
UNK: Greg House : Only six roses.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Those are peonies.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : But I'm sure they're part of the rose family.
UNK: Greg House : Actually, I'm surprised there are seven of you.
UNK: Greg House : You punch your boss and stick around?
UNK: Give me the flower and shut up.
UNK: Greg House : Don't overdo it.
UNK: Greg House : Now, I would love to keep all of you, but not enough to do anything about it.
UNK: Greg House : So, according to my arbitrary schedule, one of you has to go.
UNK: Amber Volakis : You're kidding!
UNK: Amber Volakis : I came up with the answer. I robbed a grave. I...
UNK: "thirteen" : Planted a dog collar in the procedure room just to screw with my head.
UNK: Amber Volakis : No, I never.
UNK: "thirteen" : What, you don't believe she did it?
UNK: Greg House : I'm sure she did it.
UNK: Greg House : That's why she's getting the flower. It was beautiful, she just overreached.
UNK: She got into your head. No, I...
UNK: Greg House : She owned you.
UNK: Greg House : Planting the idea was good.
UNK: Greg House : Letting it fester was good. Leaving the collar was stupid.
UNK: Well-known fact, ghosts don't leave things lying around.
UNK: "thirteen" : So, am I gone then?
UNK: Oh, my goodness. I totally forgot about you two. Well played.
UNK: Greg House : Sorry, Henry.
UNK: Greg House : We had some giggles.
UNK: Chris Taub : You agreed with everything he said. You finished each other's sentences.
UNK: That's why I got to go.
UNK: Henry Dobson : Don't need someone to tell you what you're already thinking.
UNK: Greg House : Funny, I was gonna say that.
UNK: If you want to hang out... Yeah, I know.
UNK: Henry Dobson : Call Wilson.
UNK: The rest of you, 8 : 00 tomorrow.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Cash will be fine.
UNK: Greg House : I bet you say that to all the guys.
UNK: Greg House : Take your blood money.
UNK: Greg House : Who are you gonna protect next?
UNK: Allison Cameron : If I told you, it wouldn't work.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I've re-thought some things.
UNK: Dr. Pilcher : Glad to hear it.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I'm prepared to come back on a number of conditions.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I want the raise you promised, plus five percent.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I want my own office and a personal assistant.
UNK: That's not unreasonable.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I will give you none of those.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You can come back at your original salary.
UNK: Eric Foreman : What's going on?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You haven't re-thought anything.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You've just been black-balled.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You're "House, Lite" now.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : The only administrator that will touch you is the one who hired "House, Classic. "
UNK: The good news is she'll pretend she's not doing you a favor.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I can start Monday.
