UNK: James Wilson : What is this sudden obsession with the afterlife?
UNK: My only obsession is with the idiots in the right-here-and-now life
UNK: Greg House : who think there's an afterlife.
UNK: And you want me to... Nothing.
UNK: Just needed a place to hang low for a while. I'm pretending to be spooked.
UNK: Because?
UNK: Greg House : Because if my soon-to-be-brain-dead patient thinks that I believe her,
UNK: Greg House : maybe she'll let me chat with her mother's ghost.
UNK: James Wilson : The one you don't believe exists.
UNK: Exactly.
UNK: Greg House : The ghost is a hallucination, which is the result of a delusion,
UNK: Greg House : which most likely is the result of a hereditary disease
UNK: Greg House : that her mother died from when the patient was four.
UNK: James Wilson : And you think you can tap into her subconscious memory
UNK: James Wilson : by tapping into her hallucination.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Greg House : She might not know what caused her mother's death,
UNK: Greg House : but she will know how she acted before she died.
UNK: James Wilson : You're quite impressed with yourself right now, aren't you?
UNK: Greg House : Who wouldn't be?
UNK: Greg House : Well, that should be long enough.
UNK: Greg House : Back in a flash.
UNK: James Wilson : Take your time.
UNK: Greg House : Is my grandfather still here?
UNK: No.
UNK: Connie Walesa : He should be right back.
UNK: Irene Walesa : He just went to get some warm milk.
UNK: Greg House : But your mom's still here, right?
UNK: Irene Walesa : Yes, of course.
UNK: Greg House : I know she's fine, now, but when you were four or five, she got sick.
UNK: No.
UNK: Greg House : You sure? She wasn't in any pain?
UNK: Connie Walesa : I wasn't in pain.
UNK: No, she was just tired.
UNK: Irene Walesa : And sometimes she would stay in bed all day.
UNK: Greg House : Did she ever fall down?
UNK: Greg House : Of course.
UNK: Everyone falls down once in a while.
UNK: Irene Walesa : Sometimes, not that often.
UNK: Greg House : How often?
UNK: Connie Walesa : Maybe it was actually more than once in a while.
UNK: Connie Walesa : Remember that time in the bathroom?
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Irene Walesa : A few times.
UNK: Irene Walesa : Once she hit her head on the bathroom sink. There was blood all over the floor.
UNK: I got it on my sweater. I...
UNK: Irene Walesa : They took her away.
UNK: Greg House : Yeah, to the place where the doctor made her better.
UNK: Greg House : But before that, what about her arms and legs?
UNK: Greg House : Did she ever walk funny, like, sort of bent over?
UNK: Connie Walesa : I thought that was from growing up on the farm!
UNK: Greg House : What about her hands?
UNK: Did she ever have any difficulty sewing, buttoning a shirt?
UNK: No.
UNK: Connie Walesa : But sometimes my hands would shiver.
UNK: Connie Walesa : Like I was cold, but I wasn't. I never quite understood.
UNK: Irene Walesa : She used to get the shivers. Like she was cold.
UNK: Greg House : Start her on L-dopa and bromocriptine.
UNK: Greg House : It's just Parkinson's.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Cole, how's it going with your patient?
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : Still seeing stuff.
UNK: Allison Cameron : I hear House is treating you like crap.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : He treats everyone badly.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Yeah, but I heard you're special.
UNK: Well, I can handle it.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Maybe you shouldn't. He's gonna walk all over you if you let him.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : That says nothing about me, just him.
UNK: Allison Cameron : House respects people who aren't afraid of him.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Get in his face. Yell, if you have to.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : I don't need his respect.
UNK: Allison Cameron : You do if you want the job.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : Thanks for the advice.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : You have to hold still.
UNK: Irene Walesa : I'm trying!
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Damn! Hold her down!
UNK: No!
UNK: Stop it! Let me do it.
UNK: "thirteen" : No, no.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Hold her down!
UNK: "thirteen" : No! No!
UNK: No!
UNK: Irene?
UNK: Irene?
UNK: Irene Walesa : You stabbed me.
UNK: "thirteen" : You were having a nightmare. It wasn't real.
UNK: Irene Walesa : My arm is bleeding.
UNK: "thirteen" : No. It's okay now, your arm's not...
UNK: Amber Volakis : Lesions aren't explained by Parkinson's.
UNK: Greg House : Any theories?
UNK: What, ghost got your tongue?
UNK: "thirteen" : I'm fine.
UNK: Henry Dobson : What about vasculitis?
UNK: Chris Taub : MRI didn't indicate any cerebral ischemia.
