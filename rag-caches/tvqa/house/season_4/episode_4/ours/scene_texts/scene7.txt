UNK: Robert Chase : Spleen's ripe to bursting. You guys thought it was vasculitis?
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : You used to be on House's team, right?
UNK: Yeah. Got a lot of blood in here. Sponge.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : You got any advice for me?
UNK: Nope.
UNK: You always put up with his crap?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : Was it a mistake?
UNK: Robert Chase : It was irrelevant.
UNK: Well, he fired you.
UNK: Robert Chase : He'll fire you either way. Eventually.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : Dr. Cameron told me about... Don't want to know.
UNK: Why not? Because House is watching.
UNK: Robert Chase : Not a metaphor. Look up.
UNK: Greg House : You guys gonna shoot the breeze,
UNK: Greg House : or you gonna do something about all that bleeding?
UNK: Robert Chase : That's not coming from the spleen. It's the liver.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : It's necrotic.
UNK: Robert Chase : She's dying from the inside out.
UNK: Chris Taub : Enlarged spleen and liver failure are classic AIP.
UNK: Chris Taub : It's porphyria and it's moving fast.
UNK: Henry Dobson : PBGs were negative. If you read the reports...
UNK: Chris Taub : PBG tests are only conclusive if done during an attack,
UNK: Chris Taub : which you would know if you were a real doctor.
UNK: Greg House : That is just great.
UNK: What is? Which one of us is?
UNK: Greg House : Both of you. Together.
UNK: Greg House : Fighting. Passionate to prove the other one wrong.
UNK: Greg House : Couldn't care less about the patient, but it all works out the same.
UNK: I hate Thirteen.
UNK: Greg House : Not as productively. Continue.
UNK: Henry Dobson : It could still be vascular.
UNK: Chris Taub : Vasculitis is off the board.
UNK: Chris Taub : Steroid treatment didn't help.
UNK: Henry Dobson : Vascular isn't just vasculitis.
UNK: Something's got to be cutting off the blood supply to her liver and spleen.
UNK: Greg House : Do a visceral angiogram.
UNK: Chris Taub : This is a joke, right?
UNK: Chris Taub : He can't be right every single time.
UNK: Chris Taub : You're feeding him your ideas just to embarrass us.
UNK: Greg House : If I wanted to embarrass you, I'd have you mop up the doctors' lounge.
