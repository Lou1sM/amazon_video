UNK: Travis Brennan : All right. Who's up?
UNK: Chris Taub : Not me.
UNK: "thirteen" : You haven't done any digging yet.
UNK: Chris Taub : I'm a surgeon.
UNK: Chris Taub : If anything happens to these hands, I'm screwed.
UNK: Chris Taub : Let Bosley do it.
UNK: Chris Taub : As long as he can keep folding laundry,
UNK: Chris Taub : His career...
UNK: Henry Dobson : Someone's coming.
UNK: Hey, shouldn't we be running?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : If it's a cop, run.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Security guard, I say we take him down.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Sorry I'm late.
UNK: Chris Taub : Where the hell have you been?
UNK: Amber Volakis : I got lost.
UNK: We've been here over three hours.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Really lost.
UNK: Amber Volakis : I brought coffee and donuts.
UNK: So, Thirteen, you grow up around here?
UNK: "thirteen" : We're digging up a grave and you want to chit-chat?
UNK: Amber Volakis : I'm just making conversation. It's what people do.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Why are you hiding everything?
UNK: Amber Volakis : And I'm asking you that question because you're hiding everything.
UNK: Amber Volakis : There's something seriously wrong with you.
UNK: Amber Volakis : I'm worried.
UNK: "thirteen" : No, you're not.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Fine, but I am freaked, because I don't think you're a freak.
UNK: Amber Volakis : I think you're doing this on purpose because you know House will be intrigued.
UNK: "thirteen" : Yeah, I grew up around here.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Honey, I'm home.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Get the crowbar.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : No, there's not enough room to maneuver a crowbar down here.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Oh, God help us.
UNK: Greg House : What the hell?
UNK: Amber Volakis : What is it?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Ankles. They buried the guy the wrong way around.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : The doctors' lounge is covered in mud.
UNK: Greg House : Thirteen and Cutthroat Bitch had a disagreement.
UNK: Greg House : Cafeteria was out of Jell-O.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : There were pickaxes.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Either you had them dig up a body, or you're building a railroad.
UNK: Greg House : A little, tiny piece of his brain. Seemed a waste.
UNK: Greg House : He wasn't using it anymore.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : That's your defense?
UNK: "We just dismembered him. "
UNK: Greg House : They're looking for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You get the results yet?
UNK: Greg House : Does my breath smell bated to you?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Yes. Let me know when you hear anything.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : And get that mess in the shower area cleaned up.
UNK: Greg House : I know just the guy.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : How many of them agreed to dig up a grave?
UNK: Six. But don't worry, the one who didn't, didn't stand on principle.
UNK: Greg House : He just had a diaper to change.
UNK: Greg House : I really think there are no bad choices in this group.
UNK: Greg House : You guys don't wipe your feet when you come in the house?
UNK: Greg House : Doctors' lounge, let's go.
UNK: Chris Taub : Why me?
UNK: Greg House : Well, I can't ask the black guy or one of the chicks to do it.
UNK: Greg House : That would be insensitive.
UNK: Chris Taub : And you can't ask Bosley
UNK: Chris Taub : because that'd look like you only hired the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.
UNK: Greg House : You keep stalling, you're still gonna clean up,
UNK: Greg House : but I won't let you have the mop.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Sample came back negative for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
UNK: Greg House : Well, that discussion didn't last long.
UNK: Travis Brennan : I just don't know what else there is.
UNK: Travis Brennan : We had an idea, it was wrong.
UNK: Well, we could go home.
UNK: Greg House : I mean, we have no idea what's wrong with her,
UNK: Greg House : which means it could be completely benign.
UNK: Or, on the off chance that it's killing her, we could take it again from the top.
UNK: Irene Walesa : You've already done everything.
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : We may have missed something.
UNK: Irene Walesa : I just want to go home. I'm sure I'm fine now.
UNK: Connie Walesa : Reena, the doctors know best.
UNK: "thirteen" : You had some serious symptoms...
UNK: Irene Walesa : If I have another one, I'll come right back. Okay?
