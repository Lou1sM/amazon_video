UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I'll cut the salary of everyone else on the team 15%,
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : give it to you.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : That's more than you'll get anywhere else.
UNK: Eric Foreman : What does House say about this?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You're the one person on the team that he always respected.
UNK: This restaurant is 20 minutes out of your way, half an hour out of mine.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You picked it to make sure House didn't drop in on us.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : It's my decision, not his.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You tell him that, then run back to your office while I get to deal with him.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I left for a reason.
UNK: Eric Foreman : That reason hasn't changed.
UNK: So,
UNK: Greg House : what's the news?
UNK: Travis Brennan : Everything's negative so far.
UNK: Greg House : Yes. Why wait to finish before reporting to me?
UNK: Greg House : I have things to do, you know.
UNK: Amber Volakis : She's seeing someone else.
UNK: That's not news, that's olds.
UNK: Damn it. Why did God design the human body this way?
UNK: Amber Volakis : A guy in a wheelchair.
UNK: In a hospital? That's enough to give you the heebie-jeebies.
UNK: Amber Volakis : He had a dog. She's seeing Stark, our last patient.
UNK: Greg House : Well, if it's Stark, he wouldn't be haunting a patient,
UNK: Greg House : he'd be haunting the doctor who killed him.
UNK: "thirteen" : She probably just overheard someone talking about it, or...
UNK: Probably?
UNK: Greg House : You think there's a possibility that the alternative is true?
UNK: No. Then go away.
UNK: We're wasting time. We ran 32 gels, we could run 100 more.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Without knowing how her mother died...
UNK: You're gonna have to run 100 more.
UNK: Greg House : By you, of course,
UNK: Greg House : I'm only referring to the people who care enough about human life
UNK: Greg House : to put in a full day.
UNK: You want to carpool?
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : How do you expect me to respond to this stuff?
UNK: Greg House : Exactly like you just did.
UNK: Greg House : I have a theory. Maybe you can help me out.
UNK: Greg House : Black Mormon means masochist, means kinky.
UNK: Greg House : I'm thinking that someone got hurt making the bastard. Am I right?
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : You leave my son out of this.
UNK: Greg House : I wasn't referring to your kid's hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.
UNK: Henry Dobson : Why don't we just ask her how she died?
UNK: Amber Volakis : Because she won't tell us. She thinks her mother's still alive.
UNK: Henry Dobson : I don't mean ask the patient. I mean, ask her mother.
UNK: Cool.
UNK: Greg House : Come on.
UNK: Chris Taub : What the hell does that mean?
UNK: Chris Taub : You guys talking your own language now?
UNK: Henry Dobson : I'm sorry. I'll try to include some visual aids next time.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Now, what?
UNK: I'm Dr. House. Is your mom around?
UNK: Irene Walesa : Why should I tell you?
UNK: You're just gonna tell me I'm lying or crazy.
UNK: I'm not gonna do that. I really need to know what she has to say.
UNK: Irene Walesa : What do you want?
UNK: Greg House : When you were young, was she...
UNK: Irene Walesa : No, not you. Him.
UNK: "thirteen" : The man in the wheelchair?
UNK: Irene Walesa : No. He's old.
UNK: Irene Walesa : Actually, looks like you.
UNK: Greg House : Yeah, that's Grandpa House.
UNK: Tell him to call back on a landline.
UNK: Greg House : Terrible reception in here.
UNK: Greg House : How much pain was your mom in?
UNK: Old Gentleman : It's Walter.
UNK: Irene Walesa : He says his name is Walter.
UNK: Irene Walesa : Can I help you?
UNK: Greg House : My patient's talking to my Grandpa Walt.
UNK: James Wilson : You have a Grandpa Walt?
UNK: Nope.
UNK: Greg House : Which is what made me suspect
UNK: Greg House : that maybe she's not actually seeing into the afterlife.
