UNK: And I call you "Greg" because we're now social equals.
UNK: I call you "Cutthroat Bitch. " Well, quod erat demonstrandum.

UNK: Amber Volakis : I assume you'd like to join us?

UNK: Amber Volakis : Excuse me.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : No, no. I...
UNK: Amber Volakis : We've been waiting for...
UNK: Any minute now, she's going to hit him in the face with your testicles.
UNK: She tends to treat... She tends to treat every event
UNK: James Wilson : like it's the last 'copter out of Saigon.
UNK: Greg House : She's the anti-Wilson. She's a force for evil.
UNK: James Wilson : She has an annoying quality. Perhaps even two.
UNK: James Wilson : If I was perfect, I would date perfect.
UNK: Greg House : You like that.
UNK: James Wilson : It's annoying, but she's good at it.
UNK: Greg House : Wait a second.

UNK: Greg House : You like that she can humiliate someone if it serves...
UNK: Greg House : Oh, my God.
UNK: Greg House : You're sleeping with me.
UNK: Chris Taub : I need you to go faster, Roz.
UNK: A little harder.
UNK: I am going harder, damn it.
UNK: Yonatan Arnoff : What if Dr. House was right?
UNK: Yonatan Arnoff : And Roz did make a radical change.
UNK: Chris Taub : Lupus is chronic, but treatable.
UNK: Yonatan Arnoff : And with the treatment, it would undo the change?
UNK: Yonatan Arnoff : She'll be the way she was before I knew her?

UNK: Yonatan Arnoff : Well, you should love her more.
UNK: Yonatan Arnoff : The more you know someone, the more you should love them.
UNK: Chris Taub : Okay. That's enough, Roz.
UNK: Chris Taub : Your heart's as strong as a battleship.
UNK: Yonatan Arnoff : Does this mean Dr. House was wrong?
UNK: Roz Viner : Oh! Oh, my leg!
UNK: Eric Foreman : Heart's strong enough to prove you wrong about the change in mental status.
UNK: Greg House : Only proves this isn't lupus,
UNK: Greg House : just as the leg pain proves it isn't Wegener's.
UNK: Leg pain could be from nerve entrapment. We're thinking blood clot.
UNK: Greg House : Do an MRI to look for the clot. Then do an FMRI.
UNK: Eric Foreman : An MRI alone will detect...
UNK: Greg House : If the clot hasn't dissolved.
UNK: An FMRI could show signs of a near-ischemic stroke
UNK: Greg House : in post-ischemic parts of the brain.
