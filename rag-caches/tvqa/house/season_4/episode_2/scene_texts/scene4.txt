House : Not interesting.
House : Someone who looked like someone I used to know walked by my office.
Wilson : It's always interesting when repressed guilt starts unrepressing itself.
House : The only thing I feel guilty for is this.
UNK: We're gonna feed this endoscope down your esophagus,
UNK: 26 : try to find where your heart might be damaged.
UNK: It's gonna feel uncomfortable, but just keep swallowing,
UNK: 26 : I promise you'll be fine.
UNK: 13 : She's ready.
UNK: 26 : Go ahead, take a whack.
UNK: 2 : Right, so if we don't find anything, House blames me.
UNK: 26 : Or you find something and get a gold star.
UNK: Why don't you wanna do it?
UNK: House isn't gonna be impressed by a gray hair doing his ten-thousandth echo.
UNK: 13 : So, you're just being altruistic?
UNK: 26 : That makes you suspicious, Doctor...
UNK: 13 : Call me 13. I'm not getting invested.
UNK: 2 : Her heart's structurally sound.
UNK: 2 : No clots, no valvular defects, no wall motion abnormalities.
House : Got that from structurally sound.
UNK: What did she say? Structurally sound.
House : I assume you're not all walking with me to tell me you found nothing...
UNK: 2 [still Walking Backwards In Front Of House] : It showed a short burst in the...
House : Okay. Who's next?
UNK: 2 [still Walking Backwards In Front Of House] : It showed a short burst of atrial flutter.
UNK: 13 [moves In Front Of House] : I ran a rhythm strip twice and got the same result.
UNK: Stop.
House : Okay, here's how we diagnose in transit.
House : I lead, you draft, I move, you move, I stop, you stop. Got it?
UNK: 13 : Flutter could mean hormone overproduction...
UNK: Wait a second. Why did you do the test? I gave it to Scooter.
UNK: We didn't think it mattered. It doesn't.
House : It matters that you let her.
House : Okay, 10, 24, 39, run a TRH stimulation test for hyperthyroidism.
UNK: 2 : That could cause another heart attack.
House : Proving her first attack was caused by her thyroid,
House : which is kind of the point, right?
UNK: Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
House : I ride alone.
UNK: The hormones stimulate your thyroid.
UNK: 39 : Don't worry if you get flushed or you start to sweat.
UNK: 39 : It means the thyroid's working.
UNK: 39 : And, if you want, I can remove that mole.
UNK: 39 : I'm a plastic surgeon. You're allowed a little vanity.
Greta : I'm fine with the way I look.
UNK: 39 : Good for you.
UNK: 39 : Although, I do find it a bit odd that someone so self-assured
UNK: 39 : doesn't want her doctors to find out what's wrong with her.
Greta : What are you talking about? Why else am I here?
UNK: 39 : You're jerking us around. You're handcuffing us with all these restrictions.
Greta : I'm feeling warm.
UNK: 10 : Her pulse is 120. Stop pushing.
UNK: 10 : If House thought this would handicap us, he wouldn't have taken the case.
UNK: 39 : Or maybe that's why he took the case.
UNK: 39 : He wants to see if we can get it out of her on our own.
UNK: What did you find at her home?
UNK: You were in my home? Nothing.
UNK: Travel pictures, yearbook, her name on an employment slip?
UNK: 10 : We weren't checking for that stuff, okay?
UNK: 10 : Obviously, House didn't want us to.
UNK: You're gonna... You're gonna out me, aren't you?
UNK: You're gonna ruin everything.
UNK: 39 : Nobody's trying to do anything, just relax.
UNK: 24 : This is not a normal response to the test. Pulse and BP are too high.
Greta : Get away from me.
Greta : Get away from me! Don't touch me!
