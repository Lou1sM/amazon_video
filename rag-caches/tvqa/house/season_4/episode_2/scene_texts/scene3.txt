UNK: 18 [quietly To 24.] : You're working that thing all the time. Is everything all right?
UNK: 18 [quietly To 24.] : We're supposed to be watching her heart rate and blood pressure.
UNK: 24 : Yeah, I was until you pulled me over here.
UNK: 24 : I'm sending out a consult on another patient.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: 24 : What? I'm not quitting my old job until I'm sure I've got a new one.
UNK: I didn't say anything. You had a look.
UNK: 18 : Yeah, I did. Sorry.
UNK: 6 : Hey, I think she's having a heart attack.
Greta : No, I just feel a little funny.

UNK: Call the code!
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: V - fib. Where the hell is... Clear!
UNK: 18 : Are you crazy? You can't use those! We're in a hyperbaric...
UNK: Clear!
UNK: 18 : She's on fire!
UNK: 6 [smiling] : Her heart's beating.
UNK: 18 : And we are so fired.
UNK: 6 : We've started her on nitro and blood thinners.
UNK: 6 : Electrolytes and post-arrest EKG were normal.

House : or you thought he'd fail, making you a cutthroat little pixie.
UNK: What causes... Takayasu's syndrome.
UNK: 15b : Not without a rash and a fever. It's gotta be Whipple's.
UNK: 15a : No way. You ever see Whipple's without abdominal pain?
House : Stop it!
House : This argument is distracting every male and lesbian here.
House : You're both right.
House : In the sense that you've convinced me that you're both wrong.
UNK: 26 : What about cardiomyopathy?
UNK: 26 : Structural abnormality causes the heart attack
UNK: 26 : and throws clots to the brain, leading to synesthesia.
House : How old are you?
UNK: 26 : I'm 21, unless it's relevant.

House : The rest of you, go to the cafeteria.
House : Document 10 things that can cause infection, each.

House : 17's a stupid number.
House : What's Chase doing here?
Wilson : You saw Chase?
House : Last night. Outside my office.
House : That's interesting.

Wilson : It wasn't Foreman or Cameron you saw, but Chase, the one you fired.
