UNK: James Wilson : Dying's easy. Living's hard.
UNK: Greg House : That can't possibly be as poignant as it sounded.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Still can't find the drug source,
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : but I don't think that's the problem.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : The dimercaprol isn't working,
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : and Quidd volunteers at a home for abandoned kids.
UNK: Greg House : Why are you telling me this?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Because his bass player told me.
UNK: Greg House : Is it medically relevant?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: Well, then, why are you... Stop playing games and do your job.
UNK: No.
UNK: Greg House : This time I'm firing Taub and Amber.
UNK: Amber Volakis : This is a joke, right?
UNK: Greg House : It's only a joke if you come up with the answer.
UNK: Greg House : It's not really funny if you don't.
UNK: Thirteen and Kutner, you're fired, too.
UNK: Foreman? He's a druggie.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I was never sure there was a disease in the first place.
UNK: Greg House : So, all we know is that he's dying.
UNK: Greg House : Who wants to tell the patient?
UNK: Fine, I'll get some kid to go talk to him.
UNK: Greg House : It's the only people he gets along with anyway.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Are we still fired?
UNK: Greg House : He works with abandoned kids.
UNK: Greg House : Is it medically relevant?
UNK: Greg House : I think so.
UNK: Greg House : I need a brain biopsy.
UNK: Greg House : For the patient.
UNK: Greg House : You two switch.
UNK: You wanna drill into the skull of a patient
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : who almost died on the operating table yesterday?
UNK: Why are they here?
UNK: Greg House : Because I wouldn't have gotten the answer without each of them.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You could have just told me.
UNK: Greg House : I want you to feel guilty.
UNK: Greg House : She thinks the patient's a loser.
UNK: Greg House : She thinks the patient's a winner,
UNK: Greg House : just a regular guy with a regular problem.
UNK: Greg House : He thinks he's gonna be great once he's all grown up,
UNK: Greg House : and he thinks... What did you think?
UNK: Autoimmune. Right.
UNK: Greg House : Less interesting but just as important.
UNK: Amber Volakis : We can't all be right.
UNK: Greg House : You're all wrong.
UNK: Greg House : My mom always said that two wrongs don't make a right.
UNK: Greg House : She never said anything about four wrongs.
UNK: Greg House : I always found that suspicious.
UNK: Greg House : Plain old measles, constant exposure from
UNK: Greg House : hanging out with Oliver Twist and his lot.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I assume he's been vaccinated.
UNK: Greg House : Patient's immune system was shredded with years of drugs.
UNK: Greg House : Early markers of rash and fever
UNK: would have been lost on a druggie.
UNK: Greg House : His immune system overreacted,
UNK: which is why his body went haywire.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : That's clever.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You're not doing a biopsy without neurological symptoms.
UNK: Greg House : If I'm right, the virus is in his brain.
UNK: Greg House : Wrong course of treatment could be his last course.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I need a neurological...
UNK: Amber Volakis : He kept swallowing.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Could be neurological, could be a complex partial seizure.
UNK: Greg House : What did it look like?
UNK: Greg House : Good God, woman, how much more proof do you need?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : If you can induce a seizure, you can have your biopsy.
UNK: Hoes, hup!
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : We're gonna use flashing lights.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Noxious stimulation, it'll irritate your brain.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : If there's damage to your neurons,
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : it'll trigger a seizure. That way we can...
UNK: Greg House : I got something much more noxious.
