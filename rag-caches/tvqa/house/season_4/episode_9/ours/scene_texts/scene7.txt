UNK: Greg House : It's not whether you win or lose.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Respiratory failure and large lymph nodes.
UNK: Greg House : Whatever this is, he's not gonna be breathing much longer.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Does Foreman being here means the game's over?
UNK: Greg House : It means the patient's life is almost over.
UNK: Greg House : You can call it what you want.
UNK: Greg House : We're done, people. Come on!
UNK: I need ideas. I don't care who they come from.
UNK: Of course you do. This is still a game.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You're still gonna reward whoever gets the right idea, punish whoever's wrong.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Hire who you want. Get this over with.

UNK: "thirteen" : An immune overreaction would explain everything.
UNK: Greg House : Drug diagnosis.
UNK: Greg House : That's what you're going with?
UNK: That firing thing, it was all a dream.
UNK: Greg House : Go find where he gets his drugs and what's in them.
UNK: And put him on dimercaprol for heavy metal poisoning.
UNK: Greg House : Competition works.
UNK: Amber Volakis : So, you're not gonna tell me who sells you drugs?

UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Not really.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : I'm not an adult.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Never wanted to be.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : So, if the choice
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : is running out the clock with a walker,
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : and a bedpan...
UNK: Amber Volakis : You don't regret anything?
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Well, there was a lot of drugs,
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : a lot of drinking, a lot of fights.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : I regret everything else.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : You hate me, don't you?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Greg House : I don't care.
UNK: Amber Volakis : What's it like?
UNK: It means you have no regrets.
UNK: Kind of sticks in your head, doesn't it?
UNK: Greg House : This guy's amazing.
UNK: Greg House : There's not one redeeming note.
UNK: James Wilson : What sort of a lawyer tells his client
UNK: James Wilson : he's got a case because he's going to live?

UNK: James Wilson : I don't think this guy even has a law degree.
UNK: Well, the guys on TV don't, either.
UNK: James Wilson : I think he has a medical degree.
UNK: Greg House : It directly affects my bottom line.
UNK: If you have less money to lend...
UNK: James Wilson : I'm trying to take responsibility.
UNK: Greg House : And I'm trying to teach you that everyone is out for theirs.
UNK: Greg House : You might as well keep yours.
UNK: James Wilson : And lend it to you?
UNK: James Wilson : You have to control everything.
UNK: James Wilson : How come you're going around asking everyone who you should fire?
UNK: Greg House : I'm asking for input!
UNK: Greg House : I thought you would have admired the humility.
UNK: James Wilson : You like games because you can control them.
UNK: Greg House : God, I'm gonna put the record back on.
UNK: James Wilson : You like what's interesting, never mind if it's real or good.
UNK: You wanna know why you offered that guy six grand?
UNK: James Wilson : Life just happens, and that scares the hell out of you.
UNK: Greg House : You think you can cure pain.
UNK: James Wilson : You think you can avoid pain.
UNK: Greg House : You think you're responsible for every failure,
UNK: Greg House : every patient's boring life, every friend's screwed-up...
