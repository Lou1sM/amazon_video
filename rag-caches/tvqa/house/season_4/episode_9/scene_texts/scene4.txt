UNK: Greg House : Jimmy Quidd's greatest stiff. 1989.
UNK: James Wilson : A profit-seeking entity released this?
UNK: He put it out himself.
UNK: Greg House : He wanted people to listen, but apparently
UNK: Greg House : didn't want people to enjoy listening.
UNK: Greg House : Now, why would someone... Truly a mystery.
UNK: James Wilson : Why would anyone do something just to aggravate people?
UNK: Why would you have a blank liability release form
UNK: Greg House : plus your checkbook on top of your desk?
UNK: James Wilson : Probably because they were in the second drawer,
UNK: James Wilson : in a manila envelope, under a book,
UNK: James Wilson : and you put them on top of my desk.
UNK: Greg House : You usually keep your checkbook at home.
UNK: Greg House : It's your go-to excuse for why you can't lend me money.
UNK: Greg House : You're gonna pay the guy the six grand, aren't you?
UNK: James Wilson : There are other people I write checks to. I do have cable.
UNK: Greg House : There's no negligence without injury.
UNK: James Wilson : I handed the guy a death sentence.
UNK: Greg House : He's not distressed with the death sentence.
UNK: He's distressed with the life sentence.
UNK: James Wilson : I gave him three months of misery.
UNK: Greg House : You gave him three months of being someone special.
UNK: Greg House : You're paying the guy because he used to be boring,
UNK: Greg House : and without you, he's gonna be boring again.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Results of the malaria tests already?
UNK: Chris Taub : Well, no.
UNK: Chris Taub : But we were wondering if you'd sent the patient for any additional tests?
UNK: Greg House : You lost the patient.
UNK: Taub, you check lost and found. Thirteen, come with me.
UNK: Greg House : Why do you love drug addicts?
UNK: "thirteen" : I won't pigeonhole the patient, so that means I'm...
UNK: Greg House : Perfectly capable of drawing my own conclusions.
UNK: Greg House : Are you capable of answering a question?
UNK: "thirteen" : I think there's more to him than the drugs.
UNK: Greg House : Admirable, why?
UNK: "thirteen" : I need a reason for doing something admirable?
UNK: Greg House : There's always a reason.
UNK: Greg House : He's a patient. You don't know him. Why do you like him?
UNK: Greg House : Alcoholic parent? Druggie youth?
UNK: Greg House : There's no such thing as a saint without a past.
UNK: "thirteen" : Or a sinner without a future.
UNK: Greg House : What makes you so sure that drugs are a mask for something else?
UNK: "thirteen" : Drugs are always a mask for something else.
UNK: Greg House : That's the dumbest thing I've heard in my life.
UNK: Chris Taub : You really want this job?
UNK: Why, you think you can talk me into leaving?
UNK: Chris Taub : You're a person who likes her privacy,
UNK: Chris Taub : working for a man who needs to know everything.
UNK: Chris Taub : You're a person who cares about her patients,
UNK: working for a man who cares about games.
UNK: "thirteen" : I hear him.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Neither sleet, nor mail, nor dread of night.
UNK: Hold on.
UNK: "thirteen" : Malaria's not contagious.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Children, I bid you good night.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Which one of you guys sapped my powers?
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Was it you? Did you take my powers?
UNK: Or maybe it was you.
UNK: Jimmy Quidd : Well, no matter. See, I'm feeling stronger already.
UNK: "thirteen" : It's okay. It's okay. He's okay.
UNK: "thirteen" : Respiration's good. Pulse is solid.
UNK: Chris Taub : We need a lot of nurses in here!
UNK: Greg House : Dr. Cuddy, the face that launched a thousand long faces.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Get control of your patient.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Strap him to the bed if you have to.
UNK: I wanna keep all four.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You can have two.
UNK: Greg House : You don't get negotiation, do you?
UNK: Greg House : I say four, you say three. We finally settle on three-and-a-half,
UNK: Greg House : which would be good news for Taub.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You don't want four. You don't want three.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : But if I say three, you get to keep playing your game.
UNK: Greg House : Who would you pick?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Are you asking my opinion?
UNK: Greg House : If you have any absolute truths, that would be even better.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You never want my advice.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You spend your life trying to avoid my advice.
UNK: Greg House : You're a bureaucratic nightmare,
UNK: Greg House : you're a chronic pain in the ass,
UNK: Greg House : and you're a second-rate doctor at best.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Am I blushing?
UNK: But you do know this stuff.
UNK: Greg House : Can we get this over with?
