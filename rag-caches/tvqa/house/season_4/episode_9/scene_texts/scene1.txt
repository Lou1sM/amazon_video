UNK: Greg House : For thinking it makes a difference who goes first.
UNK: Greg House : Only one person can be right. What points?
UNK: Greg House : Can't have an objective system
UNK: Greg House : of measurement without numbers.
UNK: Greg House : You lose three for not knowing that.
UNK: Greg House : From now on, only the person holding this can treat or run tests.
UNK: Greg House : Wanted to give you the serpent staff with the poison axe-head,
UNK: Greg House : but I left it in my car.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : Thank you.
UNK: Don't need you. It's one thing to hire based on a game.
UNK: Don't need your lecture.
UNK: Eric Foreman : It's insane to treat based on a game.
UNK: Greg House : You're not taking the long view.
UNK: Eric Foreman : The one where we stuff another patient in a body bag?
UNK: No, if we're wrong, that'll come pretty fast.
UNK: Greg House : The long view is the one where we pick the best team,
UNK: Greg House : that way we can use all the bags we save for grocery shopping.
UNK: Greg House : You're not buying that argument, are you?
UNK: No.
UNK: Greg House : In which case, I'm back to my original position.
UNK: Greg House : Don't need you.
UNK: Greg House : What do you think of Amber?
UNK: James Wilson : I screwed up a diagnosis.
UNK: Greg House : You don't seem that upset by it.
UNK: I diagnosed a guy with adenocarcinoma three months ago.
UNK: James Wilson : Told him he had six months.
UNK: So, now you gotta tell him that he's way behind on his Christmas shopping?
UNK: James Wilson : He didn't get worse. I rechecked everything.
UNK: James Wilson : Biopsy was a false positive.
UNK: James Wilson : Harmless lesions caused by talc inhalation.
UNK: Greg House : Medical clemency.
UNK: Interesting.
UNK: James Wilson : Why would you use that word?
UNK: Greg House : Because I'm interested.
UNK: Greg House : When I'm interested, I describe the things
UNK: Greg House : that make me interested as interesting.
UNK: James Wilson : Most people would say good, possibly great.
UNK: James Wilson : Why aren't you able to just enjoy...
UNK: Greg House : Why aren't other people able to just be interested?
UNK: "thirteen" : Is he in there?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: "thirteen" : Why'd you go right for the drug theories?
UNK: Amber Volakis : If he had a history of shoving cancer into his veins,
UNK: Amber Volakis : I'd have guessed cancer.
UNK: "thirteen" : Okay. You're an idiot.
UNK: "thirteen" : Either that or you've decided you can trust a smoking addict
UNK: "thirteen" : alone in a bathroom with an oxygen tank.
UNK: James Wilson : I got your new test results back.
UNK: Greg House : Sorry I'm late.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : Who's your colleague?
UNK: James Wilson : Dr. House.
UNK: Greg House : Yes, Dr. Wilson.
UNK: James Wilson : I really don't need the consult.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : I know the prognosis.
UNK: Greg House : Apparently not.
UNK: James Wilson : Mr. McKenna, I can't believe I'm able to say this,
UNK: James Wilson : but you're cancer-free.
UNK: James Wilson : The biopsy looked like adenocarcinoma, but it wasn't.
UNK: James Wilson : Harmless lesions on your lungs. You're fine.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : I don't get it.
UNK: Cool. No, it's...
UNK: James Wilson : I know this must come as a shock,
UNK: James Wilson : but I've double-checked the labs.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : I just accepted an offer on my house.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : I've had three goodbye parties.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : I'm buying plane tickets to Venice.
UNK: Greg House : You can still use those if you're alive.
UNK: I have to pay a $6,000 broker commission on a house I'm not selling.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : Money I don't have.
UNK: Mr. Mckenna : Thank you for letting me know.
UNK: James Wilson : I would have thought the living would mean more than the expenses.
UNK: Greg House : It's not about the money.
