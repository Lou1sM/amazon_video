UNK: Greg House : Actually, I think there was some gin in it, too.
UNK: A hundred and fifty grams over six hours.
UNK: Chris Taub : It worked.
UNK: Eric Foreman : No, it didn't.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I told you, you can't cure polio.
UNK: It means either she's not cured or she never had it.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Since she's walking out of here, I tested her blood from admittance.
UNK: Eric Foreman : No polio.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Means Brennan screwed up the lab tests.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Or you screwed up your lab tests.
UNK: Amber Volakis : You must have. She got better.
UNK: Eric Foreman : So, it's relapsing and remitting. Maybe porphyria.
UNK: Well, that's a stretch.
UNK: Greg House : If she had porphyria, you'd have seen purple urine.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You think it's more likely he cured polio?
UNK: Well, they believe it.
UNK: Greg House : Her symptoms fit perfectly.
UNK: Any alternative is unbelievably convoluted.
UNK: Greg House : Some doctor would have to poison her with thallium so it looks like polio,
UNK: Greg House : then fake a lab test, then give her vitamin C
UNK: Greg House : and stop the poison so she magically gets better.
UNK: Actually, it is kind of doable, right?
UNK: Greg House : So, what do you think?
UNK: Shall we test her for thallium before you contact Stockholm?
UNK: "thirteen" : You poisoned her?
UNK: Greg House : The really shocking thing
UNK: Greg House : is that Foreman was right about the heatstroke.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Vitamin C cures polio. I've seen it.
UNK: Greg House : Yeah. In some bush clinic.
UNK: Greg House : You needed polio in a place with a proper lab.
UNK: Greg House : The only problem is that places with proper labs don't have polio.
UNK: Travis Brennan : There is no money in finding cures for diseases that only kill poor people.
UNK: Travis Brennan : This will make them do research.
UNK: Travis Brennan : What do you care if I faked a lab test,
UNK: Travis Brennan : if it saves a few thousand lives?
UNK: Travis Brennan : I did what I had to do.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Isn't that what you hired us for?
UNK: Greg House : Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.
UNK: Greg House : You're gonna quit.
UNK: Go on, get out of here.
UNK: Eric Foreman : So, you're just gonna let him go?
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: And I'm gonna let him get as far away as possible before you call the cops.
UNK: Greg House : Guy's a nut job.
UNK: Greg House : Who the hell did I leave in charge?
UNK: Foreman.
UNK: Greg House : There was a reason for that. Next time, listen to him.
UNK: Chris Taub : Where have you been? And don't say the CIA.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Greg House : By the way, one of my employees...
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Either you're gonna have to get someone from the CIA
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : to call and confirm your story,
UNK: or you're doing eight clinic hours and Wilson is doing 16.
UNK: Greg House : I was in the Hamptons.
UNK: Greg House : I was helping some rich hedge fund jerk treat his son's sniffles.
UNK: Greg House : Fascinating as that sounds.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : For your honesty, I will forgive your hours.
UNK: Greg House : Thank you.
UNK: No!
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : The only thing less likely than your helping the CIA
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : is your helping some rich guy in Long Island.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You're doing your hours and Wilson's.
UNK: Samira Terzi : I know how to kill a man with my thumb.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Who doesn't?
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: I'm gonna take you up on your offer.
UNK: Yeah?
UNK: Well, I live a couple of miles from here.
UNK: Samira Terzi : That's not the offer I meant.
UNK: Samira Terzi : I gave notice today.
UNK: Greg House : You said you were happy at the company.
UNK: Greg House : I lied.
UNK: Samira Terzi : Doubt you'll hold it against me.
UNK: I'll see you at 9 : 00 on Monday.
