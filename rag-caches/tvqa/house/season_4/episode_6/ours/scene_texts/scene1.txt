UNK: No.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Abnormal deep tendon reflex.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Really? Let me see.
UNK: It's there. I didn't say it wasn't there,
UNK: Travis Brennan : I said it was abnormal.
UNK: Eric Foreman : We're gonna give you an MRI to be sure,
UNK: Eric Foreman : but I'm guessing your symptoms were caused by just dehydration in the heat.
UNK: Casey Alfonso : You're guessing?
UNK: Casey Alfonso : Look, I make a living driving 300 miles an hour,
UNK: Casey Alfonso : which makes the ability to stay conscious kind of important.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I'm sure it's just heatstroke,
UNK: Eric Foreman : but we're gonna do an MRI to be extra careful.
UNK: Agent Smith : You said you left your cell in your office.
UNK: Greg House : I lied.
UNK: Agent Smith : I wasn't going to take it.
UNK: Agent Smith : Just tell you to turn it off for take-off.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I know.
UNK: I just wanted to see if you could tell that I was lying.
UNK: Useful information. Yeah?
UNK: Eric Foreman : Where are you?
UNK: Greg House : I'm on a top-secret mission for the CIA.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Eric Foreman : There was nothing on your race car driver's CT
UNK: Eric Foreman : and the history and physical were normal.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Her deep tendon reflexes seemed a bit weak to me.
UNK: Areflexia could mean Miller Fisher.
UNK: Yes, areflexia could mean Miller Fisher,
UNK: Eric Foreman : but since the reflex was weak, not absent, it doesn't mean anything.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I'm releasing her. You can go back to your poker game.
UNK: Greg House : Poker's illegal.
UNK: The CIA would never allow illegal activity.
UNK: Have you considered Miller Fisher?
UNK: Eric Foreman : Why? What happened?
UNK: She just had another seizure. And now she's getting a vertical nystagmus.
UNK: We think it's Miller Fisher, an inflammatory process.
UNK: Eric Foreman : In rare cases, it can cause respiratory failure, but...
UNK: Wait, wait. She could stop breathing?
UNK: Casey Alfonso : You said there was nothing wrong. You said you were sure.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You just had another seizure. Clearly there's something wrong.
UNK: Casey Alfonso : So, why should I trust you to figure out what it is?
UNK: Casey Alfonso : Where's Dr. House? I'm at this hospital...
UNK: Eric Foreman : It's gonna be all right.
UNK: Eric Foreman : We just need to start the plasmapheresis.
UNK: No.
UNK: Casey Alfonso : It's not going to be all right,
UNK: Casey Alfonso : because you obviously don't have a clue what you're doing.
UNK: Casey Alfonso : I'm not letting you touch me.
UNK: Honey!
UNK: Casey Alfonso : I wanna see House. Where is he?
UNK: It looks a lot better on 24.
UNK: Greg House : I take that back.
UNK: Samira Terzi : Dr. Samira Terzi. It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. House.
