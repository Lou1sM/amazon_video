UNK: Samira Terzi : Vitals stabilizing.
UNK: Tummy ache's gone as well.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : So, the treatment's working.
UNK: You wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy and hop on the company jet?
UNK: Greg House : Little trip down Mexico way,
UNK: Greg House : and I'm not talking about the country or the plane.
UNK: Samira Terzi : Do you think acting like an idiot and talking about sex works on girls?
UNK: Greg House : Well, if it didn't, the human race would have died out long ago.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : You're pretty cheery for someone
UNK: Sidney Curtis : who was just proved wrong about his pancreatitis theory.
UNK: Greg House : I'm appropriately cheery for someone who's been proved right.
UNK: Samira Terzi : John hasn't vomited in six hours.
UNK: What's to vomit? I'm eating his lunch.
UNK: Greg House : Withholding nutrients is the treatment for pancreatitis.
UNK: Greg House : That, and the antibiotics you put him on.
UNK: Greg House : I did unhook your iodine, though.
UNK: Greg House : Didn't seem to fit with the whole "I'm just jerking you guys around" Gestalt.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : You're unbelievable.
UNK: Greg House : Let's ask John if he'd rather be sick honestly or cured dishonestly.
UNK: Samira Terzi : John? John?
UNK: Greg House : Any chance he's just overwhelmed with gratitude?
UNK: Paralysis.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : It's a new symptom?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Big white space on the board where it would fit.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Nice, multicolored markers.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I'm not writing it because we can't know if it's a real symptom.
UNK: Eric Foreman : When these two went rogue and pumped her full of steroids, we lost...
UNK: Chris Taub : Steroids don't cause paralysis.
UNK: Eric Foreman : She was also on interferon.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Giving her both probably fried her immune system.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Who knows what infection you could cause...
UNK: Amber Volakis : We consulted an immunologist, she said we have...
UNK: Eric Foreman : She? You talking about Dr. Cameron?
UNK: Chris Taub : She thought lupus was... She tell you to start treating?
UNK: "thirteen" : Yes! They've ignored you, they screwed up
UNK: "thirteen" : and it's fun watching you spank them.
UNK: "thirteen" : But, can we get back to the medicine?
UNK: Eric Foreman : The last thing any of you give a damn about is the medicine.
UNK: Look.
UNK: Eric Foreman : I'm not saying you're bad doctors or bad people.
UNK: Eric Foreman : But House is.
UNK: Eric Foreman : He created a nasty little cutthroat world,
UNK: Eric Foreman : planted you in it, and is watching you play.
UNK: Eric Foreman : And none of it works for anyone except him.
UNK: Amber Volakis : And whoever wins.
UNK: Chris Taub : Given its quick progression, we gotta assume botulism.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : I'll go to her place. Check out her fridge and pantry.
UNK: Travis Brennan : It's not botulism. It's polio.
UNK: Chris Taub : Brilliant. We should search her home for FDR's remains or a time machine.
UNK: Travis Brennan : She could have contracted it from anyone who's been to Africa, or...
UNK: Amber Volakis : She's been vaccinated.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Vaccines wear off.
UNK: "thirteen" : There hasn't been a single American case in over 20 years.
UNK: Travis Brennan : I've seen this disease. I know what it looks like.
