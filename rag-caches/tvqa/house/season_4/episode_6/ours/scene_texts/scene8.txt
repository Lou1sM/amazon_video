UNK: Travis Brennan : Now what, boss?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Where's House?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : He's blown off four hours of clinic.
UNK: James Wilson : He's consulting for the CIA.
UNK: James Wilson : Seriously, call Langley,
UNK: and ask for extension three, five... It's three, five, three, six?
UNK: It's definitely two threes.
UNK: James Wilson : I wrote it down. I have it somewhere.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : He's gonna make up twice his skipped hours in the clinic.
UNK: Okey-doke.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : And for protecting him, you're gonna make up twice that.
UNK: James Wilson : Why are you punishing me worse than him?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Because House never learns. You might.
UNK: Greg House : How are you feeling?
John : Like crap.
UNK: Greg House : Yeah. Cancer can be that way.
John : My hair is falling out.
UNK: Is that the chemo?
UNK: No, that's too quick.
John : So, what does it mean?
UNK: Greg House : It means you don't have cancer.
UNK: Greg House : Someone actually did try to kill you.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : You're stubborn. You're arrogant!
UNK: Greg House : There's no need to yell.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : You may have cost that man his life.
UNK: Greg House : He's getting the radiation treatment.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : Twenty-four hours too late.
UNK: Greg House : I didn't yell at you when I thought you were wrong.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : I wasn't wrong.
UNK: Samira Terzi : This isn't productive.
UNK: There is no "productive," it's too late!
UNK: Sidney Curtis : Because of your inexperience, your poor judgment
UNK: Sidney Curtis : and your failure to recognize a reckless fool.
UNK: Greg House : Cordyceps sinensis.
UNK: Greg House : It's an herbal treatment derived from a parasitic fungus.
UNK: Greg House : Comes from caterpillars.
UNK: Greg House : Along with dimercaprol chelation,
UNK: Greg House : it's been shown to mitigate bone marrow damage
UNK: Greg House : from radiation poisoning
UNK: Greg House : in monkeys.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Sorry. I was stubborn and arrogant.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Self-recriminations won't help her.
UNK: "thirteen" : Nothing's gonna help her, she's got polio.
UNK: Amber Volakis : There's no cure, but there are treatments.
UNK: No, she's dying.
UNK: Chris Taub : Yeah, every death's a tragedy.
UNK: Chris Taub : Funny how you weren't so depressed
UNK: Chris Taub : when she was just dying because me and Amber screwed up.
UNK: Eric Foreman : And I'm also self-centered, thanks for clarifying.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Don't forget self-pitying.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Vitamin C. Extremely high doses.
UNK: Travis Brennan : It was experimental treatment protocol in the '50s...
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : And they haven't finished yet?
UNK: Travis Brennan : They lost funding.
UNK: Eric Foreman : That's because there's no logical reason vitamin C would cure polio.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Well, someone thought there was.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Someone thought black people made excellent farm implements.
UNK: Travis Brennan : I'm not talking about hurting anyone.
UNK: I just want to force-feed her some orange juice.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You wanna throw in some bacon and eggs as well?
UNK: If there's anything you learned today,
UNK: Travis Brennan : it's gotta be that you can be wrong.
UNK: Samira Terzi : John, can you hear me?
UNK: We're gonna start you on an experimental treatment.
UNK: Tea?
UNK: Greg House : It's a Chinese herb which has been effective.
John : I'm dying, aren't I?
UNK: Probably.
UNK: Travis Brennan : We're gonna attempt an experimental protocol.
UNK: Lou Alfonso : A new drug?
UNK: Travis Brennan : An old one. Vitamin C.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Ultra-high doses have been shown
UNK: Travis Brennan : to destroy the polio virus and heal nerve damage.
UNK: Lou Alfonso : She could regain use of her legs?
UNK: Eric Foreman : It's unlikely.
UNK: Travis Brennan : But we're gonna try.
UNK: Travis Brennan : Don't give up.
John : Nausea's not as bad.
UNK: Greg House : Radiation sickness has a latency period.
UNK: Greg House : You'll get better before you get worse.
John : Wanna know what I really did down there?
UNK: Greg House : Only if it's interesting.
John : The women there,
John : during Carnival, they...
John : They do this dance.
John : They call it the devil dance.
UNK: Greg House : Not interesting.
