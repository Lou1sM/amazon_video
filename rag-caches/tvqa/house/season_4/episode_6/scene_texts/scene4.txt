UNK: Samira Terzi : We've run six complete tox screens,
UNK: Samira Terzi : tested for every heavy metal, poison and biological agent we can think of.
UNK: It says here he ate a lot of chestnuts.
UNK: Hold on a second.
UNK: Greg House : If the squirrel liberation army is involved, I'm out of here.
UNK: Greg House : Those little rodents are...
UNK: Sidney Curtis : Horse chestnuts are poisonous. If someone switched them...
UNK: Greg House : Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts,
UNK: Greg House : but they taste like a horse's lower than chestnuts,
UNK: Greg House : which makes the theory that he accidentally ate a couple of hundred
UNK: Greg House : slightly less persuasive.
UNK: Greg House : Seeing as how he was prowling the back alleys of Tehran...
UNK: Samira Terzi : It wasn't Tehran, it was...
UNK: Samira Terzi : You almost got me.
UNK: Greg House : Unless we know the local environmental factors, the poisonous flora...
UNK: Samira Terzi : You know I can't tell you that.
UNK: Greg House : Well, then why are we here? You might as well just Google "poison. "
UNK: All they would tell me is he spent the last 11 months in Bolivia.
UNK: Greg House : Who you gonna kill in Bolivia? My old housekeeper?
UNK: Samira Terzi : We don't kill people.
UNK: Greg House : I'm sorry, who are you gonna marginalize?
UNK: Greg House : If it is my housekeeper, she has it coming.
UNK: Greg House : Cleaning the windows means cleaning both sides.
UNK: Greg House : Am I right or am I right?
UNK: Sidney Curtis : What does it matter what he was doing?
UNK: The guy's dying. Not anymore.
UNK: Greg House : I know what's poisoning him, and who.
UNK: John.
UNK: Greg House : It's just pancreatitis.
UNK: Samira Terzi : He's not an alcoholic.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : And unless his pancreas is in his fingers...
UNK: Greg House : Spies can't get fungal infections?
UNK: Samira Terzi : And the burns on his skin?
UNK: Greg House : Spies can't get sunburns?
UNK: Greg House : Bolivia doesn't have sun?
UNK: Sidney Curtis : So, either we go with his theory of the non-drinking drunk,
UNK: Sidney Curtis : or he was poisoned by some group
UNK: Sidney Curtis : with the resources to make it completely untraceable,
UNK: Sidney Curtis : some customized isotope.
UNK: Samira Terzi : Let's treat for radiation poisoning.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : The iodine's to protect your thyroid. Antibiotics are to handle infections.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : Should start working in a couple of hours.
UNK: Greg House : We should celebrate with a beer or eight.
John : I don't drink.
UNK: Greg House : Oh, methinks he doth protest too much.
UNK: Sidney Curtis : He's deathly ill. Why would he lie about drinking?
UNK: Guilt over killing a man would make anyone hit the sauce.
UNK: Samira Terzi : We don't kill people.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Greg House : You just lie to your friends and family,
UNK: Greg House : establish false identities, trick people into betraying their country.
UNK: Greg House : He'd never cover up his drinking. He's too honest.
UNK: Greg House : Hey! Something I've always wanted to know.
UNK: Greg House : That poison lipstick that Ginger used to kiss Gilligan,
UNK: Greg House : why didn't that kill her?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Okay, drum roll!
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : LP is negative for meningitis.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Sorry, Cole.
UNK: Fat pad biopsy is... Wait for it...
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Negative for amyloidosis and Thirteen goes down!
UNK: Jeffrey Cole : Could we hurry this up? My son has...
UNK: Amber Volakis : Can I have a kid, too? I'm working too hard.
UNK: Chris Taub : I could hook you up.
UNK: Amber Volakis : If I had two minutes and some anti-nausea meds,
UNK: Amber Volakis : I'd take you up on that.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : And for the gold...
UNK: Protein's 65, glucose, 70.
UNK: Eric Foreman : It's MS, start her on interferon.
UNK: Now, turn to the last page.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Sed rate's 95, ANA's weakly positive.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Positive, it's lupus.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Weakly, not lupus. It's MS.
UNK: Chris Taub : We obviously don't know what it is. Treat for both.
UNK: No. I gave in on the tests.
UNK: Eric Foreman : We're not treating her for two completely separate diseases
UNK: Eric Foreman : because you think lupus will win you a prize.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Still think it's lupus?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Me, too.
UNK: Amber Volakis : In case of emergency, go to the emergency room.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Could be lupus.
UNK: Amber Volakis : That's what we figured.
UNK: Allison Cameron : Then why are you here?
UNK: Chris Taub : You're an immunologist. We wanted to confirm...
UNK: Allison Cameron : Who are you looking for me to help you sell down the river? House or Cuddy?
UNK: Foreman.
UNK: Sorry. He's pushing MS.
UNK: Chris Taub : Thinks that because he's in charge,
UNK: Chris Taub : he has to prove he's the smartest guy in the room.
UNK: All I've heard about you, you put the patient above everything else.
UNK: That's why everyone finds you so annoying.
UNK: Allison Cameron : All House cares about is results. I know.
UNK: Chris Taub : I'm talking about how to deal with Foreman.
UNK: Allison Cameron : So am I.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Fever's down to 101.5.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Treatment's working. Why are we out here?
UNK: Chris Taub : Trying to figure out which treatment's working.
UNK: Chris Taub : It's kind of tacky doing it in front of the patient.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You put her on steroids, too?
UNK: Amber Volakis : We had no choice.
UNK: Amber Volakis : The sed rate pointed to lupus.
UNK: Eric Foreman : And the ANA ruled it out!
UNK: Doctors!
UNK: Eric Foreman : Legs hurt?
UNK: Casey Alfonso : I can't feel them at all. I don't think I can move them.
