UNK: 31?
House : Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that either way was good with you.
House : Taub and Thirteen, MRI for tumors, EEG for nerve damage
UNK: and test whatever comes out of him for everything else.
Chase : Too much axis tilt.
Chase : Don't release until your thumb's at the bottom of the ball.
Chase : I assume Wilson was busy.
UNK: Again.
Chase : No axis tilt.
Chase : With Amber?
UNK: Again.
Chase : Still. It was nice of you to invite me. This is fun.
House : No, it wasn't. No, it isn't.
House : I didn't invite you to be nice, I invited you
House : because bowling isn't one of the two things guys do by themselves.
Chase : What's the second thing?
House : Other hand.
Chase : Well, if people are incapable of being nice, why bother having the word?
House : The ontological proof of niceness.
House : The existence of the word proves the existence of the concept.
House : Look out for those minotaurs on your drive home.
UNK: And I thought motives don't matter, only results mattered.
UNK: So what are you gonna do?
Chase : To screw up Wilson's relationship so you don't have to listen to me
Chase : while you bowl.
House : I wish the best for them, and their tragically deformed children.
Chase : She's good at being bad.
Chase : You might not be able to destroy her.
House : As long as I give it my best shot, I can hold my head high.
Chase : Cameron had this one insufferable friend.
Chase : She wasn't going to get rid of her, and I sure wasn't going to join them.
UNK: So I just said, "See her on Thursdays. "
Chase : I know it's not as exciting as an exploding birthday cake,
Chase : but, hell, I don't want to hang out with her every night anyway.
House : That's amazing. Cameron only has one insufferable friend?
