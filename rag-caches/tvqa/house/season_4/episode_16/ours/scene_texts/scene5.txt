UNK: Chris Taub : Looks like an influenza rash.
UNK: Eric Foreman : The flu wouldn't be killing the organs one by one.
UNK: Dermatomyositis.
UNK: Greg House : Wouldn't speed up her heart.
UNK: "thirteen" : Maybe it's an allergic reaction to the interferon?
UNK: Yes, the symptom I saw on the bus was a rare interferon allergy
UNK: Greg House : that flares up two days before you take it.
UNK: How'd you see the rash down there?
UNK: Greg House : I don't know. Maybe she leaned over.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Maybe it's not a rash at all. Could be an abscess.
UNK: Thirteen, stick a needle in there.
UNK: Greg House : If there's pus, Foreman's right.
UNK: "thirteen" : Ultrasound is safer.
UNK: Greg House : I'm not asking you to stick a needle all the way through her.
UNK: Taub, you do it. No. Wait, I can do it.
UNK: Greg House : No, apparently, you can't.
UNK: Chris Taub : It's not fluctuant.
UNK: Chris Taub : Clear, it's not pus.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Means it's vesicular.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
UNK: James Wilson : We had dinner with a friend last week. We walked their dogs.
UNK: James Wilson : I guess she could've gotten a tick.
UNK: Eric Foreman : It's treatable, doxycycline.
UNK: Greg House : Allow eight hours for the antibiotics to take effect,
UNK: Greg House : then we warm her up, shock her heart.
UNK: James Wilson : Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
UNK: James Wilson : If we're wrong, restarting her heart could kill her.
UNK: James Wilson : Run blood cultures first.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Fastest way to test is to treat.
UNK: Eric Foreman : If we're wrong, still should give us time to try something else.
UNK: James Wilson : We are not starting her heart until we're 100% certain.
UNK: We're never 100% certain.
UNK: Greg House : Run the blood cultures.
UNK: Greg House : After we get confirmation, we'll restart her heart.
UNK: Eric Foreman : He's wrong. And you know he's wrong.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You can't change your mind just because a family member starts crying.
UNK: Eric Foreman : They're always scared.
UNK: Greg House : I said run the blood cultures.
UNK: Greg House : Sorry. Wide stance.
UNK: "thirteen" : You're right.
UNK: "thirteen" : I'm screwing up.
UNK: Greg House : Why are you screwing up?
UNK: "thirteen" : I didn't even like her.
UNK: Greg House : Did you hate her?
UNK: "thirteen" : Not enough to want her dead.
UNK: So it's not guilt. That just leaves fear.
UNK: A young woman dying.
UNK: A young doctor dying, in fact. That sound familiar?
UNK: "thirteen" : Yeah, I'm at risk for Huntington's.
UNK: "thirteen" : I've dealt with it.
UNK: Greg House : By not getting tested.
UNK: Greg House : Dealing with it by not dealing with it.
UNK: Greg House : It's clearly working beautifully.
UNK: "thirteen" : You're the champion of not dealing with your problems.
UNK: Greg House : My grandson gave me a mug that says that.
UNK: Greg House : Okay. Enough hand-holding.
UNK: Greg House : Deal with it, get back in there, or pack up your stuff.
UNK: "thirteen" : You're screwing up this case worse than I am.
