UNK: Eric Foreman : House is gonna kill the patient.
UNK: James Wilson : What are you... What are you doing?
UNK: She's up to 80 degrees.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : We're gonna restart her heart.
UNK: James Wilson : No, you're not.
UNK: James Wilson : There's still time to undo this. Cool her back down.
UNK: Eric Foreman : You weren't taking the safe approach.
UNK: We've got to know if the antibiotics are working.
UNK: James Wilson : Her EEG's slowed.
UNK: Amber.
UNK: Amber.
UNK: James Wilson : Well done.
UNK: James Wilson : We still don't know what it is,
UNK: but you've just let it spread to her brain!
UNK: James Wilson : This is exactly what I said would happen. It's in her brain now.
UNK: The brain involvement gives us a new symptom.
UNK: James Wilson : That wouldn't be there if you hadn't...
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : It's where the disease was going.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : We needed to know that.
UNK: James Wilson : This was not your decision to make!
UNK: James Wilson : You went behind my back. You went behind House's back.
UNK: Greg House : Inside voices.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : House wanted to warm her up.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You just guilted him into changing his mind.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Heart, liver, rash and now her brain.
UNK: Greg House : Auto-immune fits best. Crash trauma could've set it off.
UNK: Greg House : Start her on prednisone, then we'll warm her up again.
UNK: James Wilson : House, if this is some other infection,
UNK: James Wilson : the steroids will trash her immune system.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : He's the attending. You're the family.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Go spend more time with the patient.
UNK: James Wilson : You can't do this.
UNK: Greg House : That's not a good argument.
UNK: Greg House : It's not an argument at all. I'm sorry.
UNK: James Wilson : Cuddy's right. I was afraid to do anything.
UNK: James Wilson : I thought if everything just stopped, it would be okay.
UNK: Greg House : And it's gonna be.
UNK: Taub's starting treatment, we're doing everything...
UNK: James Wilson : Not everything.
UNK: James Wilson : Before you warm her up...
UNK: James Wilson : You said you wanted to try deep brain stimulation.
UNK: Greg House : But there's no reason.
UNK: Greg House : We know the symptom. We know what I saw.
UNK: James Wilson : What if it's not the rash?
UNK: What if you saw the rash in the ambulance,
UNK: James Wilson : or when we were putting her on bypass?
UNK: James Wilson : What if there is still something else stuck inside your head?
UNK: Greg House : You think I should risk my life to save Amber's.
UNK: I'm inserting the IPG probe into your ventral hypothalamus.
UNK: Give me 3 volts.
UNK: I can't hear him. Can't hear who?
