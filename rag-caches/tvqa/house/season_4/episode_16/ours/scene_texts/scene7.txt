UNK: Greg House : Everything's in black and white.
UNK: James Wilson : Who was talking? Is Amber there?
UNK: Greg House : You're supposed to be jolting my hypothalamus. Not petting it.
UNK: Robert Chase : We don't want to overload it.
UNK: Greg House : As long as I'm risking my life,
UNK: Greg House : I might as well be watching a talkie.
UNK: Increasing from 3 to 5 volts.
UNK: James Wilson : Sending impulse.
Bartender : You're not getting them back.
UNK: Greg House : Hey! You take my keys, you gotta give me a phone call.
UNK: James Wilson : Who are you calling?
UNK: Dial-a-Wilson.
UNK: James Wilson : I was on call.
UNK: James Wilson : Amber was home.
UNK: Greg House : I told her to find you, have you pick me up.
UNK: Greg House : I said to find Wilson.
UNK: Amber Volakis : He's working.
UNK: Amber Volakis : And I'm willing to suffer this indignity on his behalf.
UNK: James Wilson : Does she seem sick?
UNK: Greg House : Not yet.
UNK: Come on, time to go.
UNK: Greg House : Need another round and a drink for what passes for a lady around here.
UNK: Greg House : What's your poison? Nothing. We're leaving.
UNK: We're leaving, leaving, leaving. Cosmos.
UNK: Greg House : I remember Wilson buying cranberry juice.
UNK: Greg House : I'll have another, and she'll have a Cosmopolitan.
UNK: Amber Volakis : The obstinate drunk thing is not flattering.
UNK: Come on, you called for a ride.
UNK: Greg House : Drink your drink, or I'll drink them both.
UNK: One, and you leave voluntarily.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Let's go.
UNK: Hey! Need another Cosmo, here.
Bartender : She sneezed.
UNK: James Wilson : What color is it?
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Greg House : Looks like snot. Seems like a cold.
UNK: James Wilson : Nothing else?
UNK: No.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Where are you going?
UNK: You think I paid?
UNK: Amber Volakis : House, what are you doing? You can barely walk.
UNK: Greg House : Go home. I'll take the bus.
Bartender : Hey, someone's gotta pay for this.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Amber Volakis : You forgot something.
UNK: Boy, you don't give up, do you?
UNK: Amber Volakis : Yeah, I'm an idiot that way.
UNK: Greg House : You doing this for me, or for Wilson?
UNK: Greg House : For Wilson.
