UNK: Core temperature down to 90.
UNK: Robert Chase : Bypass circulating.
UNK: Robert Chase : She's stable.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Why are we doing this?
UNK: Greg House : Bought us time to think.
UNK: Greg House : The trauma must have stimulated a pre-existing heart condition.
UNK: Chris Taub : Auto-immune, congenital anomaly,
UNK: blood-clotting disorder, lead poisoning...
UNK: "thirteen" : Could be anything.
UNK: Greg House : Great. Let's explore that.
UNK: Greg House : Quick, get her on panacea.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : We can narrow it down by looking for arterial blockages.
UNK: Eric Foreman : How? On an echo?
UNK: Eric Foreman : Can't see wall motion when there's no motion.
UNK: Eric Foreman : EKG? Nope, heart's in the off position.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Thallium uptake scan? Useless on a cold heart.
UNK: Greg House : Yeah, we get it. Her heart's not beating.
UNK: Greg House : It's gonna make it harder to diagnose.
UNK: Greg House : On the other hand, she's not gonna die while you're whining about it.
UNK: Greg House : What else?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : There is another way to narrow it down.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : If you really did see a symptom in Amber before the crash,
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : physostigmine helped your memory last time.
UNK: Chris Taub : Why not cyanide? He's a mess, he needs to sleep.
UNK: Greg House : I had a heart attack this morning.
UNK: I can't do any more drugs till lunch.
UNK: Get her an angiogram. It could show damage even in a stopped heart.
UNK: Greg House : Rest of you, search her apartment.
UNK: Greg House : Toxins, heavy metals, drugs...
UNK: Greg House : Anything that might make her heart race.
UNK: Chris Taub : I need to know if there's anything medically relevant
UNK: Chris Taub : that you couldn't share publicly.
UNK: Greg House : Is this a Philanderers Anonymous intervention?
UNK: Chris Taub : You were obviously drinking last night.
UNK: Chris Taub : Maybe you took Amber to a bar?
UNK: Greg House : I left here on my motorcycle. Alone.
UNK: Chris Taub : You ended up drunk on a bus. Together.
UNK: Chris Taub : Maybe you met Amber in the bar?
UNK: Greg House : I was not having an affair with her.
UNK: Chris Taub : You can't really say that if you don't remember.
UNK: Greg House : I lost four hours, not four months.
UNK: Chris Taub : Maybe it was the first time.
UNK: Chris Taub : If you drank together, any chance you did any drugs?
UNK: Chris Taub : I'll run a tox screen.
UNK: You coming?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Correspondence. Letters to patients.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : She could have caught something from one of them.
UNK: "thirteen" : Copy it to a thumb drive. Let's get out of here.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Travel. Do you know if she's been out of the country recently?
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : It's just video clips. Maybe she narrates where they are.
UNK: James Wilson : And action!
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Looks like she didn't travel very far.
UNK: You look beautiful. You look nervous.
UNK: James Wilson : I've never done this before.
UNK: Amber Volakis : I have. Trust me. You'll love it.
UNK: Hey. Not even close to relevant.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : As long as we don't know what's wrong,
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : we don't know what's relevant.
UNK: "thirteen" : Yeah, maybe they're having sex on a pile of asbestos.
UNK: "thirteen" : Go watch it.
UNK: "thirteen" : If we were in a stranger's house,
UNK: "thirteen" : you'd be watching the video.
UNK: "thirteen" : You altered your behavior because you're friends with her.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Are you okay?
UNK: "thirteen" : We shouldn't be treating her at all.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : I'm gonna search her bathroom.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Are you okay?
UNK: Greg House : Can't really say "yes" when it's a hallucination asking.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Don't worry, you're just dreaming.
UNK: Greg House : What symptom did I see in you?
