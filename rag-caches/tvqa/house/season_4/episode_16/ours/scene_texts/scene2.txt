UNK: A myoclonic jerk. Boring.
UNK: Greg House : An incredibly rare neurological symptom is boring?
UNK: Greg House : Am I in someone else's subconscious?
UNK: Amber Volakis : What did we do last night?
UNK: Greg House : Was I meeting you for a drink?
UNK: Amber Volakis : Is that all it was?
UNK: Amber Volakis : A man thinks a woman is beautiful,
UNK: Amber Volakis : admires her intelligence,
UNK: Amber Volakis : admires the way she has to get whatever she wants.
UNK: Amber Volakis : The things he likes about himself.
UNK: And maybe she always had a little thing for him.
UNK: Amber Volakis : His mind, his blue eyes.
UNK: Amber Volakis : But someone gets between them.
UNK: Amber Volakis : So they decide to meet one night
UNK: Amber Volakis : at an out-of-the-way little bar...
UNK: Amber Volakis : Does that sound familiar?
UNK: Amber Volakis : Do I feel familiar?
UNK: Amber Volakis : What do you feel?
UNK: Electricity.
UNK: Electricity.
UNK: Greg House : I know I saw the symptom.
UNK: I know the memory is locked in my brain, now I know how to get it.
UNK: No.
UNK: Greg House : You don't even know what I'm talking about.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You need to rest.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I have yet to hear about any study linking electricity and rest.
UNK: Greg House : Deep brain stimulation.
UNK: Greg House : It's been proven.
UNK: Greg House : Electrical impulses applied directly to the hypothalamus
UNK: can evoke detailed memories.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : My mistake.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Drilling a hole
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : and shooting lightning bolts into an already cracked skull is very restful.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : It's not fatal at all.
UNK: James Wilson : She's right. You need to sleep.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Brain activity spiked.
UNK: Amber?
UNK: James Wilson : Amber? It's me.

UNK: Chris Taub : So was the tox screen.
UNK: James Wilson : That's what you found? Negative tests?
UNK: James Wilson : I could have told you she doesn't do drugs.
UNK: I found these in her apartment. Sorry.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : Prescription diet pills, SSRIs, amphetamines.
UNK: Chris Taub : Diet pills cause structural damage to the mitral valve,
UNK: Chris Taub : could explain the tachycardia.
UNK: James Wilson : She'd have to be an addict to take enough for her to damage her heart. I'd know.
UNK: Did you know she was hiding them in her vitamins?
UNK: Eric Foreman : We have to warm her back up, get her heart beating so we can do a CT to confirm.
UNK: James Wilson : No. We've been over this.
