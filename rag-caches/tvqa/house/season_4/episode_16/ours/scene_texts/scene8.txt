UNK: Greg House : Well, then, it's even more impressive.
UNK: Amber Volakis : Damn. Do you have a Kleenex?
UNK: Greg House : I got a sleeve.
UNK: Greg House : I got two, actually.
UNK: Gonna need more than that. I'm getting that nasty flu.
UNK: James Wilson : Is that it? The flu? Is there any rare complication?
UNK: No. It'll explain the rash, but nothing else.
UNK: Unless...
UNK: What?
UNK: Greg House : Don't do it.
UNK: Greg House : It wasn't the flu.
UNK: Greg House : It's what she did for it. She has amantadine poisoning.
UNK: James Wilson : The crash destroyed her kidneys,
UNK: James Wilson : her body couldn't filter the drugs,
UNK: James Wilson : she ODs on amantadine, explains the heart, the liver...
UNK: We just need to start on her dialysis and flush the drugs out.
UNK: James Wilson : What? What's wrong?
UNK: Greg House : Amantadine binds with proteins.
UNK: Greg House : Dialysis can't clear it out of the blood.
UNK: Greg House : There's nothing we can do.
UNK: Greg House : I'm so sorry.
UNK: Amber.
UNK: Amber.
UNK: He's seizing. Wilson! I need help, here.
UNK: Eric Foreman : House suffered a complex partial seizure.
UNK: Eric Foreman : The violent shaking widened his skull fracture, causing a brain bleed.
UNK: Eric Foreman : We won't know if there's any cognitive impairment
UNK: Eric Foreman : until he's out of the coma.
UNK: Eric Foreman : He was right about the amantadine.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Amber's body couldn't filter it out.
UNK: Eric Foreman : That's what caused her heart to beat too fast for too long.
UNK: Eric Foreman : It caused irreparable structural damage.
UNK: Eric Foreman : Didn't matter if they shocked her or froze her or...
UNK: Eric Foreman : Her heart was dead once it stopped in that ambulance.
UNK: Lawrence Kutner : What about a new heart? Transplant?
UNK: Eric Foreman : All of her organs are damaged. She can't qualify.
UNK: Greg House : There's nothing we can do. Nothing we could have done.
UNK: James Wilson : We should call time of death.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Technically, she's still alive.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Could probably survive a few more hours on bypass.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : We could wean her off anesthesia. Wake her up.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Give you a chance to...
UNK: James Wilson : It'd be cruel. Don't...
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Wake Amber up. See her again.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Tell her what she means to you.
UNK: James Wilson : Wake her up to tell her that she's...
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You are waking her up so that you can both say goodbye to each other.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : She would want it.
