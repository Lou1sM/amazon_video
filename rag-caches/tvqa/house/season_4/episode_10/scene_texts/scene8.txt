Kutner : A little harder.
UNK: Great.
Taub : Maggie? Open your eyes.
Maggie : Why aren't you saying anything?
Kutner : What's wrong?
Taub : Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis.
Kutner : But she's bleeding into her eyes, now.
House : Have her platelets dropped?
Kutner : Plummeted. New labs show they're under 40.
Kutner : She'll bleed out of every orifice if we don't find the cause.
Taub : Could be splenic sequestration, tuberculosis.
Thirteen : Gaucher disease, TTP.
UNK: Hemolytic-uremic syndrome, sepsis, lupus...

House : if you can do it reverse alphabetically.

Kutner : I'm your Secret Santa.
House : You're not supposed to tell.
Kutner : But you got a present already,
Kutner : which means you have more than one Secret Santa.
House : Or somebody else wants to make me happy.
Kutner : Merry Christmas.
UNK: On the one hand, you should be in bed.

Melanie : Can strep cause this?
House : Clap on.
Melanie : Trust me, first place I went.
Melanie : No rash on my labia. Do you need to take a look?
House : I'm saving my money for a Red Rider BB gun.
House : Darker shade of lipstick?
UNK: I'm not wearing any.
House : You tell your mother what you do?
UNK: It doesn't matter. I'm curious.
Melanie : I don't need to break her heart just so I can feel righteous.
UNK: Do you do a donkey show?
House : I'm not curious. It matters.
Melanie : It's a donkey or a mule.
Melanie : I can never remember.
House : Wow. That is a creepy smile.
House : I bet the donkey's is even creepier.
UNK: Do I have to explain... Nope.
UNK: That's my job.
House : Contagious ecthyma.
House : Any contact can cause rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat.
House : Has there been
UNK: contact?
House : Okay. Antibiotic cream for you
House : and a love glove for Francis.
