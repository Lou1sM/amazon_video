UNK: Would have to be in the brain stem.
Foreman : It still doesn't explain the lungs.
House : Weird, though.
House : That he's the boss.
House : Didn't he quit recently? Was it a money issue?
Foreman : Lungs, stomach, numbness...
House : No, that wasn't it.
House : It was something else.
House : Was it bling account? Med plan didn't cover tattoo removal?
Foreman : We have to unify these symptoms.
House : I remember.
UNK: You didn't want to turn into me. Right?
House : You didn't want to become evil.
Foreman : Can we stick to the medicine, here?
UNK: Absolutely.
House : I'm just flattered.
House : In a few short weeks, seems like I've just turned towards the light.
UNK: Either that, or you sold your soul.
Foreman : Multiple marantic emboli could...
UNK: Did you get a raise?
UNK: Because then you're a whore.
UNK: Or didn't you? Because then, you're a stupid whore.
House : Patient just crashed.
House : Can they go, boss?
UNK: You're right. But?
Foreman : No but. You're right about all of it.
House : Then, I'll see you at the reunion.
Foreman : Seems I didn't get out of here soon enough.
Foreman : The world thinks I've been corrupted, so no one will hire me.
Foreman : I hate being here. I'd love to quit, but I can't.
UNK: 13 : He's got a pulse.
Kutner : Must be another respiratory collapse.
Kutner : Means this is our chance to prove laryngospasm.
Amber : We need to tube him and bag him. We will. Right after we...
Amber : If we just let him die, it doesn't matter what he has.
Kutner : Brennan, tilt his head back so I can get a straight shot.
Amber : Okay. While you're killing him, I'll get the intubation kit.
House : I decided you're right. You're obviously in an impossible position.
House : There's no point in me humiliating you.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: So, I'm gonna humiliate Cuddy.
House : Until she fires you.
Foreman : Guy's faking. It's Munchausen's.
Foreman : You notice the EMT run sheet?
Foreman : Paramedic who brought him in is also named Martin Harris.
House : If the name was Attila Von Weinerschnitzel,
UNK: I'd say you might be onto something.
UNK: Look, room 406, abdominal pain,
Foreman : room 403, left-sided numbness, 402, syncope.
UNK: He's copying his neighbors' symptoms.
UNK: No. Yeah.
Foreman : Coincidence is much more likely than you being a stubborn jerk.
House : Munchausen's patients create symptoms, not names.
House : Munchausen's patients have medical histories
Foreman : they don't want us reading.
Taub : No laryngeal spasm.
UNK: 13 : Breathing's resumed normal rate, without intubation.
UNK: You see? Nothing's wrong with him.
House : He's in a lab coat.
House : Munchausens pretend to be patients, not doctors.
House : He's got Mirror Syndrome.
UNK: Giovannini's?
House : Do you know another Mirror Syndrome?
House : Brain's got no idea who he is, where he is, what he is,
UNK: so it fills the holes with whatever dirt's lying around.
House : He reads a name tag, he's got a name.
House : Sees a doctor, he's got a job. Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.
Foreman : My explanation's simpler.
House : Well, if it's simple, then we discharge the nutbar,
House : but if it's complicated, then the nutbar has got brain damage.
Foreman : So, we let him jerk them around for a few days till we're sure?
House : No. We let him jerk you around.
House : There's a faster way.
