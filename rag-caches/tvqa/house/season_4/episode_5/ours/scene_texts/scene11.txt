House : What type of work?
Patient : I'm tired.
UNK: I eat out a lot. A lot of restaurants.
UNK: The Knotty Pine,
UNK: Ritchies.
Patient : I know those places.
House : They're good, huh?
Patient : They're convenient.
House : For what?
Patient : They're on the road.
House : You on the road a lot?
Patient : No more than you, I suppose.
House : You ever use this stuff?
House : I use it all the time.
House : I use it all the time.
House : Yeah. I just said that.
House : You know, the cool thing about this stuff is you can do a lot with it.
UNK: Soften your skin, you can treat scrapes,
House : naughty stuff.
House : Why did you do that?
Patient : Because it doesn't smell like dung.
House : You're saying you like the smell?
Foreman : Not really.
UNK: It just doesn't smell like dung.
House : Something else does smell like dung?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Dung.
House : You guys ready?
UNK: Now is the time that you stare at me in slack-jawed amazement.
House : He sells farm equipment.
House : See? Pig lagoons. Pig farms.
House : And as every child knows, where you have pigs, you have pig poo.
House : But as very few children know,
House : where you have pig poo, you have eperythrozoon infection.
UNK: 13 : We'll start him on clarithromycin.
House : This time tomorrow he'll be back to his old self.
House : Whoever that might be.
Foreman : It can wait.
Kutner : He has a temperature of 107.
Foreman : It can wait 15 minutes.
Foreman : You know where Cuddy is?
Cuddy : Hi. I'm the Dean of Medicine.
House : Hi. I'm the guy who saved your life.
Wilson : So, what if it's House?
Foreman : Then I take the job at Mount Zion.
Wilson : There is no job at Mount Zion.
Foreman : House said that...
Wilson : Well, if House said it, it must be true.
Cuddy : I can fire him. I can fire him now. I can fire him tomorrow.
Cuddy : I don't even need a reason. She doesn't fire me.
House : She never will fire me. Because she needs...
Cuddy : He's a good doctor, that's all.
Cuddy : I respect his expertise, and I...
House : She's hot for me. Always...
Patient : Shut up!
Cuddy : Well, that could have been either of us.
Patient : You have great yabos.
Cuddy : That still could have been either of us.
House : You lose.
UNK: Seriously. I have always thought my breasts were one of my best features.
UNK: Damn.
House : You all suck.
UNK: The two of you took 14 hours to find a car.
UNK: You forgot to mention that a guy with no memory had memories.
UNK: If you keep on thinking that insane guys have hidden wisdom,
UNK: you're gonna wind up shooting people on a subway.
UNK: Something. So,
Taub : which one of us sucks the most?
UNK: It's a tie. Between?
House : All of you.
Amber : We're all fired?
House : None of you are fired.
Foreman : That was nice of you.
UNK: Sure.
Foreman : Why didn't you fire anyone?
UNK: They're good doctors. Right.
Foreman : Why didn't you let Brennan quit?
Cuddy : He's a good doctor.
UNK: Right.
Foreman : By not letting anyone go,
Foreman : you made six people happy and one person happy and rich.
Foreman : Chase won every one of those bets. So either you're just really nice or...
Foreman : What's your cut?
UNK: Fifty percent.
UNK: How bad do you want to keep your job?
Foreman : I'll keep my mouth shut.
UNK: Hey.
House : You actually do want to stay, don't you?
Foreman : I think I do.
House : Every one of those idiots got some insight about themselves
House : from the pig salesman,
UNK: but not one of them did anything about it.
House : People don't learn. They don't change. But you did.
House : You're a freak.
