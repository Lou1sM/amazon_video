House : Mind if we play through?

House : What's going on here, Martin?
UNK: Operation? House?
Wilson : Who is this guy?
House : Excellent question.
House : Who are you, Martin?
UNK: He just likes to watch and do stuff.
UNK: Number 10 scalpel for initial incision.
Wilson : Glad you're here, House.
House : Of course you are.
House : It's lecture time.
Wilson : Yeah. It is.
Wilson : Stop worrying about the power play.
House : Was that it? I think you can go a lot deeper, here.
House : I mean, why am I so obsessed by all of this?

House : I'll have him sort my mail.
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Deflect.
Wilson : Who is this guy?
House : I think we just found out.
Patient : It's all about Cuddy.
UNK: You've got to be the alpha dog.
UNK: You can almost smell the pheromones now, huh?
Wilson : I like him.
UNK: Told you I didn't need you. House!
Wilson : House, what is going on?
UNK: Ow!
House : Your blood's turned to sludge.
House : If we don't heat you up, you're gonna die.
House : Can't fake that!
House : Mirror Syndrome patients have no agenda, no ax to grind.
House : They can read you because they have to.
House : Moods, attitudes, everything. They're like mind readers.
House : Except they can read your mind.
Foreman : Where are we going?
House : Unfortunately, we have to cure him.
House : His hand wasn't black when he came in.
House : The operating room was sterile.
House : Only thing different was the temperature. Cold agglutinins means...
UNK: It's gotta be some kind of infection.
