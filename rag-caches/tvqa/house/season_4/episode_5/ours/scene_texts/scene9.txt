House : No need for the heart biopsy.
House : I now know exactly who he is and what he has.
UNK: You saved his life. Really?
House : No, you idiot. It's VapoRub and lunch receipts.
UNK: We have his name. We could find his doctor, get his medical records...
UNK: It's 8 : 00 at night. The biopsy will be faster.
UNK: Not fast enough to save him, but that's hardly the point.
UNK: Thirteen.
UNK: Is your name Thirteen?
UNK: Why did you volunteer to go streetwalking?
UNK: 13 : I thought I could help that way.
House : A black Mormon could help that way.
House : There's no reason for you to want to be there.
House : Which means there's a reason you didn't want to be here.
House : Didn't want to look in the mirror?
House : Hi. Cuddy called. She needs you to iron her shirts.
House : We'll take over.
House : Go ahead.
Cameron : Talk to him.
UNK: 13 : You might feel a little tug when the catheter's in the heart.
House : Come on. Make him feel comfortable.
UNK: 13 : I've done this procedure dozens of times. It's completely...
House : My God.
Patient : You are incredibly hot.
House : I'm not here. Deal with her.
Patient : Are you an idiot?
Patient : Do you not think she's hot?
House : I'm not the alpha here. She is. She's my boss.
UNK: 13 : The rash is back.
House : Increase the drip.
House : If you think that's the right thing to do.
Patient : This is so frustrating.
UNK: 13 : I don't think that's me.
UNK: Hey.
House : Get in there. See how he's doing.
Kutner : You were just in there.
House : Apparently, it's impossible to see anything else when I'm in there.
House : I'm a blinding white hot light of power.
UNK: 13 : Got it. Pink. Good size.
UNK: 13 : Nice specimen.
Patient : I'm scared.
UNK: It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
UNK: No.
Patient : No, it's not.
House : I'm not interested in how he's doing.
House : I'm interested in how she's doing.
House : So, get in there and tell me how he's doing.
Kutner : You think he'll mimic her if I'm in there with her?
House : You're a powerful, dominating man, but who knows?
UNK: So, I'm gonna get fired before her? Yes.
UNK: You're gonna get fired right now unless you get in there...
UNK: 13 : Nothing on the biopsy.
House : And how is he?
UNK: 13 : His fever's at 106...
House : I know.
House : But how is he?
House : Bitter? Sexually frustrated?
UNK: 13 : He's delightful.
UNK: 13 : Loves the smell of freshly baked rhubarb pie and isn't afraid to love.
UNK: 13 : Also, his rash is coming back.
Kutner : He needs the meds and the tub. Just to keep him stable.
House : Fine. Soak him again.
Kutner : He'll be happy. Loves hot tubs.
House : No. You love hot tubs.
House : Find the rest of the gang. Tell them to meet me at the lecture hall.
UNK: I hate hot tubs.
House : What did you say?
UNK: I hate... He likes.
House : Who else was in there?
Foreman : No one.
House : You didn't think to mention that?
Kutner : The guy likes warm, swirling water. Didn't know that was diagnostic.
Patient : It's not.
UNK: What it is, is that water hit him, and he had a thought.
House : Not about you, but about him.
House : We need to splash him some more.
