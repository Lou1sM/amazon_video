House : I know when my Vicodin isn't Vicodin.
House : Do you know when your birth control pills aren't birth control pills?
Foreman : If we can keep your fever up, we can get you back on dry land.
Foreman : You feeling okay?
Patient : Surprisingly, yeah.
Patient : I feel pretty good.
Foreman : That's not the way fevers usually work.
Patient : Nothing around here works the way it's supposed to work.
Foreman : No kidding.
Patient : You're giving me a fever.
Patient : Doctors don't give people fevers.
Foreman : It was necessary to keep your blood flowing.
UNK: Yeah.
Foreman : It was necessary.
Patient : And that was all that mattered.
Patient : It's exciting, isn't it?
Foreman : You're happy?
Patient : Why wouldn't I be?
UNK: Whoa. Hey. Hey. You with me?
Foreman : I need help in here!
Foreman : V-fib. We've got to shock him. Get him out of the water.
Kutner : How long's he been out?
Foreman : Just a few seconds.
UNK: He's dry enough. Not yet.
UNK: Dry faster. Ten more seconds.
UNK: He'll get brain damage. He needs...
UNK: Kutner, you... Wait!
Kutner : He's dry enough. Clear.
Taub : It worked.
Foreman : For one of them.
Taub : Cardiac arrest. We were able to shock him back to normal sinus rhythm.
Taub : And Kutner nearly into a coma.
House : So, now, you've electrocuted yourself and set a patient on fire.
UNK: I like the dedication. Thank you.
UNK: It wasn't a compliment. Yeah, it was.
House : The insult comes now. You're insane!
House : You either have an aversion to towels, or you want pain. I think both.
House : I'm thinking it goes back to high school gym.
Foreman : Anybody think we should discuss which infection is causing the cold agglutinins
Foreman : before they stop his heart again?
House : Sure. Why not?
Taub : Until they find his car we have to assume he's traveled
Taub : to Ohio, California, Central America and possibly Weehawken.
Amber : Nothing on the blood cultures. Do them again.
House : Quadruple run time.
Foreman : We know the infection is in his heart. We do a biopsy.
UNK: If we see polys, we've got bacterial. Lymphs, we've got viral.
Brennan : He just had a heart attack. Ripping out a piece might kill him.
UNK: Yeah.
Foreman : We biopsy his toe instead.
House : No. That's a terrible idea.
House : Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his heart. Come on. I'll join you.
House : I got you a job.
House : Mount Zion Hospital in Boston.
Foreman : They have a great diagnostics department.
House : Gilchrist said he'd take you, anyway.
Foreman : That was very nice of you.
House : Oh, God. Does everything have to be about you?
House : It's simple math.
UNK: I'm not gonna back down, you're not gonna back down,
UNK: Cuddy's not gonna back down, and no one's gonna be happy here.
UNK: And Cuddy's gonna end up pregnant.
UNK: What?
Amber : It doesn't matter.
Foreman : Are you saying...
UNK: What is you having sex with... Starts Monday.
House : I could help you pack.
Foreman : I don't want the job.
House : Why not? You're miserable.
Foreman : Apparently not.
House : Well, you're gonna be.
House : Are you smiling?
UNK: No.
House : Do your own stupid biopsy.
UNK: 13 : His name's Robert Elliot. He's from Hamilton, Ohio.
Cole : Here's everything he had in his trunk and his glove box.
