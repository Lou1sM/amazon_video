UNK: Hey, where's your mother in common law?
UNK: Ben Prosner : Dr. House, this is Doug McMurtry.
UNK: Ben Prosner : His girlfriend was working with Megan when...
UNK: Greg House : She's dead?
UNK: Doub Mcmurtry : She passed this morning.
UNK: Greg House : Well, then why are you still here?
UNK: Greg House : I need the old lady's consent to do some treatment.
UNK: Ben Prosner : What'd you find out?
UNK: Greg House : I wish I could tell you, but since you're not legally related...
UNK: What the hell did you find out?
UNK: Greg House : Your girlfriend had an abortion.
UNK: Greg House : See why I didn't tell you?
UNK: Greg House : I'd be insane to also tell you that she's on the pill.
UNK: Ben Prosner : No, she's not.
UNK: Greg House : If they'd known she was on it,
UNK: Greg House : they wouldn't have given her a blood thinner after her hip surgery.
UNK: Greg House : The combination caused the bleeding.
UNK: Greg House : It's good news. It's treatable.
UNK: Greg House : Just give her Tamoxifen, which is normally a breast cancer...
UNK: That's not true.
UNK: Ben Prosner : We wanna have kids.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: See, I already did the blood tests.
UNK: And either she lied to you, or her blood lied to us.
UNK: Ben Prosner : Tell Megan I'm glad she's gonna be okay.
UNK: How're you doing?
UNK: Sam Lee : I got cancer.
UNK: Greg House : You're on an oncology ward. Everybody's got cancer.
UNK: You want sympathy, you ought to try
UNK: the hardly-anything- wrong-with-me ward.
UNK: Greg House : In fact, why don't I take you there right now?
UNK: Greg House : How sick are you? Can you walk?
UNK: Sam Lee : Are you a doctor?
UNK: Greg House : Admitted today. First day of a five-day chemo course.
UNK: Yeah, you can walk. Come on, let's go.
UNK: Sam Lee : Does Dr. Wilson know you're here?
UNK: Greg House : Well, if he didn't, this would be really stupid.
UNK: Greg House : 'Cause then he wouldn't know where his patient was.
UNK: He might think he'd been kidnapped.
UNK: Greg House : Now the room upstairs is bigger, it's got cable,
UNK: better-looking sponge bath nurses.
UNK: Greg House : If you feel sick, you call me directly, not Dr. Wilson.
UNK: Greg House : He's getting his last set of hormone shots.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You put her on Tamoxifen? An anticancer drug?
UNK: Greg House : It blocks estrogen receptors.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Does it also block breathing, and kidney function?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : She's crashing.
UNK: Greg House : Doesn't mean I was wrong.
UNK: This is Dr. Marvin. We're bringing this patient over now. Thanks.
UNK: Greg House : Anybody here a doctor?
UNK: Greg House : Kidney failure, spiking fever, breathing difficulties.
UNK: Greg House : Any theories?
UNK: Greg House : Am I in an M. Night Shyamalan movie?
UNK: Young Doctor : You're House, right?
UNK: Greg House : Okay, I assume you know me
UNK: Greg House : because I once insulted you, your patient, or your relatives.
UNK: Greg House : If that's so, I apologize. I was drunk that day.
UNK: Greg House : Patient initially presented with crush injuries.
UNK: Young Doctor : I know you because Dr. Cuddy issued a memo.
UNK: Greg House : Telling you to cooperate fully with me?
UNK: No.
UNK: Greg House : Figured that was a long shot.
UNK: Greg House : Anybody here not get that memo?
UNK: Young Doctor : Fungal infection.
UNK: Greg House : Don't you have a patient?
