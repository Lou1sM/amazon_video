UNK: Um... Keep going, you're doing great.
UNK: Greg House : You win.
UNK: I don't believe you. I'm not gonna play this game.
UNK: Greg House : Just give me the damn rÃ©sumÃ©s.
UNK: Greg House : And my guitar.
UNK: James Wilson : I don't have it.
UNK: James Wilson : Although I did hear some plangent strumming from under that couch earlier.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: James Wilson : This kidnapper isn't just bold. He's diabolical.
UNK: James Wilson : I guess he realized he probably shouldn't give it back to you
UNK: James Wilson : until after you've had the interviews.
UNK: Huh!
UNK: Greg House : You didn't write anything.
UNK: Greg House : So, what you're saying is, you didn't find that one big explanation
UNK: Greg House : 'cause there isn't one. Clever.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Well, let's just say your anti-depressant theory does explain the fever.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : What about the heart? And don't say a building fell on her.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: A structure collapsed... Shut up.
UNK: Greg House : Come on, it fits. Crushed musculature releases potassium, causes V-tach.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You'd think she'd get crush syndrome after she was crushed,
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : not two days later.
UNK: Greg House : Microvascular occlusions, takes that long for the blood to reperfuse.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : She'd have a baggy heart. Echo it to confirm.
UNK: Ben Prosner : Is crush syndrome good or bad?
UNK: Greg House : Does it sound good?
UNK: Ben Prosner : I mean, compared to the other things it could be.
UNK: Greg House : There are no other things it could be.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Then why are you testing her?
UNK: Greg House : Excellent question.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : What? What is it?
UNK: Greg House : The heart's fine.
UNK: Ben Prosner : Why is she sweating?
UNK: Ben Prosner : Her fever's back.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Why would her fever be back?
UNK: Greg House : I can't say.
UNK: Ben Prosner : You don't know?
UNK: Well, I know. I just can't say, 'cause you'll hit me.
UNK: Greg House : Let's discuss this in front of witnesses.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : The DT's?
UNK: Ben Prosner : So, she's an alcoholic now?
UNK: Greg House : Her first fever was from the medication for her depression.
UNK: Ben Prosner : Or you're wrong.
UNK: Greg House : The second fever was from the self-medication for depression.
UNK: Ben Prosner : This is insane.
UNK: Ben Prosner : You don't think I would have noticed her being constantly drunk?
UNK: Greg House : You were practically living with Sylvia Plath. You didn't notice that.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Tone it down or I will hit you.
UNK: Greg House : Fine. I'll do liver enzyme tests.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Liver enzymes can also be elevated from musculoskeletal trauma.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : They'd be there whether she had a drinking problem or not.
UNK: Greg House : They don't know that. Just pretend to confirm.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : What's the treatment?
UNK: Ben Prosner : She's not an alcoholic.
UNK: Greg House : Hair of the dog. IV alcohol.
UNK: Greg House : Taper it off after a few days.
UNK: Ben Prosner : She's sick and traumatized and half dead,
UNK: Ben Prosner : you wanna make her drunk?
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Just do it.
UNK: Ben Prosner : You can't do this. We lived together. We were gonna have kids.
UNK: You barely even know her.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Apparently, neither did you.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Hi, can I speak to Trevor Kaufman?
UNK: Yo, yo. This is Trev. What up?
UNK: Greg House : This is Dr. Gregory House. Can you come in tomorrow to interview?
UNK: Trevor Kaufman : House? Are you serious? Awesome!
UNK: Hey, I got the House interview!
UNK: Oh, look at me, I got the House interview!
UNK: Shut up! Would you shut up? MAN 2 : I'm so cool.
UNK: Hey, give me the phone back.
UNK: Give the phone back, seriously, man.
UNK: James Wilson : I got a page.
UNK: Male Nurse : No, you didn't.
UNK: James Wilson : They called a code.
UNK: Male Nurse : No, they didn't.
UNK: Male Nurse : You got a page, but not from us.
