UNK: Fever's down. Sweating is abated. Heart's working fine.
UNK: I guess House was right, again.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : That's good news, right?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : It is good news.
UNK: Ben Prosner : So, what does this mean, she's an alcoholic?
UNK: Ben Prosner : There's no other explanation?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : No, sorry.
UNK: Ben Prosner : It doesn't make any sense.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Dr. Cuddy, she's doing this thing with her mouth again.
UNK: Ben Prosner : It's been on and off for the last couple of hours.
UNK: Ben Prosner : Is she trying to talk?
UNK: No.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I think she's screaming.
UNK: Morning.
UNK: Huh!
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Where did you come from?
UNK: Greg House : Apes, if you believe the Democrats.
UNK: Greg House : I heard you were there when I was proven right.
UNK: Greg House : The alcohol treatment took away the heart and fever problems.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Yes, I was also there when you were proven wrong.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : She'd been silently screaming for two hours.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Amylase and lipase are through the roof. She has pancreatitis.
UNK: IV alcohol could cause pancreatitis.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Greg House : You're not gonna argue with me?
UNK: No.
UNK: Greg House : You think I'm right?
UNK: No.
UNK: Why not? No.
UNK: That's not really a yes or no question.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Which is why I'm not answering it.
UNK: Greg House : If it's not the IV alcohol, it's gotta be...
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Not interested.
UNK: Greg House : If I'm wrong,
UNK: Greg House : she's gonna die.
UNK: Greg House : Are you sure you're still Dean of Medicine?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I'm not interested in arguing because I'm not interested in enabling you.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You need someone to bounce ideas off of. You need a team.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Don't follow me.
UNK: Greg House : MAO inhibitor caused the fever,
UNK: Greg House : alcohol caused the pancreatitis,
UNK: Greg House : alcohol withdrawal caused the V-tach.
UNK: Greg House : Your logic is irrefutable.
UNK: Ben Prosner : You're wrong.
UNK: Greg House : Well, who are you gonna believe? A classic toy,
UNK: Greg House : or a woman who, if she had any confidence in her ideas,
UNK: Greg House : wouldn't feel the need to distract you with a water bra?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Are you really just gonna treat the pancreatitis?
UNK: Greg House : Are you here to enable me?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I don't want her to die because you're stubborn.
UNK: Greg House : Wow. So, you can enable and rationalize at the same time.
UNK: Greg House : Guess you are still Dean of Medicine.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : If you're right, then this guy,
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : who's not an ass, who's not a workaholic, who's not a sociopath,
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : has somehow missed both her depression and severe alcoholism.
UNK: Greg House : Yes. Imagine that, a couple with secrets!
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Why would she lie?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Okay, alcoholism, you don't wanna advertise, but...
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : If you're right, there'd be an abnormality on the pancreas.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : At least do an MRI to confirm.
UNK: James Wilson : Oh, my God!
UNK: James Wilson : This guy means business.
UNK: Or guys, could be multiple guys.
