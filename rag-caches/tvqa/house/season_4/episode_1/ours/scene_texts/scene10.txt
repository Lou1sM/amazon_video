UNK: Greg House : Bad things would happen.
UNK: He's in Room 318.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : What are you giving Megan?
UNK: Greg House : Megan? Nothing.
UNK: Nothing? What's going on? What's wrong with her?
UNK: Ben Prosner : Her? Nothing.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Then why are you giving her drugs?
UNK: Greg House : Just some amphetamines to wake her up.
UNK: Greg House : Everything could be explained by her lying to you.
UNK: Greg House : The anti-depressants, the drinking, the pill,
UNK: Greg House : until now.
UNK: Greg House : Now she's allergic to something the chart says she's not allergic to.
UNK: Greg House : That's not her lying, that's the chart lying, which doesn't make sense.
UNK: You know Liz Masters?
UNK: No. Yeah, she worked with Megan.
UNK: Ben Prosner : That was her boyfriend you met outside the morgue.
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Greg House : This is her chart.
UNK: Greg House : She's on MAO inhibitors for depression. She's on the pill.
UNK: Greg House : She had an abortion a month ago,
UNK: Greg House : and she's allergic to cephalosporin.
UNK: Ben Prosner : What's going on here? What, are you saying this isn't Megan?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Ben?
UNK: Ben Prosner : Since when?
UNK: Megan Bradberry : Since right before I began pretending I loved it.
UNK: She's the same size as Megan, the same build, the same hair color.
UNK: Greg House : They were both horribly injured, unrecognizably.
UNK: EMT teams do not second-guess
UNK: Greg House : family members' identifications at accident scenes.
UNK: Ben Prosner : No. Liz died yesterday. This isn't Liz.
UNK: Ben Prosner : I know Megan.
UNK: Ben Prosner : I know her hair, I know her hands, I know her smell.
UNK: Greg House : What's your name?
UNK: Liz.
UNK: Megan Bradberry : Oh, God!
UNK: Greg House : Your girlfriend never lied to you.
UNK: Megan Bradberry : Oh, God.
UNK: Greg House : I did it all by myself, Mommy.
UNK: Leon The Janitor : You talking to me?
UNK: Greg House : Go away.
UNK: Greg House : I did it all by myself, Mommy.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : How'd you know it was me?
UNK: Greg House : There's a scent given off by wounded feral cats.
UNK: Ben Prosner : You were wrong.
UNK: Greg House : I got everything right, just treated the wrong...
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : They had a good relationship.
UNK: Greg House : He couldn't even identify her.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : And you were wrong about needing a team. She almost died.
UNK: Greg House : So, I almost need a team.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You were content with your "people are idiots" theory.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : But Cameron would never have accepted
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : that this guy knew nothing about the love of his life.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : And as soon as you claimed it was multiple conditions,
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Foreman would have done anything to prove you wrong,
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : and then Chase would have done anything to prove you right.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Any one of them would have solved this days ago.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Hire a team.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I don't care how you do it.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Just do it.
UNK: Greg House : Sometimes I am wrong.
UNK: Greg House : I have a gift for observation.
UNK: For reading people and situations, but sometimes I am wrong.
UNK: Greg House : This will be the longest job interview of your life.
UNK: Greg House : I will test you in ways
UNK: Greg House : that you will often consider unfair, demeaning and illegal.
UNK: Greg House : And you'll often be right.
UNK: Greg House : Look to your left.
UNK: Greg House : Now look to your right.
UNK: Greg House : By the end of six weeks,
UNK: Greg House : one of you will be gone,
UNK: as will 28 more of you.
UNK: Greg House : Wear a cup.
