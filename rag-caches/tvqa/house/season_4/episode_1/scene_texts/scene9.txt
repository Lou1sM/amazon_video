UNK: Young Doctor : She shot herself in the leg while high on meth.
UNK: Young Doctor : Wouldn't hurt her to be in pain for a little while.
UNK: Greg House : Fungal infection would be in her eyes by now.
UNK: Haemophilus?
UNK: Greg House : Doesn't explain the remitting fever.
UNK: Greg House : You've heard that I've got a job opening, right?
UNK: Young Doctor : I just care about people.
UNK: Young Doctor : Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
UNK: Greg House : ARDS doesn't explain anything, except the breathing.
UNK: Greg House : If you care about people, you're not getting the job.
UNK: Young Doctor : I was lying. Crush syndrome.
UNK: Greg House : Doesn't explain the breathing.
UNK: Greg House : What was the problem with ARDS?
UNK: Young Doctor : Only explained the breathing.
UNK: Greg House : The crush syndrome?
UNK: Young Doctor : It didn't explain the breathing.
UNK: Are you a fan of symmetry?
UNK: Sure. Weird.
UNK: Greg House : 'Cause your eyes are lopsided,
UNK: Greg House : and by eyes I mean breasts.
UNK: Greg House : ARDS and crush syndrome, both reactions to severe trauma.
UNK: Greg House : Why can't she have both?
UNK: Because...
UNK: Young Doctor : Because then, there's nothing we could do.
UNK: Greg House : Boy, you remind me of someone.
UNK: Greg House : Send me your rÃ©sumÃ©.
UNK: Greg House : I'll put it on top of the pile that I'm never gonna look at.
UNK: Ben Prosner : I couldn't leave.
UNK: Greg House : You don't seem like the type of person who would give up on giving up.
UNK: Ben Prosner : I love her.
UNK: You loved somebody.
UNK: Greg House : Somebody who didn't drink, wanted to have babies
UNK: Greg House : and wasn't miserable.
UNK: Ben Prosner : I know she lied, but...
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : What are you doing? Why are you saying these things to him?
UNK: Greg House : The woman you love doesn't exist. This woman is dying.
UNK: Greg House : She has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and crush syndrome.
UNK: Greg House : Her body's basically giving up.
UNK: We can keep her on supported dialysis and hope for the best.
UNK: Never mind. She has a lump in her arm.
UNK: Ben Prosner : Does that mean you're wrong?
UNK: Well, that'd be good news for you guys.
UNK: We'll know after a biopsy.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Which patient is that?
UNK: Megan... House's patient.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Didn't you get my memo? Sure.
Imelda : Got both memos.
UNK: Both.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : And the second memo said to ignore the first memo.
UNK: Yeah, seemed odd.
UNK: I did an MRI and...
UNK: Of course you did.
UNK: Ben Prosner : What'd you find?
Imelda : It's kind of freaky.
Imelda : She's got growths all over the place.
UNK: Ben Prosner : She's got tumors?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Not exactly.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : The growths are eosinophilic granulomas.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : They are usually from allergic reactions,
UNK: so I'm putting her on steroids.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Allergy to what? She doesn't have allergies.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : We don't know.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Unfortunately, the only drug she's had enough of
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : to have this kind of reaction is cephalosporin.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : And why is that unfortunate?
UNK: Ben Prosner : 'Cause she was on it two months ago.
UNK: Ben Prosner : That's what you mean, right?
UNK: Ben Prosner : She took it for strep throat so she can't be allergic to it.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : It would seem so.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : What is this hospital doing to her?
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : She has had three separate medical disasters,
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : and now she's dying of an allergy she can't possibly have?
UNK: James Wilson : Mr. Lee. I just have to check...
UNK: James Wilson : Sam? Are you okay?
UNK: James Wilson : What are you doing here?
UNK: Male Nurse : I was taking a nap.
UNK: James Wilson : Where's my patient?
UNK: James Wilson : You stole my patient.
UNK: Greg House : You kidnapped my guitar.
UNK: James Wilson : Give him back.
UNK: Greg House : Only when you give her back.
UNK: It's a she?
UNK: Greg House : It's certainly not a dude.
UNK: James Wilson : It's a guitar. You took a human being!
UNK: Greg House : Now who doesn't have a sense of humor?
UNK: Greg House : I'm monitoring the guy remotely.
UNK: James Wilson : What, are you listening for the distant sound of screaming?
UNK: Greg House : The nurses know to call me.
UNK: James Wilson : They don't know who he is!
UNK: Greg House : His name's right there on the chart. Now go away. I'm working.
UNK: James Wilson : They give him the wrong meds, who the hell knows what's gonna happen?
UNK: House!
