UNK: Greg House : Wilson, you idiot.
UNK: The Guitarnapper : Listen carefully, and no one will get hurt.
UNK: You must follow the instructions.
UNK: James Wilson : Any attempt to contact the FBI or other law enforcement agencies,
UNK: or Cuddy, will be met with the...
UNK: James Wilson : And a large Coke, no ice.
UNK: Give it back. What happened?
UNK: James Wilson : Did someone kidnap your guitar,
UNK: a $12,0001967 Flying V or something?
UNK: Greg House : Where'd you hide it?
UNK: I'm flattered you would consider me this bold and brilliant.
UNK: Greg House : Yeah. It takes a...
UNK: Greg House : It takes a criminal mastermind
UNK: Greg House : to pull off a heist from an unlocked, unguarded room down the hall.
UNK: Greg House : What do you want?
UNK: James Wilson : Me? Nothing.
UNK: James Wilson : But I'm sure the kidnapper wants whatever a kidnapper wants.
UNK: James Wilson : To see you interview five to seven well-qualified fellowship candidates.
UNK: Greg House : I don't need a team.
UNK: James Wilson : You were bouncing ideas off a janitor.
UNK: Greg House : And solved the case!
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : If you can hear what I'm saying, blink once.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You can't talk right now. You have a tube down your throat.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : And try not to move your head. You've been in a terrible accident,
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : but it looks like you will have no permanent injuries.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : You've had a bad fever, but it's gone now.
UNK: Ben Prosner : I've been here the whole time, honey. Okay? I'm not leaving.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : This is very important.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I need you to blink one for yes, twice for no.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Were you seeing a psychiatrist?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Were you on MAO inhibitors, the anti-depressant?
UNK: Ben Prosner : Megan, it's okay. It doesn't matter, okay? I love you.
UNK: Mrs. Bradberry : Honey? Honey, what's wrong?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Megan, are you all right?
UNK: Ben Prosner : What's happening? Are we upsetting her?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Heart is beating too fast. Get the family out of here.
UNK: Megan?
UNK: Megan! Charging to 200.
UNK: Meg. Meg! Megan!
UNK: Clear!
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : We shocked her back into sinus rhythm, but she's still tachycardic.
UNK: Greg House : Fascinating. Equally fascinating is, why are you here?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : I was gonna leave you alone if you won the bet.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : But you lost.
UNK: Greg House : I explained the fever, which is all we were talking about.
UNK: Greg House : She confirmed the anti-depressants.
UNK: Greg House : Go bet with someone else if you wanna explain the heart problems.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : She confirmed them by winking.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Maybe there was a cute guy across the room.
UNK: Greg House : She got better when I treated her. Even I'm not that cute.
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Two unrelated symptoms. Just a coincidence?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : Or you're grasping at straws
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : to avoid admitting you can't do this on your own.
UNK: Fine.
UNK: Greg House : What explains the fever and persistent tachycardia?
UNK: Lisa Cuddy : It could be anything. Endocarditis?
UNK: No. Fever, no infection.
