Wilson : He died almost an hour ago.
Wilson : Apparently, it's bad to electrocute yourself
Wilson : within days of suffering massive internal injuries.
Wilson : Why did you need to talk to him?
Wilson : Did you see something?
Wilson : Eosinophilic pneumonia.
Wilson : House? What did you see?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: Whose idea was that?
UNK: Brennan.
UNK: "Nothing," you don't want to talk about it, or, "Nothing... "
House : Which one's Brennan?
House : Is he the ridiculously old guy?
UNK: House, you've got to talk about this.
House : If it's aggressive enough it might have gotten past the steroids.
House : Start him on cyclophosphamide.
Wilson : I already did.
Wilson : Just looking at you hurts.
UNK: I'm gonna order up some extra pain meds.
House : I love you.
Stark : How fast will this work?
Thirteen : New meds should start helping in minutes, okay? Hang in there.
Jody : Vacutainer's full. I need to replace it.
UNK: I don't think it's working.
Thirteen : Try and relax.
UNK: You must be wrong.
Thirteen : Stop talking.
UNK: Hurry up and get the chest tube working.
Jody : Okay. I got it.
UNK: Can you get Hoover?
Stark : I can't...
Stark : Can you put my
UNK: hand
Stark : on his head?
Stark : It's okay. Don't worry.
Stark : I'm not scared.
House : Oh, God.
Thirteen : Time of death...
Amber : You're looking better.
Amber : Stark's dead.
Amber : What are you doing?
House : Going to see our patient.
Amber : He's dead.
UNK: "Dead" is not a diagnosis.
Amber : You really shouldn't be...
House : Shut up and give me my cane.
Amber : I assume we're all fired.
House : Should I fire myself, too?
House : I thought it was strongyloides, then I thought it was cancer.
UNK: A little help, here?
Amber : Ready? One, two...
UNK: Why did you call me?
House : Because if I pooped myself in front of Wilson,
House : I'd never hear the end of it.
Amber : But why not one of the others?
UNK: You always have that phone in your hand.
Amber : We all have cell phones, that's not the reason. What is?
House : If I died, you'd never get the job.
House : I knew you wouldn't let that happen.
Amber : You don't think anybody else has any reason to care?
UNK: I think this is starting to come back to me.
UNK: It's right, left, then repeat.
House : Yeah. That works.
House : What did we miss?
Jody : If we knew, he wouldn't be dead.
House : So, that's it? You're just gonna give up?
Thirteen : No. We were defeated. It's over.
Jody : Patient presented with syncope.
Jody : We thought it was thread worms, gave him ivermectin.
Stark : Thank you.
UNK: The patient seemed better until his blood turned green.
Thirteen : Can we at least remove the body before
Thirteen : launching into a purely academic exercise?
