Cuddy : Why are you here?
House : My offices are being used by my teams.
UNK: Teams?
House : Which means this is the only place where you can yell at me.
UNK: You have "teams"?
House : Two of them.
House : I wanted to deal with the yelling today
House : because I noticed what you were wearing,
House : and I wouldn't have to listen all that closely.
Cuddy : You can't make a competition out of patient care.
House : Without competition, we'd still be single cell organisms.
UNK: Can I go now? Not until after the yelling.
Cuddy : What's wrong with him?
House : I have seven of the finest minds on it.
House : Along with three very special...
Cuddy : You wouldn't be doing this unless you already knew.
UNK: I tell you, you tell them. Game's over.
Cuddy : If you know, you are obligated to treat...
House : Well, then, in that case, I don't know.
House : Why would a guy voluntarily shove
House : a metal object into an electrical socket?
Cuddy : I'm getting closer and closer to knowing the answer.
Cuddy : What would happen if I shut down this game?
UNK: I'd fire them all, hire 40 new fellowship applicants
UNK: and start the game all over again.
