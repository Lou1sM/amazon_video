UNK: Your card. No.
Kutner : I'm going to prep you for a transesophageal echo.
Finn : You sure you shuffled these?
Kutner : And I'm going to need to sedate you.
UNK: Might wanna check your wallet first.
Finn : Would you check your wallet? It's part of the trick.
UNK: 13 : That's my card. How did you do that?
Kutner : Do it again?
UNK: Thought you weren't playing. I'm not.
Amber : She'll fire you if she catches you.
Taub : I don't think she can fire me for not trying to steal her panties.
Amber : You trying to will them off?
Taub : If I had a plan,
Taub : the first part would be not telling you what the plan was.
Amber : You haven't touched that coffee.
Taub : Yes, I have.
Amber : She can't keep her panties on if they're wet. We work together.
Amber : One wins, protects the other.
Taub : Or, I win by myself, and then you try desperately to convince me to spare you.
Amber : Dr. Cuddy!
Cuddy : Dr. Taub, are you okay?
Taub : I just tripped. I'm so sorry.
Amber : I have some extra time. Do you need any help in the clinic?
UNK: Okay.
Kutner : We found no apparent cause for the arrest. TTE and TEE revealed no...
Foreman : Send the patient home. You can give him a lift.
Kutner : We checked for clots, we checked for...
Foreman : You're reporting to me because you're scared to report to House,
Foreman : because you found nothing, because this isn't a case.
Foreman : And you thought I'd save your ass.
UNK: Yeah.
Kutner : I thought he was sick. What was I supposed to do?
Foreman : What about his lungs? Decreased oxygen saturation leads to heart failure.
Kutner : ER didn't find anything. ER wasn't looking.
Foreman : Too busy trying to keep him alive. Get an MRI.
UNK: Clinic. Yes, can you ask Dr. Cuddy
Amber : to come to the nurses' station? Stat.
Woman : Right away.
UNK: I asked you to get Dr. Cuddy.
Nurse : Dr. Taub said she'd be right out.
Finn : A fungus in my lungs? How would I even get something like that?
UNK: Well, right now it's just a theory. We don't even know if...
UNK: God, I knew I shouldn't have done those mushrooms in college.
Kutner : I'm sure there's no connection.
Finn : It was a joke.
Finn : You really lose your sense of humor when your job's on the line.
Kutner : Sorry. Most dying people don't really like to...
Kutner : Not that you're dying.
Finn : But a little sick would be perfect?
UNK: Yeah.
Finn : My stomach!
Kutner : Stabbing or throbbing?
Kutner : Grey Turner's sign. He's got internal bleeding.
UNK: 13 : I'll call surgery.
