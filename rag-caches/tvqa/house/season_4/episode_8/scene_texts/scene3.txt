House : You are a hack.
Finn : I don't screw up.
House : Nosebleed that major means he's actually sick.
House : Means the cardiac arrest was a symptom.
House : Stop gloating.
Kutner : I'm not gloating.
House : Then what's that smirk?
UNK: No smirk, it's just how I look.
Cole : What about the underwear challenge?
House : I declare it officially on hold.
Cole : Not really fair, but I get it.
Cole : It's Cuddy's.
House : Pull down your pants.
Cole : You think I'm lying?
House : No, I want to give you a reward. Yes, I think you're lying.
UNK: Cardiac arrest plus nosebleed. Go.
UNK: 13 : Patient has no significant family history, no angina, no prior attacks.
UNK: What if isn't his heart?
Amber : What if it's the vessels around his heart?
Amber : Polyarteritis nodosa causes cardiac symptoms and hypertension,
Amber : which makes his nose bleed.
Taub : You know what else makes your nose bleed and your heart race? Cocaine.
Taub : Guy works in a B-list nightclub in Atlantic City.
Taub : He's got to be taking regular rolls in the snow.
UNK: You, take the gloater to the patient's drug den.
House : Make sure you pat down his pockets before you leave.
UNK: You and Big Love, biopsy a blood vessel from around the heart.
House : Test for polyarteritis nodosa.
UNK: You, in my office.
UNK: 13 : Those aren't my panties.
House : I know.
UNK: Hypothetical.
House : A young woman does something clumsy in public,
House : and instead of laughing it off, she gets irrationally upset. Explain.
UNK: Maybe she's clumsy 'cause she's nervous
UNK: 13 : 'cause she forgot to do her spelling homework.
UNK: Well, in my hypothetical, she's eight.
House : This girl's not insecure. Seems more like she's afraid.
UNK: 13 : Do you have a point, or did you just get a new book of riddles?
House : I think you're hiding a medical condition.
UNK: 13 : I'm not.
UNK: 13 : I'm glad we had this talk.
House : Doctors often try to ignore their symptoms, because they think they can't get sick.
House : If you've got something going on, I need you to take care of it.
UNK: 13 : And I take your compassion entirely at face value.
House : It's not compassion. It's self-interest.
House : I want my team healthy.
UNK: It's not self-interest. It's curiosity.
UNK: 13 : I dropped a file, House.
UNK: 13 : I start bleeding from the eyes, I'll be sure to make an appointment.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Well, found some pot.
Kutner : Bag it.
Taub : I'm not sure it really fits the symptoms.
Kutner : Of course not, but it'd be irresponsible to leave it here.
UNK: You have a quarter? No.
Kutner : How did Cole get those panties off Cuddy?
Taub : They were never on her.
Taub : No way those are hers.
UNK: Aha.
UNK: Tularemia.
UNK: No, he'd have to have rabbits.
Taub : True, maybe a tick jumped from a rabbit
Taub : and landed on one of these white, fluffy alligators.
Taub : Then it jumps onto our patient,
Taub : transfers the bacteria, causes pericarditis, explains everything.
