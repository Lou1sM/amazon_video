Foreman : Everybody has to put up with their boss' stupid stunts.
Thirteen : No, they don't. There's HR, there's Cuddy, there's other jobs.
Foreman : House doesn't listen to HR, Cuddy'll let him fire us before she fires him,
Foreman : and I don't want another job.
Thirteen : Why do you cling to him? Why do you defend him?
Foreman : Just because I don't want to be unemployed doesn't mean I'm co-dependent.
Thirteen : I'm not saying you're co-dependent, I'm saying you're scared.
Foreman : You know what? You're right.
Thirteen : So, you wanna quit?
Foreman : No, I wanna stop a stupid stunt.
Foreman : House doesn't want either one of us to quit. He wants this.
