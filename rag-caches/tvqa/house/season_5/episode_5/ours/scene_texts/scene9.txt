House : Did she cry?
House : When you told her that she was going to die, did she cry?
Thirteen : She got upset, she...

House : A chemical irritant which causes people to have a very predictable reaction.
Thirteen : She has no tears.
UNK: but I didn't have time to stop by Wilson's.
UNK: She has SjÃ¶gren's, that attacks the glands that produce tears and saliva.
UNK: It also, by the way, causes lung cysts and RTA.
Thirteen : It doesn't cause bleeding.

Thirteen : I'm so sorry. He must have followed me.
Cuddy : I'm sure.
