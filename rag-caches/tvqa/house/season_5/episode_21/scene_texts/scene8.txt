Wilson : You should be losing it.
Wilson : You'd be crazy not to be off your game.
UNK: But your mojo's right where you left it.
Wilson : Just keep playing with it.
Wilson : I gotta go. Help yourself.
Taub : I know this is a tough process.
Taub : At the first sign of any tumors or masses we can...
Franni : Start saying prayers?
Thirteen : It's gonna be okay. Once we can... No, it is not gonna be okay.
Franni : You're growing his cancer.
Husband : This isn't the doctors' fault.
Doug : I've exposed myself to a lot of bad stuff. I knew the risks.
Doug : I want my life to mean something,
UNK: and if that means I'm destined to...
Thirteen : He's in V-tach, and no pulse. Grab the paddles.
Franni : Oh, God.
Taub : Charging. Clear.
Taub : Charging. Clear.
Chase : I've been looking for you.
Cameron : And I've been thinking about you.
Cameron : Just hadn't reached the looking stage yet.

Chase : You asked for a day, I gave you two.
Chase : You told me you had a secret you couldn't share, I respected that.
Chase : Now I don't know what's worse,
Chase : blowing off our vacation to hang around House,
Chase : or continuing to blow it off when he won't hang around you.
Cameron : If you think I'm the least bit interested in House...
Chase : I don't know what I'm supposed to think.
Cameron : I know this looks bad and...
Chase : I don't care how it looks, I care what it is.
Chase : And you're not telling me what it is.
House : I'm trying to trust you, but...
Doug : I just...
Cameron : I need a little more time.
UNK: No.
Cameron : This has nothing to do with House.
Chase : Yeah, well, it has nothing to do with me either, not anymore.
Chase : Let me know when I can come pick up my things.
Taub : Nothing on the echo. We drew a troponin level,
Thirteen : no signs of myocardial ischemia.
Taub : All the tests were normal.
Foreman : Loss of balance, pathological hiccups, air leak between the lungs,
Taub : broken femur, now tachycardia. Go.
