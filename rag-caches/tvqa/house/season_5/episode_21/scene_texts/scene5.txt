Wilson : I know you're here to advance some paranoid theory
Wilson : based on a single egg-white omelet, and I'd like to get it over with
Wilson : so we can both go to sleep.
UNK: Your single-omelet theory
House : conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll you had for lunch today,
UNK: a vegetable and grain gag-a-thon.
Wilson : The Warren Commission found no evidence of a second lunch,
Wilson : possibly because it was stolen from the doctors' lounge.
House : You're not getting any fatter,
House : your medical records were clean.
Wilson : You checked my...
House : You're alone tonight, so it's Kutner.
Wilson : How could Kutner have any conceivable...
House : Your patients live, your patients die,
House : you float above it all like a medical colossus.
House : But a fellow doctor dies...
Wilson : That's brilliant.
Wilson : Kutner was a wake-up call that if I didn't eat healthier,
Wilson : I might kill myself.
House : Mortality is mortality.
Wilson : And ice cream is ice cream.
UNK: Full-fat content. Quadruple-fat content.
House : Stuff you haven't eaten just proves you haven't eaten it.
House : You were hoping for evidence of stuff I have eaten?
Wilson : First door on the right.
Foreman : Excruciating pain in his left leg.
Foreman : Acute onset, about 10 minutes ago.
UNK: Foreman continues : What are you doing to him?
House : I assume they were checking for vascular pulsation.
House : Either it's negative or he's a big wuss.
Thirteen : It's not a tumor or an aneurysm.
House : Metabolic bone disease?
Foreman : Bone density's normal.
Taub : But the bone covering might not be.
Taub : If it's osteomyelitis, an infection eating away at his periosteum...
House : Explains the pain. Odds are it's a subclinical infection
House : that we made worse with the steroids we gave him.
House : Start him on IV antibiotics, x-ray his legs to confirm osteomyelitis.
Thirteen : Cameron's already done a full set of lower body x-rays.
House : Infection obviously flared, do them again.
Wilson : Even if I had changed my diet,
Wilson : what possible reason could I have for hiding it from you?
Thirteen : Ankle, tibia, fibula, all look normal.
Thirteen : No inflammation, no signs of osteo.
Thirteen : You and your wife, you talk about stuff?
UNK: Sex.
Thirteen : No. Anything else.
UNK: Money.
Taub : I'm gonna go way out on a limb here.
Taub : Foreman not a Chatty Cathy?
Thirteen : Normally, it doesn't matter. Last week, it did.
UNK: You want to date men, good chance talking won't be...
Taub : His femur's fractured.
Thirteen : That's impossible. It's the hardest bone in the body.
Taub : And he broke it lying in bed.
Taub : How can you have a broken femur without so much as a bruise?
Foreman : Whatever broke it had to do it from within.
Thirteen : Osteogenesis imperfecta?
