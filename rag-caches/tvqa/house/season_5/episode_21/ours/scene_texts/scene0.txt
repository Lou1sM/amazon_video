Cameron : I need to push back our getaway.
Chase : No, you don't. I found you a board, perfect size to learn on.
Cameron : I'm just postponing. O'Neil, from Philly General,
Cameron : wants me to get a patient in to see House.
UNK: So?
UNK: I owe him a favor.
UNK: He's taken about a dozen of my referrals over the last year.
Chase : I meant, so, that's five seconds to hand House the file,
Chase : 30 for him to question your real motives,
Chase : a minute for witty comments
Chase : comparing the length of your legs to Thirteen's...
Chase : Plenty of time left over for the shore.
Cameron : I need to make sure he doesn't toss the file in the trash
Cameron : as soon as I'm out of sight.
Chase : Babe, can't you repay the favor on another case?
Chase : After last week, I could really use a break from this place.
