UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Hold that.
UNK: You want your answer, you gotta give me the gun.
House : What's this?
Thirteen : Starburst artifact, the metal from the gun is ruining the image.
House : Show him.
UNK: Starburst.
House : Now, unless you think we pre-arranged that
House : just in case we were ever held hostage by a guy who needs a CT, we're not lying.
House : So, you have two choices,
House : you can give me the gun and get your answer,
House : or you can shoot me.
Bowman : I'm not gonna give you the gun.
Cuddy : Why did he release you?
Regina : House got him to give up his gun. We just ran.
House : Why are you still here? Curious.
Oliver : It's safe now, right?
Jason : They're gonna be through that door any moment, just show me the tumor.
House : There isn't one.
House : I don't know what you have.
UNK: So,
Jason : it's over.
Jason : Thanks for trying.
Jason : You had four theories, you ruled out four theories.
Jason : Maybe no one can cure me.
House : He overpowered me. Got the gun back.
UNK: You're a coward.
Thirteen : You need to know everything because you're afraid to be wrong.
Thirteen : You're so afraid of being ordinary, of being just another doctor,
Thirteen : just another human being, that you'll risk other people's lives.
House : I'm arrogant, you're the coward.
House : You're terrified of death.
House : You just want to cheat it by making it come sooner.
UNK: It gives you the illusion of control.
Oliver : Can I go?
House : Sorry. We might need you.
House : How do they expect me to think?
Bowman : Is he lying? Why would he do that?
Bowman : Over time, hostages start to root for the captor.
Cuddy : House isn't the rooting kind.
Bowman : No, he's the obsessive, defiant kind.
