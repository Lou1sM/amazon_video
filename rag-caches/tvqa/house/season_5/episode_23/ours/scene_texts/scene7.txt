Wilson : I need glucose in here!
Wilson : You could have died.
House : It worked. Where are my pants?
Wilson : Are you sure?
House : She's been everywhere I've been for days.
House : She's not here. Ergo...
Wilson : This was not the next rational step.
House : Now who's being biased?
House : You wanted me to detox as much as I wanted...
UNK: I forgot how to do my zipper.
Wilson : Any other neurological deficits?
House : You don't seem to annoy me as much as usual. Not sure that's a deficit.
House : And I'm all better.
Wilson : Is she really gone? Absolutely.
House : I can feel myself repressing all kinds of icky things.
House : I check out, don't I?
UNK: Damn.
Chase : He didn't see anything. He saw an artifact on the monitor.
Foreman : It was a shadow on her heart.
Chase : She'd already been technically dead for three minutes.
Chase : I thought keeping her alive took precedence over prolonging the photo op.
House : Any brain damage?
UNK: No, all tests indicate that...
UNK: Obviously you had more time.
Chase : Best of luck.
House : I assume we can't kill her again, take more pictures.
UNK: You don't want to check with Wilson?
House : Good one.
Taub : It's something, a lesion.
Thirteen : Tumor, scar tissue.
Foreman : Could be an abscess. Infection.
Foreman : Explains why it's invisible in the blood.
Foreman : It's doing its damage behind closed doors. Sealed off.
House : See, the problem with speculation is
UNK: you make a "spec" out of you and some guy named "Lation,"
House : which really doesn't affect me at all.
Taub : We have to guess. It's all we've got.
Taub : We can't do a biopsy. Last time we went into her heart
Taub : she had a major cardiac event.
House : Which just leaves...
Taub : What are you looking for?
House : I don't know yet.
Thirteen : Picture doesn't change. She lies there in pain, he sits there worried.
House : Nothing changes.
House : I just had an epiphany. All by myself.
