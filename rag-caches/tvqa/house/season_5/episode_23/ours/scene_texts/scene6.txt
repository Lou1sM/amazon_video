UNK: Hopefully.
UNK: I had an idea.
Wilson : Stop having ideas.
House : Insulin shock.
Wilson : Yes, that's marginally less dangerous than ECT,
Wilson : puts you in a coma, could cause... It could work.
Wilson : If you had psychosis, which you don't.
UNK: I have no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting,
House : none of the symptoms of Vicodin overdose.
Wilson : Yeah, except the "I see dead people" thing.
House : I've been popping pills for years.
House : I've only been seeing things for days. Something changed.
Wilson : Vicodin addiction is still more likely.
House : So we're no longer dealing in absolutes.
Wilson : then we can talk about how you'd rather be in a coma than in rehab.
House : Actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful.
UNK: Why?
House : Because I'm about to put myself into insulin shock.
Thirteen : Left atrium is fine.
Taub : Left coronary artery also fine.
Taub : We're almost at three minutes. Keep going.
Chase : Chordae tendineae clear. Right atrium is fine.
UNK: I gotta start her back up. We have some time.
Chase : We're over. Right coronary artery is fine.
Thirteen : The three-minute threshold is a guideline.
Chase : She might have less. We have to stop.
Foreman : What's that by the aorta?
Taub : I don't see anything. I'm restarting her heart.
Foreman : That's a shadow! Two centimeters...
House : You're only scared because you know this is going to work.
Thirteen : We're over three minutes.
