House : Don't give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.
Wilson : Who were you talking to?
House : Someone who's not actually here, beyond that seems irrelevant.
Wilson : Your mind made a choice. It means something.
Amber : You know he's just gonna keep asking.
UNK: Kutner.
Amber : Good choice. He feels bad.
House : You gonna help me or not?
UNK: Yeah.
Chase : I could eat from this place seven days a week.
Cameron : We practically do.
Chase : You can order tomorrow night.
Chase : Do you want some wine? No, thanks.
Cameron : I have my husband's sperm.
Chase : Your dead husband's?
Cameron : We froze it when he got diagnosed.
Chase : And you kept it? All this time?
Cameron : I used to think, if I didn't find anyone...
Chase : You found someone.
Cameron : I know.
UNK: But...
Chase : What if it goes wrong?
Chase : What if I turn out to be a radical anarchist
Chase : with a secret family, and that I age backwards?
Cameron : Nobody plans on getting divorced.
Cameron : I didn't plan on my husband dying. But he did.
Chase : So, you're saying you want a pre-nup?
Chase : In liquid form?
Wilson : What if it's not sleep apnea?
Wilson : Trauma from your motorcycle accident?
Wilson : Vicodin abuse? You need to be admitted.
Amber : I know you're wrong about sleep apnea,
Amber : which means you know you're wrong about sleep apnea.
Amber : You're scared. Tell him you're scared.
UNK: I can't sleep with you here.
Wilson : Did it work?
House : Do you see someone standing beside me?
UNK: No.
House : Then no.
Amber : So what's next on your list of things it's not?
Foreman : Patient's not responding to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.
House : So run a test to confirm it's pneumonia.
Foreman : We can't do a bronc because her lungs are still collapsed.
House : Transtracheal aspiration.
Foreman : That's basically waterboarding.
Wilson : It is pretty radical.
Amber : It's a great idea.
House : Regular radical, me radical or me-out-of-my-mind radical?
Wilson : Somewhere between regular and you.
House : So what's the problem?
Foreman : Everything okay?
House : No. Our patient can't breathe.
House : Either do the test or come up with a better one.
House : So we're down to infection, trauma,
House : MS, schizophrenia, or pills.
Wilson : Schizophrenia usually manifests younger.
House : That's why it's further down the list.
UNK: I can confirm an infection with a simple blood test.
