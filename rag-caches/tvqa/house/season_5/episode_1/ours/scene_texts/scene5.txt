UNK: Bye.
House : You have to stop Wilson from committing career malpractice.
Cuddy : Talk to him.
House : Already talked to him twice, he threw me out.
UNK: Mocking him and insulting him, let's see, yes,
Cuddy : technically, those are categories of conversation.
House : Block his references to other hospitals, tell him he can't hand off his cases until...
Cuddy : Talk to him.
Cuddy : Deal with his grief, talk to him about what he's going through.
House : That's a brilliant idea. I'll take him out for a beer,
House : that'll make up for the fact that Amber's in a pine box,
House : that there's randomness and chaos in the universe.
Cuddy : Tell him you're sorry.
House : I didn't kill her.
Cuddy : You were drunk and...
House : Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk, she might never have been born. So...
Cuddy : You called her up in the middle of the night,
UNK: she was on the bus because of you.
House : I didn't ask her to come out, I wasn't driving the bus,
Lou : I wasn't driving the garbage truck that hit the bus,
House : and I did not prescribe her the flu meds that killed her.
Cuddy : Yes, I know, that's all true, but...
Cuddy : You really don't feel any sense of guilt?
