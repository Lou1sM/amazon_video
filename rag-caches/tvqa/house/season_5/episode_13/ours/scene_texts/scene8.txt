Cameron : Already am, thanks. Your baby needs you a lot more than we do.
Cuddy : You aren't hungry, you aren't wet, I don't know what it is.
Sarah : That is so annoying. Can you make it stop?
House : Baby's crying is annoying you? What's her nerve conduction?
Cameron : 14.3. It's actually speeding up.
Cameron : But her BP's 80 over palp. We're gonna have to stop.
House : That doesn't make any sense.
Cameron : The fact that you're wrong doesn't make any sense
Chase : or the fact that I believed that you were right?
Cameron : BP's still dropping. She's gonna stroke.
UNK: I'm giving her 10 more cc, and I'm putting an end to this.
Cuddy : Okay, Rachel, quiet down. I need you to be quiet.
UNK: Please, turn that phone off.
House : Why does the baby annoy you, but no one else does?
House : I mean, you're right about her, but...
Cuddy : I don't know what you want. I will give you anything that you want.
Cuddy : I don't know what it is.
Cuddy : Tell me. Please. Just help me. Please!
UNK: Really?
Cuddy : That worked?
Cameron : She's stable.
Cameron : We're finished here. Close her up.
Sarah : How long until we can perform the splenectomy?
Cameron : Can't dose her with anesthesia until the last batch completely clears.
House : How come the baby annoyed her?
Kutner : We should get her in there as soon as we can.
Cameron : Two hours, at least.
Kutner : Her blood pressure's in the tank. I hope she lasts two hours.
House : What was different?
House : Our patient loves all things annoying.
Cameron : She'd love this conversation.
House : She's an earth mother,
House : takes in the freaks and rejects of humanity and tells them they're A-okay.
House : So, what was different?
Cameron : Her head was open, you were asking her questions, a baby was crying.
House : She had low blood pressure.
Wilson : According to the laws of physics,
House : low blood pressure causes light-headedness
House : chest pain, but not annoyance.
Cuddy : Move your feet.
