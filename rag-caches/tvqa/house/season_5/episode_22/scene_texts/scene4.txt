House : is the same as your commitment the day before,
House : then the wedding meant nothing.
House : So, and I see no logical way around this, if you want your marriage to matter,
House : you have to be a wanton, trolling, muck-covered pig the day before.
UNK: You're evil. See you.
House : The wall of the fourth ventricle changed, it isn't bowed in the older scan.
House : Evidence of NF2, right?
Wilson : You'd need to do a brain biopsy to confirm.
Wilson : I'm not going to the bachelor party. Every time I go to one of your parties,
Wilson : I end up embarrassing myself in some new and unexpected way.
House : That whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.
Wilson : I'm not going.
UNK: Okay.
Amber : It's not okay.
Amber : Do you know who we need?
Amber : That stripper you got for Wilson's bachelor party.
Amber : You could do body shots right off her.
House : Why go back to that well? In the nine years since Wilson's party,
House : a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers.
Amber : She loved cats.
UNK: Why would you remember that a stripper loved cats?
Amber : Chase has a cat, they'll bond.
UNK: He's gonna go through life deaf.
House : He's okay with that.
Amber : He has no idea what he's missing.
Amber : His mom's a moron. He's gonna pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life?
UNK: Are we okay with that?
Chase : Let's get an implant tray in here.
Chase : Just try to relax.
Cuddy : Her son didn't want the implant.
House : If he still doesn't want it, after having time to adjust, I'll take it out.
