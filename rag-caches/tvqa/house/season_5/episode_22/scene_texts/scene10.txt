House : Is he okay?
Foreman : One of the residents had an EpiPen, so he's fine.
Foreman : But we're taking him to the hospital to be safe.
UNK: Okay.
House : I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn't I?
House : That's why you wanted Karamel at this party.
Amber : I suggested Karamel 'cause she was great at Wilson's party.
House : I knew about her body butter, I knew about his strawberry allergy.
House : I tried to kill Chase?
House : Why would I do that? I don't want Cameron.
Amber : You're not a big fan of other people's happiness either.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: You confirm? Thanks.
House : That kid we saved, he's dying.
House : It's not MS.
Foreman : We were wrong.
Cameron : Thank God you're okay. What happened?
UNK: There was a girl...
Foreman : Long story.
UNK: Your patient's lung failure rules out MS. We put him on a ventilator.
