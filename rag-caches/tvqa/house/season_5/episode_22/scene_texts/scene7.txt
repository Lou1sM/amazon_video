House : Spoken like a true Aussie.
House : Hey! Want some ice cream? We're having a sundae bar.
UNK: Sweet.
Amber : That's her name!
House : Sundae or Bar?
UNK: Karamel.
House : With a "K."
UNK: Bathroom?
Thirteen : Down the hall, two doors, on your right.
UNK: Thanks.
Seth : Do I sound like her?
Thirteen : It takes time.
Taub : You still haven't slept?
House : And then I have a clever response.
Foreman : EKG, normal sinus, normal intervals. His heart's fine.
Foreman : His heart's not fine.
House : The heart was fine during this test. The arrhythmia's hiding.
Foreman : Or we were wrong about the heart.
Taub : Could be the thyroid.
Thirteen : Hashimoto's would explain the kid's urine and brain pressure.
UNK: Treadmill.
House : Or the arrhythmia is hiding.
House : We need to stress him. Put the patient on a treadmill.
Foreman : The patient just had brain surgery.
Foreman : A stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill him.
House : I value your opinion. I value rejecting your opinion.
Foreman : You're not doing this. You haven't been sleeping...
House : Cuddy doesn't actually want you in charge.
House : She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.
Foreman : And if I let you risk our patient's life testing an organ we already tested,
Foreman : we accomplish neither. Run a thyroid panel.
House : How do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman's sign off?
Amber : We could kill Foreman. Is she new?
UNK: Focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it's not simulated?
Amber : We could tell him his girlfriend dumped him.
UNK: It's a tough sell since she never leaves the room for more than five minutes.
Amber : We could kill her.
Amber : Or asthma meds. Force the heart to beat faster.
House : Revealing the arrhythmia.
House : Nice idea.
Amber : It was yours.
Ellie : I just left the room for a few minutes.
Thirteen : He ripped out his implant. So much for improving his life.
Amber : Actually, I think we just saved it.
