UNK: We have now gone 18 days without an injury in the workplace.
House : Yes, these girls are all working their way through law school, don't test them.
UNK: House!
House : I knew you couldn't stay away.
Wilson : This is my apartment! You can't do this.
House : Clearly reality begs to differ.
Wilson : Where's my furniture?
House : Out back somewhere.
UNK: James!
UNK: Karamel?
UNK: Hey.
Karamel : How's your wife?

UNK: How about we go have a drink?
Karamel : This way. Okay.
Wilson : You're okay with this?
Foreman : I paid 50 bucks for this.
Wilson : You guys are great together. Trust is everything.
UNK: I'm gonna get some air. Keep it real.
Amber : You should be out there, enjoying the lap dances of your labors.
UNK: I kind of like it in here.
Amber : Me, too.
Amber : To us, figuring out MS.
House : And the blindness and neuropathy, and arrhythmia, and anything else we did.
House : What exactly did my team do?
Amber : Looked good in their lab coats, except for Taub.
Amber : Some people just work better alone, so to speak.
Foreman : One more drink.
Chase : No. I can't. I gotta take a break.
Taub : Meet Karamel.
Chase : Maybe one more drink.
Chase : What's that taste? Is that strawberry?
Foreman : House, you in there?
House : Use the other bathroom. It's in the kitchen, looks like a sink.
Foreman : Chase went into anaphylactic shock from the stripper's body butter or something.
