House : Tell him to pick up some morphine. No need for the patient to be in pain.
Taub : He's on morphine. No, he's on saline.
UNK: I figured you'd put him on saline, so I switched him back to morphine.
House : I love you. When you reach puberty, give me a...
House : I was right. He is being poisoned.
House : What's this density on his hip?
Cameron : Just bone. Think less boney.
Cameron : You think he's got lead poisoning?
House : Explains the constipation, the nerves, seizures. Hold him down.
House : You're not gonna feel a thing, except excruciating pain.
UNK: Your mugger used hollow points, which exploded and left fragments.
House : and then, biggie, you started to dissolve.
Cameron : I'll start him on chelation. The agoraphobia, could it...
UNK: Nope. The lead wouldn't have started to disintegrate till years after.
Cameron : But it could have exacerbated the fear.
Stewart : I don't need to change.
Cameron : I know you think that but your life could be better, you'd have choices.
House : He's lying. About what?
House : About everything. About his life.
House : He doesn't even think he's happy here. He's miserable.
Stewart : I've got everything I need. Yeah?
House : Well, then why did Taub find rose petals in your entry hallway?
House : Struck me as a little weird, thought it might be medically relevant.
House : But it actually just told me that you were pathetic.
House : The day you crashed in your entryway was your girlfriend's birthday.
House : You weren't there for the mail, you were trying to go lay flowers on her grave.
House : Yeah, he's got PTSD, yeah, he's agoraphobic.
UNK: But he's also a coward.
UNK: If you want to change your life, do something.
House : Don't believe your own rationalizations.
UNK: Don't just lock yourself up and pretend you're happy.
UNK: Hi. Hi.
Taub : You were right.
Cameron : About my husband. It affected me.
Cameron : It still affects me.
Chase : If you're saying you'll never be able to...
Cameron : I cleaned out a drawer for you.
Cameron : Like, a big one.
