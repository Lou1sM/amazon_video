UNK: Oh...
Wilson : Have you considered that it's not my place you really wanna be walking into right now?
UNK: Ric Ocasek will kill me if I... Oh, you mean Cuddy.
Wilson : Yeah, she's a little nuts, but she's beautiful, smart, funny.
Wilson : And most important, she can stand you.
House : Yeah. I came here to have you lecture me on Cuddy,
House : not because there's a killer mosquito chasing me around my apartment.
Wilson : House, there is no mosquito.
Wilson : This is all about Cuddy.
UNK: She's "bugging" me. Poetic.
Wilson : Have you seen this bug?
House : Have you seen this bite?
Wilson : No, what I've seen is a suppurating wound
Wilson : that you've scratched and mutilated into a gangrenous state.
Wilson : Delusional parasitosis.
House : I am not imagining things.
Wilson : House, you're a drug addict, you're always imagining things.
Wilson : You got bitten the night you kissed her.
Wilson : Your itching always gets worse when you think about her.
Wilson : You need to address this.
House : She's my boss.
Wilson : No, you're not afraid of authority, you're afraid she actually is right for you.
Wilson : You're afraid to take a chance
Wilson : because it's too big a chance.
House : If it doesn't work with her,
Wilson : then maybe there's no one out there.
House : I am not rationalizing. I'm better off alone.
UNK: Also, have you seen her ass recently?
Wilson : You're not staying here.
House : Oh, come on.
Wilson : No. You can go home, or...
Wilson : You're going to Cuddy's, you're gonna ring her doorbell,
Wilson : and you're gonna ask her out on a date, like regular people do.
UNK: At 3 : 00 in the morning?
UNK: When do regular people sleep?
UNK: Bye-bye.
House : Is he in enough pain to come in yet?
UNK: No.
Cameron : Antibody tests back?
UNK: Inconclusive.
Cameron : Then why are you here? I missed you.
UNK: Endoscopy? Inconclusive.
House : Well, then do it again.
Cameron : I know it sucks, but I need to test your stomach again.
Stewart : It's really hurting. I know, I'm sorry.
UNK: I'm gonna try to get you on your back and have you open your mouth.
Cameron : He's out.
UNK: Anything? No pulse.
House : Start CPR.
Cameron : Get the paddles. Get the paddles.
Cameron : Who are you calling?
UNK: Pizza. You like anchovies?
House : I'm calling the lawyer. Genuine emergency, he'll okay admission.
Cameron : He's dying.
UNK: Exactly.
House : Hi, sorry to wake you. Your introvert is having a heart attack.
Cameron : House, if we don't restart his heart... He can survive 15 minutes
House : on oxygen and CPR. We can get him to the hospital in five.
House : Lawyer says yes. Continue CPR.
House : 2123, Holden Green, patient with PEA.
UNK: Clear. Wait.
Cameron : I got a pulse.
Cameron : Cancel the ambulance. He's stable enough to stay here.
Foreman : His heart's back to sinus rhythm, but it's bradycardic.
