UNK: No, but she also didn't cheat on you.
UNK: House continues : Normally, sperm meets egg,
UNK: House continues : That's normally.
UNK: House continues : Abnormally, an egg could have two naturally occurring gene mutations
UNK: House continues : that don't naturally occur together.
UNK: Parthenogenesis. A baby without a daddy.
UNK: House continues : In humans, it's only ever been theorized, and it was never proved.
UNK: House continues : Until now.
UNK: House continues : Mommy, baby. Your daughter has only maternal DNA.
UNK: House continues : I personally checked this five times. In seven months, you will have
UNK: House continues : a virgin birth.
UNK: House continues : Merry Christmas.
UNK: I've got to tell you about this clinic patient.
Cuddy : Natalie's liver's continuing to fail. And now bradycardia.
Cuddy : Atropine isn't keeping the heart rate up,
UNK: we're going to have to put her on a pacemaker.
House : Alcohol withdrawal would cause her heart to race, not crawl.
Kutner : There's nothing structurally wrong with her heart.
Kutner : EKG, echo, electrolyte panel are all normal.
Cuddy : Multiple endocrine syndrome?
Thirteen : Free T4's normal. Hypothalamic brain tumor?
Taub : Didn't come up on the CT scan.
House : It's hitting all her organs. Could be the blood. What's her Alk-Phos?
UNK: Three hundred.
Cuddy : It can't be leukemia.
UNK: High Alk-Phos could also be from liver failure.
Cuddy : She's a teenager, means bone growth and destruction could throw it off.
Wilson : Maybe. But it's higher than you'd expect.
Wilson : Start her on chemo.
UNK: We'll do a bone marrow biopsy to confirm.
Cuddy : Why are you ordering tests instead of treatment?
Cuddy : Her heart and liver are about to give up. Do whatever you need to.
Cuddy : Why are you so attached to this girl?
House : It's your call.
Cuddy : He doesn't want us to treat her.
Wilson : If it's leukemia, even if we kill every cancer cell,
Cuddy : her heart and liver are too far gone.
Cuddy : A double transplant.
Wilson : With brain involvement? The committee won't even open the file.
Wilson : There's no reason to put a dying girl
Wilson : through a painful treatment if it can't save her.
Wilson : He's being kind.
Cuddy : I'll arrange a biopsy.
Foreman : Mrs. Burke?
Foreman : We're conducting another trial in tandem with yours.
Foreman : Same drug, lower dose.
UNK: The nausea would be less.
Foreman : I did some checking, I can switch you.
Foreman : Here's the forms if you want back in.
Cuddy : What if we're wrong?
Kutner : Maybe we shouldn't have overlooked autoimmunes.
Cuddy : High sed rate.
House : We went over this.
Thirteen : Normal complement level.
Cuddy : So it isn't hepatic fibrosis, it could still be microangiopathic vasculitis.
