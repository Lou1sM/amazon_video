Foreman : Hey, you and Cameron... I'm sorry.
Chase : I'll be right back.
UNK: I don't want to be homeless.
Chase : Okay. You can stay in the condo. I'll find some other...
Cameron : That's not what I mean.
UNK: I want to marry you. I got the forms to destroy the sperm.
Chase : You sure?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I want to hug you, but then I'd have to re-scrub.
Wilson : I know.
UNK: BP is dropping.
UNK: Go.
Foreman : No sign of cancer. BP is 90 over 60.
Wilson : You never answered my question.
House : Relax. Our friendship is not doomed.
Wilson : Thank God. But my question was, do you really want Cuddy,
Wilson : or is this just another challenge?
House : You're worried that once I'm in a relationship,
House : you and me will be over.
Wilson : Hey, I'm actually for this. I think this is great.
Wilson : But if you're serious, and you don't treat it seriously, then you will get hurt.
Wilson : And if you don't accept that, then accept that she will get hurt.
Stripper : I was told it was your birthday.
Cuddy : I understand.
Scott : So, so sorry.
Wilson : I know.
Stripper : Clearly, there was a mix-up.
Cuddy : Have a nice day.
UNK: Does she look angry?
Wilson : If you're standing there when she looks up here...
House : Oh, no.
Foreman : Systolic's 80.
Chase : Gotta finish this suture before I can get out.
Foreman : Give him a dopamine drip.
Foreman : Get to your point. We're a little busy here.
Foreman : We echoed the heart. No clots.
Chase : No arrhythmia.
Foreman : We have to get his BP stable.
Foreman : Systolic's 70.
UNK: Wow.
