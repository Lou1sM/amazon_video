House : I would have done it in the year he spent dying.

House : I'm in pain.
UNK: One?

House : but it won't give me enough relief
House : for an escape back to Plainsboro.

Thirteen : She's an addict. Drugs and alcohol wouldn't...
Thirteen : She's a smoker.
Thirteen : Combine smoking with any one of a dozen genetic disorders

UNK: Cane. The restroom's right there.
Wilson : You can make it on your own.
House : I suppose I could talk about the summer

House : and slipped under my bedroom door.
Wilson : You don't want to say anything, don't say anything, but go.
Wilson : Tell your mom you're sad. For her.
House : Just by being there I'd be lying.
Wilson : She wants to think, for a moment, that she had a happy family.
Wilson : So give her a gift. Lie.
House : Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral.
