UNK: Shockingly, none of the nurses
Cuddy : volunteered to administer yours.
Cuddy : It goes better in a large muscle.
Cuddy : Drop your pants.
House : You know, I usually pay tens of dollars to hear that.
Cuddy : The funeral's tomorrow.
House : My mom called you?
UNK: There is a 3 : 40 flight out of Newark.
UNK: If you leave now, you can be in Lexington tonight.
UNK: Your mother wants you to deliver a eulogy.
UNK: Eulogy, from the Greek for "good word."
UNK: Now if she'd asked me to deliver a bastardogy, I'd be happy to...
Cuddy : Then be a grownup. Call your mother back
UNK: and tell her you're sick with grief,
Cuddy : but you're too busy to be there.
House : She knows when I'm lying.
Cuddy : Then start writing.
UNK: I yanked my brother and sister out of college?
Nicole : Can you please tell them I'm not dying?
Kutner : You have SARS. I'm wearing a mask.
Kutner : It's a big deal. Cut them some slack.
UNK: But I am going to be okay, right?
Kutner : That's what all this stuff is for.
Kutner : We're gonna need the names and numbers
Kutner : of everyone you came in contact with
Kutner : here and in China. Flight numbers, dates.
Nicole : That doctor that I coughed all over, is he gonna be all right?
Kutner : So far, he's fine.
Nicole : It's back. This is where the pain all started.
UNK: She's tachycardiac. Get a crash cart in here!
Janice : What's going on?
Janice : I need to know what's going on. That's my daughter.
Kutner : Her liver's failing. It's not SARS.
Wilson : I am not doing this because I care.
House : Cuddy drugged me. She...
House : My mom didn't call Cuddy. She called you.
House : I knew you couldn't stay away.
House : I knew you loved me too much.
