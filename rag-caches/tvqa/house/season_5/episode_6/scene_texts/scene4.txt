Cameron : Good fetal movement, heart's beating nicely.
UNK: What?
Cameron : It looks like pulmonary hypoplasia.
Becca : What's that?
Cuddy : The baby's lungs are underdeveloped.
Cuddy : She won't be able to breathe on her own.
Becca : She might die? I don't know.
Cameron : If she was born today, she'd be in trouble,
UNK: but we're not going to let that happen.
Cameron : We'll put you on magnesium to prevent labor,
Cameron : and steroids to grow the lungs.
Cameron : It's a good thing Dr. Cuddy brought you in.
Taub : How do you know what a drug dealer looks like?
Thirteen : I'm not doing drugs, if that's what you're asking.
Thirteen : I just noticed that she had cash in her hand. Obviously came from him.
Thirteen : Obviously didn't have enough time to perform any other services.
Taub : I didn't notice her holding any...
UNK: Mmm. There she is.
Taub : We're not cops.
Taub : Cops aren't allowed to say that, right?
Sadie : Yeah, they can say it.
UNK: Oh!
Sadie : But if you were a cop, you'd know that. What do you want?
Taub : I'd like to buy some cocaine, please.
UNK: Definitely not a cop.
Samantha : Thank you.
UNK: Wait.
House : It's good. Glad you like it, Pablo. Now can we go?
Thirteen : No. You gave us the wrong stuff.
Sadie : What are you talking about? You got my best.
Thirteen : I know. I don't want the good, "get the new customer hooked" stuff.
UNK: I want the stepped-on, "keep the old customer coming back for more" stuff.
Sadie : Are you crazy, bitch?
UNK: No, I'm just a bitch who knows what she wants.
House : Looks like this kid thing is really working out for you.
