UNK: Clear. Nothing. Go again.
UNK: Clear. He's back.
Chase : Foreman, we're there.
Thirteen : Chelation's complete. You're arsenic-free.
UNK: So, I can get out of here?
Thirteen : In the morning.
Sophia : That's it? No advice? No, "Be careful out there, kiddo"?
Thirteen : You want my advice?
Sophia : Want is one thing, expect is another.
Thirteen : I wish I could tell you what to do.
Thirteen : But you're strong. You've made good choices. You'll be fine.
UNK: Thanks.
Thirteen : Need four milligrams of Lorazepam.
Thirteen : After the seizure, we ran a new MRI.
Thirteen : This is Sophia's brain three days ago, this is her brain today.
UNK: Lesions.
Kutner : Magical lesions, which appear out of nowhere.
House : She was cured, then she wasn't.
Thirteen : Lesions grew too fast for cancer.
Taub : Could be infection, MRSA.
Thirteen : WBC count would be through the roof.
House : Put the arsenic back.
Taub : You wanna treat a patient nearly poisoned to death by giving her more poison?
House : Just because we call something a poison doesn't mean it's bad for you.
Thirteen : It was killing her.
House : But since she's still dying, the arsenic, obviously, wasn't killing her.
House : And since she's now getting worse, the arsenic was obviously fighting the killer.
House : It's a hero. We should be organizing a parade.
Taub : So, what does arsenic treat?
Kutner : Syphilis. Before penicillin, the treatment was arsenic.
Taub : We already ruled out STDs, and even if we were wrong,
Taub : that much arsenic in her system would have wiped out the syphilis.
Thirteen : Acute promyelocytic leukemia is still treated with arsenic.
