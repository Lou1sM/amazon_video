Secretary : Mr. Taub?
House : I've been waiting 15 minutes. Where's Neil?
Secretary : Neil doesn't work here anymore.
UNK: But he's the CEO.
Secretary : I'm sorry. I wish I could help you. Sorry.
Taub : This is crazy. I'm investing with his company.
Secretary : He doesn't have a company.
Secretary : He worked here, but he was a receptionist, a temp.
Taub : Where is he? He's in custody.
Secretary : I really am not supposed to say anything else.
Morgan : I went to high school with him.
Secretary : That's what everyone else thought, too.
Secretary : I'm guessing you also cured his ear problem?
Secretary : Did you give him the money yet?
UNK: No.
Taub : I was right,
House : and more satisfyingly, you were wrong.
UNK: It was coincidence.
UNK: That cat was not predicting deaths,
House : it was just trying to keep warm.
Wilson : Yes, dead people are renowned for their warm glow.
Taub : They are if they're feverish,
House : like three of the patients were.
