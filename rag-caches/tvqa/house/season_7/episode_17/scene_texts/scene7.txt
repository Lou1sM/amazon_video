Masters : Danny said his left arm felt like it was on fire last night.
Masters : We assumed it was a schizophrenic delusion, but...
House : It's not. He's on clozapine.
House : He'd be getting better, not worse.
Chase : Sounds like regional pain syndrome.
Chase : Has to be a genetic disorder.
Foreman : Would you slow down? You're gonna get us arrested.
Taub : I wouldn't worry about it. We'll probably die first.
House : Don't make me take my shoe off!
Foreman : We need to run his DNA. He could have early onset of Parkinson's.
House : Or cortical-based ganglionic degeneration,
House : or Huntington's or any one of a dozen other genetic diseases.
Masters : If you let us out, we can start testing.
UNK: If you're gonna test for them all, it'll take weeks.
House : I'm not canceling my honeymoon to treat this kid.
Taub : It's a fake marriage, but a real honeymoon?
House : Most are.
Foreman : Danny could also have died before
Foreman : we get through testing for all the possibilities.
House : So we cheat. Since it's genetic,
House : daddy or mommy's got it, too.
House : They're either sick or dead.
Masters : He doesn't know where his mother is,
Masters : and he won't tell us where his father is.
House : He's a homeless ex-junkie.
House : You telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him?
House : Green light!
House : Cuddy got it for me.
UNK: I'm now drafting a request for studying the effects of caffeine
House : involving an Italian espresso machine
House : and a massage chair. Make it quick.
Taub : I found Danny's father.
House : Well done.
Taub : Kid said he was in a state-sponsored rehab last November.
