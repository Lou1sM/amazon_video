House : Why aren't you guys in my office?
UNK: Why are you in the building?
UNK: It's 8 : 00 in the morning.
House : Where's Chase?
UNK: He's not here because it's 8 : 00 in the morning.
UNK: Sixteen-year-old girl, high fever, vomiting, bloodshot eyes.
Taub : Wow, the case of the really bad flu.
House : Hmm. Let me see. Did I leave anything out?
House : Oh, yeah. The smallpox.
Masters : Smallpox was eradicated over 30 years ago.
House : So were Hush Puppies. Did you check out
House : your local hipster coffee shop lately?
Foreman : Smallpox doesn't exist outside of P4 labs and bio weapon plants.
Foreman : She was in Bermuda...
House : Where she was scuba-diving
House : on the wreck of a Dutch slave ship
House : that had been intentionally sunk
House : because an epidemic of smallpox had broken out onboard.
Foreman : Was the ship sunk in water?
Foreman : Because viruses can't survive contact with water.
UNK: And if the virus had been kept on the outside of an airtight jar,
House : that might be an issue.
House : The jar held old-school inoculations.
House : They kept the scabs of the infected people.
Taub : The virus can't survive over 200 years...
House : You have.
House : Thanks for calling back. Listen, I'm a screenwriter.
House : And is it theoretically possible for smallpox
House : to survive for more than 200 years
House : underwater in a sealed glass jar?
Captain : Thank you.
House : So who do we believe, the CDC or Dr. 90210?
UNK: Isolate, get the baseline blood draws for smallpox antibodies,
UNK: then vaccinate the entire family.
Foreman : We should test for the 21st century suspects.
UNK: Varicella, measles...
House : You're free to perform whatever
House : unnecessary tests you want, Foreman.
House : Slavery was abolished years ago.
