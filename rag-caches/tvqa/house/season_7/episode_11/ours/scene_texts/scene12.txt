Cuddy : What are you doing?
House : You really want me to stop and explain?
House : There it is. Look at that.
Cuddy : The muscle's black.
UNK: Necrosis?

House : It's cobalt poisoning.
UNK: We're gonna need Chase to get an OR.
UNK: We should start chelation again.
Taub : I thought you didn't want to see me.
Taub : I didn't.
UNK: But Foreman called me.
Rachel : I didn't know that you thought
Rachel : that little boy had a bleed in his head.
Rachel : I will kill my brother if he messes with you anymore.
Taub : What do you care?
Rachel : Chris. You were a crappy husband.
Rachel : But you are a good person.
House : Once again. You are unfired.
UNK: Why?
House : You sold me out even though you knew
House : that you're gonna get thrown out of med school.
House : That's just kind of impressive.
Masters : I keep my job if I stand up to you, I keep it if I don't.
Masters : I don't buy it.
House : When Cuddy was protecting me before, she was protecting a doctor.
House : She's now protecting a boyfriend.
House : The hospital's not gonna put up with that for long.
House : So I need you to protect me
House : from doing something Cuddy will regret.
House : See you bright and late tomorrow.
Julia : Mom, why would you want to keep this?
Arlene : So I can mount it on the wall like a moose head.
Arlene : It says here, "Cobalt can cause rashes,
UNK: "dizziness and stomach problems."
Arlene : You still think I've been imagining the whole thing?
Cuddy : Okay, you might have a point.
Cuddy : How do you feel?
Arlene : You know, a little dizziness, some pain.
