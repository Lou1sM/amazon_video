House : We push through this.
House : Started in the heart, endocarditis still fits, it's just got to be fungal.
House : We have to switch Kaufman's antibiotics for Amphotericin B.
Foreman : I don't know if you're right, I don't care.
Foreman : But we are gonna end up killing this woman
Foreman : if we keep confusing her attending with these secret meds.
House : I don't care about confusing the attending. I want this woman...
Foreman : We're not talking about simple antibiotics anymore.
Foreman : Amphotericin B is dangerous in itself. It's a poison.
Foreman : That's why it kills fungi. It'll give her fever, chills...
House : Which she already has, which will help us hide it.
Cuddy : I don't think I can take a risk like that.
House : Well, then, you shouldn't have let her fire me!
House : Look, all you have to do is switch the IVs again.
Cuddy : This has blown up on you once already.
Taub : He's right.
UNK: Yep.
Cuddy : I'm so sorry I got you guys into this. You should go.
House : I'm right.
Julia : I know. And I'll do it, but...
Masters : I agree. Fungal endocarditis fits.
Masters : But we still have to tell your mother.
Arlene : I don't want to tell her, not at all,
Masters : but the patient is the highest priority.
House : I'm kicking you out of your office.
House : Yes, you. This is not her office yet.
House : If you tell anyone,
House : I will get you thrown out of med school
House : and I will destroy your career.
Masters : I've thought about that.
Masters : Lying about me won't work.
Masters : Everybody knows your reputation.
House : True. But I won't have to lie.
House : Buried in your coma patient's big, big file is a form
House : that doesn't allow treatment without
UNK: the express consent of the relatives.
UNK: Wait... You drew blood.
House : That's not just a screw-up. It's a criminal assault.
Masters : But you told me...
House : No. As you may recall...
Masters : You set me up?
UNK: Why?
House : Because this patient is the highest priority.
