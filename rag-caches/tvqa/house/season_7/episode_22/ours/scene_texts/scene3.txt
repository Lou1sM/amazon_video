Thirteen : What if her body used up all the clotting factors
Thirteen : dealing with the stab wound?
Chase : Explains the bloody mass.
Chase : But if you're right, she could start bleeding anywhere.
Chase : Like, in her brain or in her heart.
UNK: Wait, one of those things could start growing in my brain?
Chase : It's time to get you to the hospital.
UNK: No. Remy, you promised.
Thirteen : All we'll do at the hospital is stick her in a patient bed
Thirteen : and give her IV clotting factor.
Thirteen : We can do that right here.
Chase : We could also embalm her right here.
Thirteen : I'll call the drugs and you go pick them up.
Thirteen : If I'm right, she'll be fine.
Thirteen : Look, I know you don't know her
Thirteen : and you don't care about her, but I do.
UNK: Please.
Thirteen : Lie down, elevate your shoulder.
Thirteen : You said Andre wasn't responsible for the drugs. What is?
Taub : I don't know.
Thirteen : Yes, you do. What happened to you?
Thirteen : If you don't deal with the real problem...
Darrien : I came here because you were a doctor,
Darrien : not a shrink.
