Thirteen : When I was 10 or 11, my dad used to take us to this county fair,
Thirteen : and there was this kid.
UNK: What?
House : Who's "us"?
Thirteen : My mom and me.
UNK: House [figuring Something Out] : Your mom, who had advanced-stage Huntington's.
UNK: House [figuring Something Out] : You have a sibling, which you've never mentioned.
UNK: House [figuring Something Out] : Why did you slip up now?
Thirteen : Not everything means something.
Thirteen : We're gonna be up soon. I wanna check the pressure.
House : You don't wake up in the middle of the night to cry over a dead stranger.
House : You don't confess to killing a man and then hide the details
House : unless the details reveal more about you than the crime itself.
House : You pled down to drugs,
House : you've got a horrible genetic disease
House : and a sibling who's suddenly on your mind.
House : You euthanized your brother.
UNK: And the guy back at the house was the doctor
House : who wouldn't help you cover it up.
House : Guy back at the house, he's my cellmate's boyfriend.
UNK: Thirteen [holding Back Her Tears] : He cheated on her when she was inside.
House : But I was right about everything else?
UNK: Congratulations.
Taub : You're mad.
UNK: No.
Foreman : Actually, I'm impressed.
Foreman : Messing around on a 22-year-old hottie with your wife, on my sofa.
Foreman : You're a full-throttle head case.
Taub : I was doing you a solid with the sofa.
Taub : Rachel wanted to do it in your bed.
Taub : You've got the memory foam top.
UNK: Let's make this really simple.
UNK: If I own it, I don't want you doing it on it.
UNK: You might wanna get rid of your kitchen table.
Taub : Look, I'm sorry. But it was worth it.
Foreman : Yeah, I bet.
Foreman : You get to mess with her physically and emotionally.
Taub : I still care about her.
Foreman : Not enough to let her move on with her life.
UNK: And while we're talking about your bad ideas,
UNK: MRI is clean.
Masters : There has to be some kind of inciting psychological incident.
Chase : This is perfect for you.
Chase : You get all the human interaction you crave
Chase : without any actual human interaction.
UNK: She was a cheerleader. Hah.
Chase : You know, when you're interested in something and nobody else is,
Chase : the polite thing is to keep it to yourself.
Masters : Popular, beautiful, gregarious.
UNK: Hydrogen sulphide is about two parts per billion, the size of a healthy fart.
Chase : I'll be back for you in July.
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : He couldn't do it himself.
UNK: Thirteen [holding Back Her Tears] : He was...
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : The disease had progressed too far.
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : He was flailing,
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : he didn't have any control over his own body.
UNK: He'd pretty much lost control of his mind, too,
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : but every once in a while, he would have a few seconds of lucidity.
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : He turned to me, and he said,
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : "It's time."
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : I hooked up the IV,
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : I used gloves. I knew they'd get me on the drugs,
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : but they couldn't prove who pushed the plunger.
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : I put in the needle, and he just
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : got quiet.
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : And it was over.
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : And I was alone.
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : And one day, I will be that sick,
UNK: Thirteen [with Red Eyes From All The Crying] : and there will be no one there when it's time.
UNK: Thirteen [letting The Anger Come In] : I didn't expect compassion from you.
UNK: I would've taken commiseration.
UNK: Hell, I would've taken revulsion.
UNK: Thirteen [letting The Anger Come In] : Any emotional engagement at all.
UNK: Thirteen [letting The Anger Come In] : It's no wonder Cuddy broke up with you.
Harold : Dumped in a field in Schenectady. Ouch!
