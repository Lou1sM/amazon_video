Foreman : Ruby, right?
UNK: Yeah.
Foreman : Hey, how are you liking PPTH?
Ruby : It's great. Everyone's so friendly.
Foreman : Yeah. Especially Dr. Taub.
Foreman : Don't worry. I'm not gonna bust your chops. I just wanna know one thing.
Foreman : How did he get you to go out with him?
UNK: Why? Is there something...
UNK: No, no, no. He's great.
Foreman : You know, I'm just asking because...
Foreman : Well, he's...
UNK: Um...
Foreman : You know what? Never mind. It's none of my business.
Foreman : You guys have fun tonight.
Ruby : I'm not seeing him tonight.
Ruby : We had plans but, he canceled.
Thirteen : This thing's got no fuel valve.
Thirteen : Means you can't regulate the input.
Thirteen : What is this? A barbeque lighter?
Thirteen : Your gun sucks.
UNK: We should treat this like an archeological dig.
UNK: Grid the site, excavate, catalog, analyze.
Chase : You like it here?
UNK: What, you don't think this is fascinating?
Chase : Not nearly as fascinating as the fact that you think it's fascinating.
Masters : But this guy kept everything he ever came into contact with.
Masters : An interactive life history.
Chase : It's an indiscriminate pile of rubbish.
UNK: Mmm.
Masters : For the most part, so are our lives.
UNK: Chase [checking Readings On His Beeping Monitor] : There's no carbon monoxide.
UNK: Chase [checking Readings On His Beeping Monitor] : A bit of a blow to Foreman's exposure hypothesis.
UNK: Chase [checking Readings On His Beeping Monitor] : And my plan to get out of here quickly.
Masters : Maybe we don't just figure out the "what," we figure out the "why."
Masters : Then, maybe...
UNK: Chase [throws Something To Masters] : From the size and the undigested seeds,
UNK: Chase [throws Something To Masters] : I'm guessing this came from a raccoon.
Masters : If you're thinking Q fever,
Masters : it fits.
Chase : So, why are you still looking?
UNK: Well, we only found one thing.
UNK: And it fits perfectly.
Masters : Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's...
UNK: Chase?
Taub : You missed something at his place.
Chase : His wife.
UNK: Nina.
Nina : I didn't know where you were.
Brian : I'm so sorry. I couldn't get home.
Thirteen : You okay?
Chase : We think you both have Q fever.
UNK: We found raccoon feces in the kitchen cupboard.
Chase : We're gonna start you on doxycycline.
Taub : Why wouldn't you tell us you're married?
Brian : Fewer people who know about it, the easier it is.
Nina : When can I go back?
Brian : She gets anxious when she's away from her things.
Masters : She's the hoarder. He just lives there.
Taub : On purpose?
Brian : She's my wife.
