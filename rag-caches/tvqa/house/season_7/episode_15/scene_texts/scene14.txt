House : Guess who doesn't have cancer?
UNK: Me.
House : Also, you.
House : Actually, you for sure. Me...
UNK: House...
UNK: The tumor was benign.
UNK: It was an oncocytoma.
UNK: They got it out, you'll be fine.
Cuddy : Then what was in my lungs?
UNK: Well, once they ruled out cancer,
House : I remembered that your mom was allergic to antibiotics,
House : so I had them test your blood.
House : Your IgE levels were through the roof.
House : Because the lung masses were an allergic reaction.
UNK: So, now that you're off the antibiotics,
House : your lungs should clear right up.
UNK: And I brought you something.
UNK: Say hello to your tumor. Oh!
UNK: Wait.
