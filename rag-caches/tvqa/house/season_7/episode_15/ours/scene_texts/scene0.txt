UNK: House?
Cuddy : Oh, my God!
Cuddy : What the hell?
UNK: Gotcha. Did you actually wake up early
Cuddy : and hide under the bed just to scare the crap out of me?
House : Set an alarm and everything.
Cuddy : It's like dating a 10-year-old.
House : God, I hope not.
House : Now that we're down here...
Cuddy : Hold that thought.
UNK: Seriously?
Cuddy : I have to pee.
House : I'll wait. I brought a book.
House : Didn't know what time your alarm was set for.
UNK: House?
UNK: You know, you could rent this space out down here.

Cuddy : House, shut up.
