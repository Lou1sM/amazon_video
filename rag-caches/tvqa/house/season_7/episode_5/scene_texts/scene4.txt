House : How about I stay the night? And you can really thank me.
Cuddy : I have to get up early. You won't be able to sleep in.
House : I'm a deep sleeper.
Taub : Round two. Did Justine go home?
UNK: She said she was going downstairs for a few minutes.
Abbey : A few hours ago.
Taub : So you two are close.
Abbey : It's been getting better, actually.
Abbey : At least she's here in the building.
Abbey : That's pretty supportive for her.
Abbey : What is it?
Taub : She's pinker.
Abbey : Is that bad?
Taub : That's good.
Taub : That's very good.
UNK: Is that her?
Abbey : Can I hold her?
Taub : I think it's long overdue.
UNK: Oh!
Abbey : My first time.
UNK: Finally.
UNK: Technically, it's your second time.
Taub : I didn't mean... I know, Mom.
Taub : Looks like it was a vascular malformation. The Grogan baby is better.
UNK: Dr. Cheng : Nice job.
UNK: Dr. Cheng : Okay, ready, honey. So stay very, very still.
UNK: Dr. Cheng : And hold your breath. Don't move.
Cheng : She moved. They always move.
Taub : It is a good job.
UNK: Diagnostics. Solve a mystery, save a life.
Taub : But I suppose you're pretty attached to pediatrics.
UNK: And now the mom's not gonna want to do it,
Cheng : because she'd rather I just keep blasting her daughter with radiation.
UNK: You're telling me there's an opening in House's department?
Taub : Would you be interested?
Cheng : No more kids? No more parents?
UNK: One case at a time instead of 17? Set up the interview.
Taub : It's possible you won't need to interview.
House : Relax, I got this.
UNK: Thanks.
Cuddy : Is everything okay?
House : Yeah. Sorry. Just new to all this.
