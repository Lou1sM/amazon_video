House : Dominika is a licensed esthetician.
Cuddy : You cut open your own leg!
House : So all this was about you?
Cuddy : You don't think it was even related?
Cuddy : House, we've never even had a conversation about our breakup.
Cuddy : You are obviously still angry at me,
Cuddy : and it's hurting both of us.
