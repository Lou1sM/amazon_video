Cuddy : It's Mother's Day Sunday.
Cuddy : We can't have five minutes alone to fix this?
Arlene : Relax, you can still bill me for the time standing in the hallway.
Cuddy : I know you're mad at me, but you can barely make it up those stairs.
Cuddy : How many nights have you spent on your couch?
Arlene : This has nothing to do with our fight.
Cuddy : We're talking about my home, not a prison camp.
Arlene : What did I just say? I think it was something about this not being personal.
Cuddy : You can spend time with Rachel, I can watch over you.
UNK: Win-win.
Arlene : Maybe I've got a medical thing,
Arlene : maybe I just think I'm talking
Arlene : but no one can hear me, not just my uncaring daughter.
Cuddy : What do you want? 20 grand.
Arlene : I'll hire help and forget this nightmare you put me through.
Arlene : Make it 30. I'll put in a stair-lift.
Cuddy : If my board even hears about these threats, let alone a settlement,
Cuddy : they'll investigate what happened
Cuddy : while you were here as a patient.
Cuddy : House and I could both lose our licenses.
Cuddy : I've been assuming this is personal,
UNK: because I don't wanna assume that that's what my mother wants.
