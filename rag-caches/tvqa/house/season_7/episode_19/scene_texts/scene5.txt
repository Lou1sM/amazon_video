Masters : I care about the patient.
Masters : I told her dad I was gonna take care of her.
Taub : - RA is 8. - Equalization of pressures.
UNK: I think she has restrictive pericarditis.
Chase : Add that to a calcified pineal gland...
UNK: When it's a granuloma.
Thirteen : It's Wegener's. We should start her on steroids.
Masters : - But she had a high CK. - Wegener's wouldn't explain that...
Taub : Dehydration does.
Masters : Yes. But the calcified pineal could be sarcoidosis.
Masters : I'm not back!
Masters : I'll just be staying for this case.
Simpson : Hope it was one hell of a whiz.
Masters : I ran into Dr. House.
Masters : He requested a surgical consult for his patient.
Simpson : House never asks for a consult.
Masters : Something about this case, he needed a little more help.
Simpson : First day of your surgical internship,
Simpson : you want to be loaned out to another department.
Simpson : Interesting career move.
Simpson : Drop the form by my office.

Cruz : How about I take both you lovely ladies out for a drink?

Masters : I didn't take...
UNK: Oh.
Masters : That's funny.
Masters : I'm gonna stay and run a few extra tests on House's patient.
Masters : This one lab value doesn't make sense to me.
UNK: You're back with House? Mmm.
Masters : Just this one case. I'm not staying.
Cruz : I would kill for a chance to work with him,
Cruz : like, literally skin you and wear you as a disguise.
