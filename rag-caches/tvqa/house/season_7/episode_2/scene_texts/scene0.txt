Cuddy : Well, that's why I plan on doing some talking first.
Cuddy : I want us to formally report our relationship to Human Resources.
House : Okay. You get them, I'll cover everybody else.
Cuddy : I would appreciate it if we could keep it quiet until we had that meeting.
House : It's gonna be hard with me grabbing your ass all day.
Cuddy : Grabbing stops at the threshold.
Cuddy : Of the parking garage.
House : Handicapped plates. I get special access.
Cuddy : I just don't want our relationship affecting our jobs.
Cuddy : Or the other way around.
UNK: House loudly : Why, Dr. Cuddy, how was your weekend?
