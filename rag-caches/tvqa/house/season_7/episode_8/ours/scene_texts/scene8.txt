Ramon : You came from a wedding to tell me that?
UNK: No, I came from a wedding to run a PET scan.
Ramon : Thought you'd given up on me.
House : I have. PET scan was for your daughter.
House : I was wrong about her.
House : She did have glioblastoma.
House : And she still does. Cancer never went away.
Ramon : Yes, it did. They tested her every year.
Ramon : With a CT scan
House : which misses all the tiny little tumors that a PET scan doesn't.
UNK: You made a mistake. She does not have cancer anymore.
House : I ran it twice, no mistake.
House : Looks like God broke your deal.
Masters : I'm sorry.
House : But I'm also right.
Ramon : You're a bastard.
Ramon : Do whatever you want to me.
House : Good call.
Foreman : Surprised you've got enough strength to come to work today.
UNK: Thirty-six hours is long enough for me to recover.
