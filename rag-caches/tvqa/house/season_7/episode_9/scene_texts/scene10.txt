Chase : What did you do?
Taub : Our patient also developed a raging fever overnight.
Taub : That means Masters was right all along. This is an infection.
House : Should we give you a minute to gloat?
Masters : We still don't know what kind of infection.
UNK: It could be bacterial, viral, fungal. Until the cultures...
House : You are the worst gloater ever.
Foreman : Her starting those cultures when she did
Foreman : means we're 24 hours closer to the answer.
House : "We're sorry your husband croaked,
UNK: "but at least we were 24 hours closer to the answer."
House : Let's narrow it down, shall we?
Taub : Four days ago the guy was face-down in the subway.
Taub : God only knows what's in that sludge.
Taub : Toxic fumes make him pass out. Rat pee does the rest.
Chase : If it's leptospirosis, it's the fastest-moving case in history.
Foreman : Leptospirosis can turn into meningitis.
Masters : I can't confirm any of this yet.
Masters : We don't have time to choose wrong.
House : It fits,
House : and since it's the only idea on the table, I say it's a winner.
House : Start him on doxycycline. No, wait.
House : I'll do it.
Jack : You a doctor?
UNK: Sure.
House : You're on new meds. Go back to sleep.
Jack : Am I gonna die?
House : I hope not.
House : 'Cause then I'd have to go back to my office.
House : Of course, if you do kick it,
House : then you get to be famous for another two, maybe three weeks.
Jack : They're saying I'm a hero.
House : Yeah, but, you know, in a few days
House : a panda bear will give birth to triplets and we'll all move on.
House : Oh, I'm sorry. You actually believe that you are a hero.
UNK: You should get yourself some tights and a cape
UNK: and you can run around Gotham pulling babies out of burning buildings.
House : Maybe you'll keep getting lucky.
House : You're still the same guy you were last week.
Jack : Hey, how long are you gonna sit there?
House : Could be hours.
Jack : Hiding behind a sick guy, that's heroic.
