George : Thank you.
Molly : Yeah. OK.
George : Uh...
UNK: Uh, Molly, this is Dr... uh... This is Meredith.
UNK: She's going to be... continuing your prep work and taking your vitals. OK?
Derek : OK.
Meredith : - Hi. - Hey.
Meredith : - Uh, do you mind if I, um? - No, it's fine.
Molly : I'm getting used to being poked and prodded.
Meredith : That's, uh, a pretty ring.
Molly : Oh, thanks. It was my grandma's and then my mom's.
Molly : You think I'm too young to be married.
Cristina : - No, I... - That's OK.
Molly : Everybody thinks I'm too young. If I saw me, I'd think I was too young.
UNK: Um, how... how old are you?
Molly : 22. Eric's 23.
Molly : And he's in the army and he was getting shipped out.
UNK: And... I just love him so much, you know?
Molly : Anyway, I proposed.
Derek : Oh.
Meredith : And your, uh, parents? They approve?
Molly : Oh. Oh, my parents are amazing.
Molly : You know how dads can be. Mine's pretty overprotective.
UNK: But... you know, at my wedding, when he gave me away,
Molly : my dad cried, which was...
Molly : I had never seen my dad cry before.
Molly : But I think it was also kind of weird for him 'cause I'm his little girl.
Molly : I'm the youngest, and my sister's nowhere near ready for marriage.
UNK: But... it was good crying.
UNK: Like... he was proud of me, you know?
UNK: I'm sorry. I'm nervous, so I'm talking.
Meredith : - No, that's OK. So you have a sister? - Yeah. Lexie.
Molly : She's in medical school. Harvard. She's the smart one.
Molly : You should see how my dad is about her. He's like crazy proud.
Meredith : - Well, I'm going to go. - Meredith?
Meredith : - Hmm? - Do you think my baby's going to be OK?
Meredith : Oh. Well, I hope so.
Molly : Me too.
Derek : OK.
Meredith : - I need some bones to break. - What?
Meredith : Some bones to break. Something to smash. Can you help me with that?
UNK: Um... you can clean up this cast crap if you want.
Callie : - She freaking out? - No. Uh-uh. She's fine.
Derek : - Oh. - She's great.
Izzie : So, George... he's really, really your type, huh?
Callie : You don't see him.
Callie : Either of you. You don't see him. He's just...
Callie : He's just George to you. He's...
Callie : - He's just O'Malley. Your roommate. - You don't have to get all up...
