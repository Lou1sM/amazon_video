Derek : Uh, Dr. Bailey! You have an extra intern?
Bailey : - I'm available. - No, no, no, no. I said intern.
Bailey : - Shepherd, look at the board. - OK. What am I looking at?
UNK: My name isn't there. It wasn't there yesterday and it won't be tomorrow.
UNK: - Did you piss off the Chief? - Yeah.
Bailey : I went and had a baby. I gave birth. I created a human life. I'm a surgeon.
Bailey : We don't do that. He's mommy tracking me.
Derek : - He's just going easy on you. - No, I change diapers, I clean spit up,
UNK: I sing the ABCs. I'm covered in mommy. But I will not be mommy tracked!
Derek : - You're freaking out. - I just need a surgery. Now.
Bailey : So for today, I'm your intern.
Bailey : I have not begun to freak out.
Derek : All right. Come on.
Izzie : Cristina told me that George had a date with Ortho Chick.
Izzie : Games night. She didn't even take him home afterwards.
Izzie : She hinted that she wanted to and then said she couldn't. Weird, right?
Meredith : George made it perfectly clear that I'm not in his life anymore.
Izzie : Think Ortho Chick is hiding something?
Callie : Stevens. Hold this.
Callie : George mentioned you're not big on ortho.
Callie : Grey? Take the osteotome and the mallet.
Callie : Follow me.
Alex : Ms. Carver, unfortunately, we found that the cancer
Alex : has metastasized to your chest wall.
Alex : We took out a small tumor obstructing your airway
Alex : which will help with your breathing, but... it's not a cure.
Beatrice : So this is the end of the line. That's what you're saying? I die now?
Burke : - Beatrice... - I want you to go back in
Beatrice : and I want you to cut out everything that you can. As much as you can.
Beatrice : I want as much time as you can give me, you understand?
UNK: Unfortunately, additional surgery...
George : Excuse me.
Daughter : Mom, I'm not eating any of that crap in the cafeteria.
UNK: We'll have to order in Thai food or something
Daughter : because I'm starving and the food here blows.
Beatrice : I'll have the nurse bring a menu by and we can have a picnic in bed.
UNK: - God, how many doctors do you have? - They were just leaving.
UNK: After trailing by ten at the half, the offense stepped up.
UNK: Leading a 13 and 0 run to begin a seesaw battle right up to the end.
Teacher : In five to ten years, cutting, as we know it, will be virtually obsolete.
Teacher : - Very nice, Dr. Yang. - Thank you, sir.
Teacher : A little less tension there, Chief. Watch your grip. There you go.
Richard : - I wasn't copying you. - Of course not, sir.
Cristina : Done! I'm done!
Cristina : I totally finished first. I'm done.
Izzie : - So, Dr. Torres... - Hold it steady, Grey.
UNK: Did you always want to specialize in orthopedics?
