UNK: Definitely excise the endobronchial mets for symptomatic palliation.
Burke : You've been doing your homework, Karev.
Alex : Lot of late nights.
Burke : Look at this. The mets have adhered to her chest wall.

Burke : Bedside manner is part of the job, Karev.
Burke : Late nights won't get you anywhere. You have to figure that out.
