Izzie : That is not a name. Callie.
Izzie : Who is she anyway? I'm his best friend.
Izzie : - Not that he talks to me anymore. - Triple word score. 69 points.
Denny : Woman, I'm beating the pants off you.
UNK: - Pay attention. What are you doing? - I'm knitting a sweater.
UNK: Actually, Meredith, my friend that broke George, she is knitting the sweater.
Izzie : She's not really knitting the sweater because she cannot knit,
Izzie : but I want her to think she is because we took a celibacy vow,
UNK: so she's replacing sex with knitting, so I'm knitting some of Meredith's sweater
Izzie : so I can switch them out with hers so she can really believe she's knitting
Izzie : because if anybody needs to be celibate, it's Meredith,
Izzie : because she broke George. You know?
Denny : - You took a vow of celibacy? - Yes.
Denny : How am I supposed to get in your pants if you're celibate?
UNK: That's inappropriate to say to your doctor.
Denny : You know what's inappropriate?
Denny : Promising sexual favors to a patient to get him to live and then backing out.
Izzie : Denny Duquette! I so never ever promised...
Denny : In my head, you did. In my head, you delivered.
Meredith : Well...
Denny : Don't worry.
Denny : You weren't very good.
Izzie : OK. You know what? I was being nice.
Izzie : I was letting you win. Because you're "Mr. Sick Needs A New Organ Guy. "
Izzie : But just for that comment, I'm going to kick your ass.
Izzie : Yeah, I'm going to... You put down "mount," Denny?
UNK: There are those of us who love to play games. Any game.
UNK: And there are those of us who love to play... a little too much.
George : OK, uh, disastrous FEMA director.
Derek : - No. - Oh, uh. Oh.
George : - Poo is? - Brown. Poo is brown! Michael Brown!
George : - Yes! - Time! Time!
UNK: George and Callie : Whoo!
George : Yeah, thank you.
Burke : - Impressive, O'Malley. - Thanks.
Burke : "Poo is"?
Callie : - Apparently, we think alike. - Can't believe you're proud of that.
Callie : Are you supposed to open that ahead of time?
George : - Hey! - It's called strategy.
Burke : - Cristina, it's a game. - I know that.
UNK: You seem a little intense and we're having fun.
UNK: I'm having fun. Let's do this.
Derek : - OK. - Are you ready?
Cristina : - Mm-hmm. - Go!
Cristina : Blond Ambition tour.
UNK: - Blond Ambition tour! - Oh.
UNK: Vogue!
Cristina : Oh, are you kidding? OK, she's blonde! She's ambitious!
UNK: With the... She's ambitious! And with the tour! And the vogueing!
Cristina : Honey, OK, look at me!
UNK: OK... Shut up! Cones! Cones!
Cristina : Blond ambition, boob cones, and, uh, vogueing, honey, vogueing.
Cristina : Sean Penn! Sean Penn!
Cristina : Time!
George : Zero points for Madonna.
Burke : Oh! Madonna. Right.
Cristina : Who doesn't know Madonna?
Izzie : - Sore loser. - I am not a sore loser.
UNK: And so what if I am? The point of games is that there's a winner. A first place.
UNK: You want a second-best surgeon operating on you?
Cristina : No, you want the very best. And second best is mediocre.
Cristina : And to settle for mediocrity is... is frankly, you know,
Cristina : a sign of self-loathing and substandard work ethics.
UNK: I've got to get George out of my apartment.
Meredith : You could sleep with him and right in the middle start crying.
Meredith : It's painful and humiliating and unbelievably cruel,
Meredith : but apparently it works.
Izzie : Would you just keep knitting? Kick him out so that he can come back home to us.
Cristina : No, I can't kick him out. You know, he's Burke's puppy.
UNK: It's got to be Burke's idea. I just got to figure out a way to make him do it.
