Daughter : Mom, I'm not getting married any time soon.
Beatrice : You will someday.
Beatrice : And when that day comes,

Beatrice : because there's nothing tackier than a drunken bride.
Amelia : Mom, I don't want to...

Beatrice : Amelia. Listen to me.
Beatrice : Look at me. Amelia.
Beatrice : This is important.
Beatrice : This one is... is really the important one.
Beatrice : Someday you're going to have a baby.
Beatrice : And you're going to feel overwhelmed by this little life you're responsible for.
Beatrice : And you're going to think... worry everything you do is wrong.
Beatrice : And that's normal.
Beatrice : You're going to obsess about what to feed it
Beatrice : and where to send it to school
Beatrice : and whether it should take violin or piano.
UNK: But I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
Beatrice : It doesn't matter.
Beatrice : Whether your kid is a concert pianist or a math genius, it just doesn't matter
Beatrice : because at the end of the day, all that matters is if your kid is happy.
Beatrice : So you're going to feel sad... for a little while.
UNK: And that's OK. That's... That's fine.
Beatrice : But don't feel sad forever. OK?
Beatrice : You can promise me that? You promise me that you won't feel sad for too long?
Beatrice : - I promise. - OK. Thank you.
Beatrice : You make me feel much better.

Izzie : Ta-dah!
Denny : You made me a sweater.
Denny : Today. In one day, you made me a sweater?
Izzie : Yeah, well, you know. I just had some time, so...
Denny : That vow of celibacy must really be something.
Izzie : You know what? Just accept your gift and say thank you.
Denny : Does this mean I don't get any sexual favors?
UNK: Sweater instead of sex?
Izzie : Smell it. Go on, smell it.
Denny : It smells like Izzie.
Izzie : Yeah, I wore it for three hours.
Izzie : So that is the closest you're going to be getting to this body, mister.
UNK: You want to play some Scrabble or you too tired?
Denny : Scrabble, please.

Richard : Old school, Yang.
Richard : Muscle memory.
Richard : You want to win, always go back to the basics.
Burke : It's my move?
Burke : Cristina, what the hell are you doing?
Derek : Oh. Um... being comfortable in my apartment.
George : I didn't see anything! Dude, I did not see anything!
Thatcher : Get out.
Richard : Basics.
UNK: So go ahead :
UNK: Argue with the refs, change the rules...

Izzie : Not really.
Lola : You give up men?
Derek : No.
Izzie : Yes.
Meredith : I don't actually need to see the vet.
Meredith : I really just wanted to sit with Doc. I just want to spend time with my dog.
Finn : Hi. I'm Finn Dandridge. I'm Doc's vet.
Finn : And you are Dr. Grey. Doc's other owner.
Finn : We finally meet.
Addison : Hello.
