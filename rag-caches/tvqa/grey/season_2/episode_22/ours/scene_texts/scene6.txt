UNK: Did you always want to model?
Izzie : Oh. OK.
Callie : Grey, I mean it. Watch your grip.
Izzie : And your husband? Is he a doctor too?
Callie : What are you trying to ask me, Dr. Stevens?
Callie : My history? My marital status? My deep dark little secrets?
Izzie : - I'm George's best friend. - Oh, I see.
Callie : Well, it's just funny because from what I understand,
Callie : as his best friend, you haven't been the best matchmaker in the past.
Meredith : - Hi. - Hey.
Izzie : Your hair's growing. I still think you should cut it.
Izzie : I could cut it for you, if we still lived together.
Izzie : Or we could just hang out and talk, about stuff.
Izzie : Like your new friend. Callie.
Izzie : She's, uh, she's very, um...
Izzie : You know, if you like her, I will like her. Eventually.
George : - I can't escape her. - What?
George : All I want to do is forget her. All I want to do is just escape her and...
George : you know, I can't.
Izzie : You want to escape Callie?
Izzie : Thank God, because she is like a total freak
Izzie : and I'm starting to get really worried about you.
Izzie : Not Callie.
Izzie : Sorry. Oops.
UNK: Who? Or, uh... Oh! Meredith again.
George : Let me tell you something.
UNK: The minute I tell you this, it officially becomes your problem.
George : - Not mine. - OK.
George : Meredith has a sister.
Derek : - How we doing? - Turning the skull flap.
Doctor : - Patient's sedated. - Very nice. Nicely done.
Bailey : - He's a kid. - Yes.
Bailey : I just didn't think it would be a kid. A tumor that size...
Bailey : - What happens now? - Now we wake him up.
UNK: - We're doing awake brain surgery? - Yes. Thank you.
Derek : Andrew?
Derek : A little more. Andrew?
Derek : Can you hear me?
Derek : Hey. Want to count for me?
Meredith : - One... - Good. Keep going.
Andrew : Two.
Andrew : Three.
Derek : The tumor is located near the language center of the brain.
Derek : It's always important that we don't damage it.
Derek : Andrew? I need you to keep talking. Can you do that? Can you talk to me?
UNK: I'II... I'll try.
Derek : - Great. Now what grade are you in? - Um... seventh.
Derek : You into sports?
Izzie : - Not really. - How about baseball?
UNK: Um... baseball's a sport.
Derek : Right. OK. What about, uh, girls? Do you have any girlfriends?
Derek : No.
UNK: Um... you probably don't have time for girlfriends, right, Andrew?
Bailey : - Probably too busy, right? - Yes, ma'am.
Bailey : What are you busy doing?
Andrew : Getting ready for the National Spelling Bee.
Andrew : I won the greater regionals last month.
Bailey : Oh, well, in that case, you need to spell some words for us.
Bailey : - Uh, can you do that? - Sure.
Bailey : Good. Uh...
Derek : You usually provide the word, Dr. Bailey.
Bailey : I don't hear you coming up with one.
UNK: Uh, let's see. Oh, right! Um, "acetaminophen. "
Bailey : Acetaminophen.
Andrew : Origin of the word?
Bailey : Heck if I know.
Addison : - Do you have Molly's MRI results? - No. I haven't. Not yet.
UNK: - What the hell have you been doing? - I was just going...
Addison : When I assign you to a case of mine
Addison : I expect you to give it your full and undivided attention.
Addison : Give me one good reason why I shouldn't take you off this case.
George : Molly Thompson's maiden name is Grey.
George : Her father is Thatcher Grey, who is Meredith's father,
UNK: so Molly and Meredith are sisters, but I don't think Meredith knows Molly exists.
George : That... I don't care.
George : I don't, except I'm on this case and apparently God hates me.
Derek : - OK. - OK. Thanks.
