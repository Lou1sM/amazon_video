UNK: A good basketball game can have us all on the edge of our seats.
UNK: Games are all about the glory, the pain and the play-by-play.
UNK: And then there are the more solitary games.
UNK: Joe To Derek : Dude, is she knitting?
UNK: The games we each play all by ourselves.
Derek : You know, as a friend, I got to tell you, you look a little weird.
Meredith : I am making a sweater.
Joe : You're knitting. In a bar. You're scaring the customers.
Derek : - Come on, have a drink. - I can't have a drink. I'm celibate.
Joe : You mean sober? She means sober.
Meredith : No. Celibate.
Meredith : I'm practicing celibacy, and drinking does not go well with celibacy
Meredith : because it makes everything and everyone seem kind of porny.
Meredith : Then my head gets all cloudy and the next thing, I'm naked.
Meredith : And my point is, I'm celibate, and knitting is good for surgical dexterity,
Meredith : so I'm making a sweater.
Derek : You, celibate?
Derek : - I just don't buy it. - No more men.
Addison : No more men? Really? You?
Addison : And I'm asking because we are friends.
Meredith : Every guy I meet turns out to be married.
Derek : - Ooh. Ouch. - Sorry. Or Mark.
UNK: - OK, I'm going to go over there now. - Sorry.
Meredith : Or remember the horrible thing I did? Remember George?
Derek : - You're making a sweater. - I am making a sweater.
UNK: The social games, the mind games, we use them to pass the time.
UNK: To make life more interesting.
UNK: To distract us from what's really going on.
Izzie : He's just not George anymore. He's broken George.
Izzie : First he chops off his hair. Then he starts hanging out with this Callie.
