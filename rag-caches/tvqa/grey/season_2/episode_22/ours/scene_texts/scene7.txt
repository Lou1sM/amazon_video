Beatrice : I want all this out now. I'm getting out of the hospital.
Burke : - Oh, we can't, Beatrice. - Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday.
Beatrice : Apparently, it's the last one I get to celebrate. I'm not spending it here.
Burke : OK, I'm so sorry. But if we remove this tube, your lung will collapse.
UNK: You don't want to spend her birthday this way.
Beatrice : I'm a quick healer. I'm breathing better.
UNK: The removal of some of the tumor opened up your airway.
Burke : That doesn't mean that you are well.
Burke : You're at risk of infection or hemorrhage.
Alex : Your kid doesn't even know you have cancer.
Alex : You really want to risk dropping dead on the street outside the hospital?
Burke : Dr. Karev.
UNK: So you thought... scaring her back in the bed was the way to go?
Alex : It worked, didn't it? She's lying to her kid.
Burke : She's frightened. She's in shock.
Burke : It is not your job or your place to take a tone like that with a patient.
Burke : Not ever. Are we understood?
Alex : Yes, sir.
Izzie : So what are the sister and the father like?
Cristina : Like? They're like people Meredith is related to and never met.
George : - They're nice. - Can you imagine?
Izzie : A sister, a whole family you know nothing about.
Izzie : - You think she's going to freak out? - It's not my responsibility to care.
Cristina : Heads up. Heads up.
George : Hey, Chief.
George : Seems I'm a little rusty on my bead transfer and rope pass.
George : Dr. Yang here, has been kicking my ass all day.
Izzie : - Oh, I can't imagine, Chief. - No, really, she has.
UNK: Of course, speed and precision
Richard : aren't the most important surgical skills, Dr. Yang.
Richard : The basics are the key. You need a solid foundation before anything else.
Richard : OK, um... Well, I'll see you back at the lab.
Richard : - Enjoy your lunch. - You too.
Izzie : Have a nice day, sir.
Cristina : OK, I really am kicking the Chief's ass.
Meredith : - George. - Not my responsibility.
George : - See you guys. - So who's going to be the...
Meredith : It's OK. I can accept rejection. I've got my knitting.
