Joe : - You called the gurney patrol? - Sit back and relax.
UNK: - The hospital will run some tests... - Tests? I don't need tests. I'm fine!
UNK: You collapsed! On the floor. It's your bar. You know how filthy this floor is.
Meredith : - Pulse is strong. - Minor skull contusions.
Meredith : - You're sleeping with someone? - What?
UNK: - Even George got some action. - Correction. George got some syphilis.
UNK: - How could I not know? - Forget this.
Joe : The hospital is right across the street.
Joe : I can sure as hell walk across the street by myself.
Cristina : - I think we should... - No, I got him. Joe!
Meredith : All right.
Meredith : Details. You're pregnant?
Meredith : What are you gonna do?
Cristina : Look, you know what happens to pregnant interns.
UNK: I'm not switching to the vagina squad or spending my life popping zits.
Cristina : I'm too talented. Surgery's my life.
UNK: Which begs the question : Who are you sleeping with?
Cristina : - Just a guy. - That's all I get?
Meredith : You can't just bring something like this up and expect me to drop it.
Cristina : Well, watch me.
Izzie : Don't you have a date with McDreamy?
George : - More like McMarried. - McWhat?
Meredith : I came to check on Joe.
George : - You think he's gonna be OK? - Will he need an operation?
Derek : Operation, yes. OK, hard to tell.
UNK: Basilar artery's like a balloon. Subarachnoid bleeding.
Derek : - Aneurysm the size of a golf ball. - No way to clip something like that.
Cristina : - Not without magic fingers. - Or a standstill operation.
Cristina : You're doing a standstill... He's doing a standstill operation.
Derek : I'd like to try. First I need some additional patient history,
Derek : overnight labs, and a cerebral angio.
Meredith : - I'm drunk. - Meredith...
Izzie : McBastard.
Izzie : Ahem.
George : - What are you doing? - Uh...
Cristina : I am on her side. But we're talking a possible standstill here.
Cristina : Recognize.
Derek : - Meredith! - Go away!
Derek : Just wait. We should discuss this.
Meredith : Here's a thought. No! Quit following me!
Derek : - At least let me explain. - Explain?
Meredith : You should have explained the night we met in the bar.
Meredith : Before any of the rest of it.
Meredith : - That would have been a good time. - Look, I know how you feel.
Meredith : Do you? Somehow I doubt that.
Meredith : Because if you did, you would shut up,
Meredith : and you would turn around and go back inside,
Meredith : because you would realize that I am this close to getting in my car
Meredith : and running you down in the parking lot!
UNK: - Where're your keys? - I'm fine!
George : Meredith, give me your keys.
George : Let's go home.
UNK: ...and the husband was the...
Addison : Well, I will be back in the morning to report for duty.
UNK: And you... get some rest.
Derek : What is she doing here?
Richard : You and I both know she's the best in the field.
UNK: Bringing Addie out was a business decision, nothing personal.
Derek : Oh, well, what a relief.
Derek : It's not personal. It is personal to me.
UNK: The workings of my surgical unit don't have any...
Derek : - Don't include my wife! - Don't include your private life!
