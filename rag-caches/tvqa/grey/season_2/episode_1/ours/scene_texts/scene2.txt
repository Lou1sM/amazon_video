Derek : Burke. You gave Grey to Addison. Are you sure about that?
UNK: That's not your call, Shepherd. And for the record, I'm always sure.
UNK: Did you need me? As the new chief, I'm...
Derek : - Interim chief. - "Chief" nonetheless.
Derek : Ever attempt a standstill surgery?
Derek : It's the location of the aneurysm that makes it tricky.
Burke : Your body temperature would be lowered to protect it and stop the heart.
Derek : Which stops blood flow to the brain which reduces the risk of rupture.
Derek : I'll have 45 minutes to clip the aneurysm.
UNK: - Before I get the heart started again. - You wanna freeze my body,
Joe : - drain my blood, and stop my heart? - And bring you back.
Joe : - In under 45 minutes? - Right.
Joe : - If you go over, is it free? - No.

UNK: Don't worry about that right now.
Joe : Look, you guys say that you can kill me and bring me back, I believe you.
Joe : You're doctors, but I own a bar.
Joe : I don't got any insurance so I'm not that concerned about the surgery
UNK: so much as what I'm gonna do when I survive it.
Joe : I need a number. Ten grand? Twenty?
Joe : - Thirty? - It's a couple hundred at least.
Derek : At least.
