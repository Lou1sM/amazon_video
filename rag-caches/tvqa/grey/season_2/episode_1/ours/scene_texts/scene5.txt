Cristina : Just so we're clear,
Cristina : do not breathe a word of what you heard last night to anyone.
Cristina : Not about me. Not about Meredith. Not about Meredith and Dr. McDreamy...
Joe : - Hey, Dr. Burke. - Joe.
Cristina : Um, vital signs stable overnight. Today's CT shows no re-bleeding.
Cristina : The EKG...
Cristina : shows...
Cristina : um, normal sinus rhythm.
Cristina : No ischemia, no dysrhythmias.
Burke : Looking good. Page me if there are any changes.
George : Oh, hi, Chief.
George : No, not much going on.
George : Other than your interim chief making out with my friend in the stairwell,
UNK: but, hey... Sponge duty sucks.
UNK: - You talking to yourself now? - Yes. No!
George : Damn it, I'm a bad sponge. A leaky sponge.
George : I'm gonna leak all the wrong secrets.
George : I'm a bad liar, can't even lie about talking to myself.
George : You look nice today.
Meredith : Wore my new lip gloss
UNK: 'cause my ex-boyfriend's wife looks like Isabella freakin' Rossellini,
UNK: and I'm like... me.
Meredith : I'm trying to outdo her when she's the victim here. How crazy is that?
George : Not crazy. Smart.
George : You know, gloss, you know, prevents chapped lips and... you...
George : Ex-boyfriend?
Meredith : I'm an evil mistress.
George : Well, still. You look nice.
Meredith : Thanks. What are you doing here?
Meredith : Come on, O'Malley. Out with it.
George : OK. Can you think of any reason, any reason at all, really,
George : why Cristina would be kissing Burke?
Meredith : After all this time. All your warnings about me sleeping with my boss,
UNK: - and you're doing the same thing? - It's not the same.
UNK: - It's the same... - You two are in a relationship.
Meredith : And you and Burke are in?
Cristina : Switzerland. It's very neutral there. And they make very nice watches.
Meredith : Have you even bothered to tell Burke about the baby?
Meredith : - Are you going to? - Look, Meredith, can we not go there?
UNK: Can everyone just accept that I like to keep some things to myself?
Cristina : - I don't discuss everything to death. - Well, why even confide in me at all
Meredith : if you're so intent on not discussing it?
Meredith : Why even tell me?
Julie : When I found out about the miniskirt, I called her up and took her to lunch.
Julie : It was perfectly civil. I said I didn't hold it against her,
Julie : that these things happened. But, really?
UNK: I wanted to put a face on the bitch
Julie : that got my husband to throw away 15 years of marriage.
Burke : - Got a second? - Depends on what you need.
Burke : Who the hell is Dr. McDreamy?
Bailey : Me. I'm Dr. McDreamy.
Bailey : I'm tall, handsome.
UNK: I lean against things and ponder the difficulties of dating beautiful women.
Bailey : I'm trying to be a surgeon here!
Derek : - That took a lot of nerve. - She came highly recommended.
Addison : - Right. - So you don't recommend her?
Derek : - I did not say that. - Just not her medical skills.
Meredith : - Dr. Shepherd. - Yes?
Meredith : Labs confirm what look like abnormalities on the ultrasound.
Meredith : - I think you should come and see. - Fine. Let's go.
Derek : - Meredith. Meredith... - Don't.
UNK: Any available IV nurse to OR Two. Any available IV nurse to OR Two.
