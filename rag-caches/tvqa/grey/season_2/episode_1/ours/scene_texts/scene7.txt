UNK: OK, let's get going!
Addison : Ten blade. Begin with a three-millimeter incision.
Burke : - We stop the blood flow? - To protect the brain.
Cristina : Operate in a bloodless field so the aneurysm won't rupture.
Burke : - And cool the body? - To induce hypothermia.
Cristina : Keeps the tissue viable until the blood is restored.
Doctor : Body temp is at 60 degrees.
Burke : OK, Joe. Time to die.
Doctor : Flatline.
Derek : - We've got 45 minutes, people. - Start the clock.
Doctor : Got it.
Derek : So what's your "Joe" story? Seems like everybody here has one.
Burke : You first.
Derek : OK. I went to Joe's place the night before I started working here.
Derek : I'd only been in town, you know, a few days.
UNK: I met a woman. I got drunk and she took advantage of me.
Derek : Or she got drunk and I took advantage of her.
Derek : I got drunk and she took... No. We were drunk. Definitely.
Derek : Somebody took advantage. Either way, I look at it as my initiation to Seattle.
Derek : - What about you? - Oh, I don't have one.
Burke : I just wanted to hear yours.
George : So, technically, the paperwork just needs to be submitted
George : by midnight of the day of the surgery to be considered?
Richard : Oh, good. Well, thank you very much. Thanks.
Addison : How you doing there, Grey?
Meredith : Good. I'm good.
Alex : You know, I'm very sweet once you get to know me.
Izzie : - No, you're not. - We could be good friends.
Izzie : - Alex. Never, ever. Ever. - Why not?
Izzie : Give me one reason why we could? What about you is even remotely human?
Alex : It's going too slowly.
Izzie : - I hope Joe can pull through this. - He can. He will. He has to.
UNK: Damn it. I can't get the clamp to hold.
Derek : Give me the bipolars. I'm gonna go in at a different angle.
Burke : Time remaining?
Derek : - Irrigation, please. - 17 minutes.
UNK: Shepherd, I need eight minutes to get him back, to warm him up.
Derek : Time to make the next 17 minutes count.
Derek : Right there, go in from there. See it?
Derek : See, that's why we can't do it right there.
George : He's dead. Technically.
George : Which is science, and this is a huge thing.
UNK: So some research foundation has to be interested.
