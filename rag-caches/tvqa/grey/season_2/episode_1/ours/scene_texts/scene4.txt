Richard : What's the report?
George : No report. It's very quiet today, sir.
UNK: There's no gossip? Surgeries I should know about?
UNK: - Now come on, what's the buzz? - You know, not in halls, not in OR.
George : Not in the stairwells.
George : Especially nothing happening in the, you know... They're just stairwells.
Alex : They told me you were in a nightgown, but I thought I'd come see.
Alex : Very nice, huh.
Joe : Heard O'Malley laid you out cold. Nice eye.
Joe : - Whoa, who sent that? - We all pitched in. The whole floor.
Joe : Well, please, tell the whole floor a big thank you.
Nurse : Yeah, I will.
Joe : Alex, you gotta get me out of here, man. Get me transferred to County Hospital.
UNK: Not County. Here, they can kill you and bring you back,
Alex : but at County, they can just kill you. No joke.
Joe : I can't afford this place, man. I'm gonna lose the bar.
Man : - Hey, Joe, how you doing? - Hey, Scooter.
UNK: OK. That's mine?
UNK: - We'll start by saving your life. - The bar is my life. You know that.
Joe : You've been at last call every night since you moved here.
Joe : I'm gonna have to shut it down or sell it.
Alex : You can't do that. Place is an institution.
Joe : I've owned the bar across the street for 14 years,
Joe : and I've never been inside this hospital till now.
UNK: I'll pay my tab. That's gotta be good for something. How much is it?
Joe : Close to a grand.
Alex : How about I pay, like, 60?
Alex : That's good. And I'll pay you back later.
Joe : Hey, champ!
UNK: Orderly, please report to station three. Orderly, report to station three.
Julie : What does it take to go after another woman's husband?
Meredith : - Excuse me? - It happened to me.
Julie : Jeff moved in with a long-legged miniskirt who answers his phones
Julie : three weeks into my pregnancy. That gel is really cold.
Meredith : I'm sorry. I'm sorry about your husband.
Julie : Are you sorry about Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd's husband?
Meredith : I'm going to be checking a few things today.
Julie : I bet she asked to work with you. It's what I would have done.
Meredith : I'm gonna go check on your labs.
Joe : Heya, sunshine.
Cristina : Deep breath.
Joe : Morning sickness must suck.
