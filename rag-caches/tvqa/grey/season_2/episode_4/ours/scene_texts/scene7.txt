George : You are the crazy woman on four.
UNK: I made a break for freedom. Hand me that dictionary.
George : You have a better patient than me and you don't even have a patient.
George : Meredith's got a CF case. Alex's got the gunshot wound.
George : Izzie's got the mystery arrhythmias. I'm not a nanny.
UNK: I am a surgeon. A cutter.
UNK: But no, I'm getting fake labs for a fake patient so she can do a fake surgery.
UNK: Cristina to herself : - She's faking it. - It's real to her. It's Alzheimer's.
Cristina : The missionary. Kalpana...
UNK: God! Thank you!
Cristina : Ow!
UNK: Uncalled for!
Cristina : - Izzie. How have her studies been? - I've been looking for that everywhere.
UNK: Cristina continues : Negative, right?
UNK: Oh! The echo test showed mild mitral stenosis, the tilt test was negative.
Izzie : We're doing EP studies.
UNK: I know what's wrong without sticking electrodes in her heart.
UNK: Izzie disbelieving : - Really. Just by the chart? - No, from the pill she took.
UNK: They were contraceptives. Why are you so obsessed with this? Just go back to bed.
Cristina : - She's doing this to herself. - Inducing ventricular arrhythmias?
UNK: Izzie disbelieving : - She'd have to be crazy. - No, she'd have to have Munchausen's.
Izzie : Wait. You think she's secretly ingesting something to produce real symptoms?
Izzie : - Seriously? - Yep. Just run it by Burke.
Cristina : - Tell me what he thinks. - Tell him yourself. He's behind you.
Derek : - Where are we? - OR Two in 30 minutes.
UNK: He's prepped, transpo's on the way.
UNK: Mrs. Linden : Do you understand that? 21 years!
Derek : - What's that all about? - I haven't got a clue.
Samuel : I love you. I forgive you.
UNK: You cheated on me. You cheated on me.
UNK: Mrs. Linden : - You do not get to play the martyr. - I got a bullet in my head.
UNK: Mrs. Linden : - And that doesn't make us even. - You shot me!
Derek : I think we need to get the police up here right now.
Cristina : She obviously loves the patient role. She practically lives in hospitals.
Cristina : And we're like an imaginary family to her
UNK: because her real family blows her off to go take care of other people.
Cristina : - And I saw her take something. - That's not enough.
Burke : We have to rule out everything else.
UNK: She lied about her job. She's a pharmacy tech, not a Ph. D.
Burke : So she's a liar. I've been lied to before.
Cristina : - We're not talking about us here. - Maybe we should be.
Cristina : - I didn't lie. - You withheld the truth.
UNK: OK, you know what? I remember you breaking things off with me.
UNK: Cristina interrupts : You didn't seem so upset about it. This? This is not a relationship.
UNK: Cristina interrupts : - This is not real. - Cristina!
UNK: OK, and so what's with the big fake display of hurt and drama?
Helen : - Cristina! - I'm supposed to be in bed.
Helen : Cristina!
Derek : Officers, thanks for coming.
Officer : Ma'am, why don't you have a seat? We need to ask you a few questions.
UNK: Uh, of course.
Addison : Well, nothing like a domestic dispute to liven up a pre-op, huh?
Jeremiah : - Where do I sign? - Here, for consent.
Bailey : And here for DNR and no extraordinary measures.
Bailey : Good. OK, lift up for me.
