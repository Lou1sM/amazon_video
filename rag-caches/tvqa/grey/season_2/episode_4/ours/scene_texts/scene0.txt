Cristina : It's my chart.
Burke : You're the patient. Not the doctor. Act like one.
Burke : - It's been tough finding you alone. - Yeah? Well...
Burke : - How are you doing? - You have my chart. You tell me.
Burke : How are you doing?
Cristina : I'm fine. Perfectly OK.
Burke : - I had a right to know. - Well, now you do.
George : - Cristina... - Look. Now you know. It's over.
Cristina : There's nothing for you to deal with. So what else is there left to say?
Burke : - Plenty. For starters... - Oh, look. It's my mother.
Burke : Dr. Preston Burke. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Yang.
Helen : Actually it's Rubenstein.
UNK: Dr. Saul Rubenstein of Beverly Hills? The oral surgeon?
Helen : I'm remarried. Been remarried since Cristina was, what? About three?
UNK: Mom, that's too much information, he has other things to do.
UNK: You're good-Iooking. He's good-Iooking.
Helen : Why don't you ever bring home a man as good-Iooking as him?
Meredith : - Stop. - What?
UNK: Cristina quiet : - Stop talking. - Cristina. Forgive her.
Helen : I don't know what I ever did to raise such an unpleasant girl.
UNK: Cristina now loud : - Oh, me? I'm unpleasant? - Excuse me.
Cristina : - Do you know who that was? - Who?
Cristina : - That was my boss! - I only said nice things.
UNK: Why'd you call me unpleasant in front of my boss?
Helen : Lighten up, please.
UNK: OK, I was thinking that maybe we might want to... you might...
Izzie : - OK, we both have tonight off so... - You are so into me.
Bailey : - Shut up. - It's sad. The worship. The adoration.
UNK: And I'm so handsome, I intoxicate you.
Izzie : OK, you know what? Forget it.
Alex : Izzie, would you like to go out with me tonight?
UNK: On a date? And you wear something gorgeous, I pay for food...
Izzie : - Are you making fun of me? - I'm not making fun of you.
Izzie : OK, then.
Woman : - Good. - Good.
UNK: I said I never wanted to see you again.
UNK: 'Cause you're too lazy to learn anything more.
UNK: Bailey huffs : Dr. Meredith Grey, Jeremiah Tate.
UNK: Bailey huffs : Thinks he knows so much because he was my first intern patient.
UNK: I knew as much as her. She was clueless about how to treat cystic fibrosis.
UNK: A cholecystectomy turned into a month-Iong stay.
Bailey : Better not be alleging malpractice.
UNK: Guy raises about 100,000 grand a year for cystic fibrosis, running triathlons.
Bailey : - Thinks he's a big shot. - You run triathlons?
Jeremiah : - Why not? - Pain for one.
Bailey : - Finally admitting to feeling a little? - A little.
Bailey : How little? Truth.
Jeremiah : Enough to keep me awake at night.
Jeremiah : Had some seizures. Too weak to work out.
Bailey : Anyone been through here with your CT results?
Jeremiah : No. It's probably just my pancreatitis kicking up again.
Bailey : All right then. We'll be back.
Bailey : With your results and a plan.
Bailey : Where do your parents think you are this time?
UNK: Jeremiah he smiles : New Jersey.
Meredith : What about his parents?
Bailey : He doesn't like to bother them until he's well or about to get discharged.
Bailey : He understands his reality. He just chooses to ignore it.
