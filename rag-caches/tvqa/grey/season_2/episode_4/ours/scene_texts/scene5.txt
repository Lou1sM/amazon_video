Burke : - So? - That's what I said.
Kalpana : That other doctor made such a big deal of it.
Izzie : She didn't tell us before. So I documented it in her med list.
Burke : - What other doctor? - Cristina. She was wandering the halls.

Kalpana : Won't I need a pacemaker or a permanent internal defibrillator?
Burke : Although it would be unusual for rheumatic heart disease
