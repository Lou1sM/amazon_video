UNK: You're walking, you're talking, there's no exit wound.
Alex : - This mark here looks more like a burn. - I'm telling you, I shot myself.
UNK: Pulled the trigger cleaning my.22. I thought the clip was out.
Man : If you're thinking suicide, don't.
Man : People make mistakes. I made a mistake.
Man : And now I'm paying for it. But I did shoot myself.
Tyler : - Where's your IV? - I'm taking solids. I Hep-Locked it.
Tyler : - On whose orders? - Mine.
UNK: OK. Yang.
UNK: How about this order : "Bed rest, out of bed to chair, bathroom privileges."
UNK: Nothing about stealing charts.
Izzie : OK, you know what. Hey. Give me that.
Cristina : There. Satisfied? I'm "out of bed to chair."
Tyler : - I'm telling your intern on you. - Meredith?
Cristina : - Yep. - Oh, I'm so scared.
George : - Dr. Grey, how are you doing? - You're here. Good.
Ellis : I need the results of the barium esophagram or the EGD.
Ellis : And you have neither. OK, no worries. I'll be here when you get back.
Richard : So today you're her intern. Well, that's better than being her husband.
George : - That's a matter of opinion. - Good morning, Ellis.
Ellis : Richard, good to see you. I need those labs immediately.
UNK: George softly : Chief? She's not a surgical patient anymore.
UNK: George softly : And I'd really like to get back to the OR.
UNK: So, do you think I could hand her off to someone else?
UNK: Richard softly : O'Malley, Alzheimer's causes her reality to shift depending on situation or mood.
UNK: Richard softly : She needs stability right now.
UNK: Richard softly : That's why I'm depending on you to keep a special eye on her.
UNK: Yes, I know, sir.
George : But, you know, it just doesn't seem fair to me.
Ellis : I need those studies yesterday.
Richard : You heard the doctor.
Richard : Get moving.
UNK: I saw that. I saw you take that pill.
UNK: Oh, it's my pill. You know, the pill.
UNK: It's not in your chart. You're supposed to tell us all the meds you're on.
Kalpana : You're not my doctor. You shouldn't even be here.
Izzie : - She's right. You shouldn't be here. - She took unauthorized medication.
Kalpana : I'm on the pill and I had grapefruit juice this morning.
Kalpana : Since the juice inhibits enzymes involved in the metabolism of OCPs,
UNK: I avoided the interaction by taking it two hours after food.
UNK: She has a doctorate in neuropharmacology.
UNK: - I don't see oral contraceptives. - Guys.
UNK: Now you will. Go back to bed and stop poaching my patients?
UNK: This is ridiculous! Go back to bed and stop poaching my patients!
UNK: - She's in V-fib! - Call the code!
UNK: Code blue, second floor.
UNK: Code blue, second floor.
UNK: - You got the code equipment? - It's all ready to go.
Nurse : - No code? - Not anymore.
UNK: - Can you help us get her back in bed? - I'll help.
UNK: Would you just go back to bed? Go!
UNK: Cristina struggling to reach Kalpana's chart : Oh, God. You know, Izzie, if she's on OCPs, can we mark it down, OK?
Kalpana : Yeah.
