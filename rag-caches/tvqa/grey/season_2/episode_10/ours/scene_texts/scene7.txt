Izzie : I'm sorry.
Olivia : I wasn't trying to get you in trouble, but Dr. Shepherd needed to know.
UNK: - It doesn't mean you're a bad doctor. - Lately, I'm crap.
Olivia : Yeah, well, things have been kind of crappy for me too lately.
Alex : Also my fault.
UNK: Olivia shrugs : We both made mistakes.
Alex : Let me ask you something.
Alex : When we were together... it was good, right?
Olivia : You mean...
Olivia : Yeah... it was good.
Olivia : It was really good.
Olivia : It was pretty great.
Alex : It was, wasn't it? It was like, easy, simple.
Olivia : You... better have a condom this time.
UNK: Derek points to the computer screen with scans of Mr. Martin's brain : There it is. It's on the S1 vertebra.
Meredith : So removing it should fix the problem?
Derek : Doesn't look like there's nerve damage.
Derek : There shouldn't be any long-term effect.
Derek : I'd wait a few weeks before I tested it out, though.
Meredith : Funny. You're a funny man.
Derek : I just didn't know you two were dating.
Meredith : You knew it would happen eventually.
UNK: "Eventually" feels a lot different than "actually."
Meredith : Yeah, I guess it does.
UNK: Derek sighs : Well, it's surprisingly painful.
Meredith : It gets better.
Derek : Does it?
UNK: Well, I don't know, but I'm determined to be optimistic.
Derek : So you officially signed your contract. Congratulations.
Addison : - Time to move forward. - Yeah, it is.
Addison : We're OK, right?
Derek : Yeah. We're OK.
Addison : It's Dorie.
Tom : - What's going on? - There's fetal distress.
Dorie : My contractions are really hurting.
UNK: And I think my water broke.
Izzie : Her placenta's tearing.
Addison : OK, Dorie, we can't wait any longer. The babies have to come out now.
UNK: It's OK. We're gonna take really good care of you. Just keep breathing.
Addison : Dorie, the OR is prepped and ready to go. Where's Tom?
UNK: - He's home with the boys. - No, I called Tom. He's on his way.
UNK: Izzie, page everyone on Dorie's team. The list is at the nurse's station.
Addison : Dorie, you're fine. You're going to be fine.
Dorie : Nothing about this is fine. It's too early. They're too hurt.
Izzie : Dorie, you've carried your girls this far.
Izzie : Now it's our turn. You have to trust us to bring them into the world.
Dorie : - Tom's on his way? - Tom's on his way.
MVO : - Hey. - Hey.
Steve : I'll just have to tell you I'm happy to see you.
UNK: Meredith smiles : So Dr. Shepherd removed the tumor without any complications.
UNK: So I just want to thank you. For being there for me.
Steve : I mean, normally, you don't expect your one-night stand
Steve : to stick by you through a tumor.
UNK: - Maybe when I get out, we could... - I don't think so.
Steve : - Sure about that? - Yeah.
Meredith : You know, when I saw you at Joe's, I was just... looking for a replacement.
Meredith : Looking for something to make me feel better.
Meredith : You deserve better than that.
