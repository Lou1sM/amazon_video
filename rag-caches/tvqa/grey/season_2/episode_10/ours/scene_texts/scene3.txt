UNK: How, if she's already having contractions?
Dorie : They can stop them. You're going to Trendelenburg me, right?
Addison : Yes, I am. You've done your reading, Dorie.
UNK: I did it with the triplets.
Dorie : Gravity, remember, Tom?
Dorie : It worked fine then and it'll be fine now.
Addison : Hang in there, Tom. No time for second thoughts now.
UNK: We didn't think that we'd survive a week with the boys, and we did.
UNK: We'll be the same with the girls. We're ready.
Addison : That's all we can do for now. Dr. Stevens, are you on call tonight?
MVO : - No. - You are now.
Bailey : - Enema didn't work. - Enema didn't work?
Bailey : Enema didn't work.
Addison : Huh.
Cristina : - It was an excellent enema. - So, what's the next step?
Cristina : A needle aspiration.
UNK: A needle? My penis?
Meredith : We have to drain the blood.
UNK: Steve shaking his head furiously, loud : No way! No! Forget it!
Bailey : Then you're looking at impotence, penile infarction, or gangrene.
Bailey : - So if you want it to fall off... - No. No, I really don't want that.
Bailey : Then let's get to it. What goes up must come down.
Steve : I feel nauseous.
Meredith : Just lie back, close your eyes, and try to relax.
UNK: If I could relax, I wouldn't be here!
UNK: Tom on phone : Doctor.
Doyle : How is he?
UNK: - Surgery's scheduled for tomorrow. - Anything I can do?
Alex : Don't let him drink any water. Even if he begs.
Alex : Any family we should contact?
MVO : - No. - Friends?
UNK: He doesn't get on with most people. Not big on social skills.
Alex : - Sad guy. - Well, he has me.
UNK: Three years as his assistant. I guess I'm his friend.
UNK: Robert calls out from his room : Doyle!
UNK: What if I just give him back the key?
Meredith : - He'll be hurt. - What if I don't use it?
Meredith : If you had no intention of using it, you shouldn't have taken it.
UNK: Come on. Fishing a key out of a cup isn't like some binding legal contract.
Steve : Your boyfriend gave you a key to his place?
UNK: Cristina gives Steve a look and then looks at Meredith : Why's he talking?
UNK: The guy put himself out. He's taking the next step. You can't not use it.
UNK: Do you think you might not be in the best position right now
Cristina : to be handing out relationship advice?
Steve : Hey, he offered the key, you took the key.
Steve : Just because I'm...
UNK: Look at that!
Cristina : Congratulations. You're flaccid.
Steve : Never thought I'd be so happy to hear that.
UNK: Dr Jones to Radiology. Dr Jones to Radiology.
UNK: Dorie? Tom?
UNK: Addison soft voice : Hey, Dorie. Tom, this is Dr. Burke, he's the head of cardiothoracic surgery,
UNK: Addison soft voice : and Dr. O'Malley, who'll be assisting him.
UNK: Addison soft voice : Dr. Burke wanted to talk about Emily's heart surgery.
Tom : - Heart surgery? - Yes.
UNK: She has a condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
Burke : The surgery will be extensive, and the odds are...
UNK: Dorie interrupts : - We don't believe in odds. - Good. Neither do I.
UNK: But it's important that you understand medically what's going on.
Addison : After she's born, there won't be much time to ask questions.
Cristina : OK.
UNK: - We're listening. - What's wrong with Emily's heart?
UNK: The left-side chambers are underdeveloped.
UNK: And the mitral valve, which connects these chambers, is abnormally narrow.
Burke : It's a key.
Cristina : - Just a key? - Just a key.
Cristina : Good. Good. Good.
UNK: Or you could start thinking about moving in with me.
