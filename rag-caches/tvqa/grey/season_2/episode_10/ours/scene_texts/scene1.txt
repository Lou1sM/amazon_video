Derek : Here's the good news.
Derek : We caught it early. We can take care of it quickly.
Dorie : How?
UNK: I'll install a shunt to drain the fluid.
UNK: You're looking at a full recovery.
UNK: - No brain damage? - No brain damage.
Dorie : OK, really, couldn't you have led with that?
Derek : Good point.
Cristina : What the hell is this?
Burke : - It's a key. - Why?
UNK: Burke smiles : Why is it a key? Are we feeling existential this morning?
Cristina : If a key turns in a lock, and no one asked for the key or even wanted it,
Cristina : does it make a sound?
MVO : Hey.
MVO : Hi.
UNK: I'm going to take this opportunity to be someplace else.
Meredith : - Steve's labs came back clean. - So?
Meredith : So, someone needs to induce vasoconstriction.
Cristina : Nice try with the fancy word. He needs an enema and the answer is "no."
Meredith : I can't do it.
UNK: You let a guy you picked up in a bar see you naked
UNK: - and you can't give him an enema? - Uncalled for.
UNK: - Well, I'm keyed up and cranky. - I'd do it for you.
UNK: Oh, really? You'd give Burke an enema?
George : - Yes. - Uh-huh.
Izzie : - Maybe. - Mm-hm.
Meredith : No. But that's not the point.
UNK: Oh, yeah. OK, here's how it goes.
Cristina : I do this for you and you do every enema I'm assigned to for a month.
Meredith : Deal.
Cristina : You really don't wanna do this.
UNK: - Have we heard from the seller's agent? - I've been calling.
Derek : Mr. Martin, it's good to see you back on solid ground. I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Robert : My assistant, Doyle, says I passed out and hit my head.
UNK: This guy says it's some kind of cyst.
UNK: - I want you to say when I can leave. - A Rathke's cleft cyst.
Richard : - Whatever. - A congenital tumor on your pituitary.
UNK: - Is it treatable? - You'll need surgery.
Derek : - I'm gonna use an endonasal approach. - Endonasal?
UNK: You're going to pull it out through my nose?
Robert : Look him up. Check his credentials.
UNK: It's minimally invasive so there won't be scarring.
Robert : - Good. So, when? - When we stabilize your sodium levels.
Alex : - That means no more water. - I'm thirsty.
UNK: It's a side effect. We'll keep you hydrated intravenously.
Dorie : OK?
UNK: What the hell are you doing?
UNK: I'm just following the doctor's orders.
Steve : - I cannot believe this is happening. - Try being me.
Steve : I mean, you meet someone in a bar, you have a few drinks, a few laughs,
Steve : - you make out in the car... - Roll over to your side.
Cristina : Other side.
Cristina : - Bring your knees up to your chest. - You have a good time.
Steve : Spend the night, wake up the next morning and...
Steve : - OK! - Mm-hm.
Alex : - Still not talking to me? - You gave me syphilis.
Olivia : And I am talking to you. I just don't have anything to say.
Olivia : - How's George? - O'Malley's a fetus.
UNK: He's all whiny and afraid of the light.
Alex : So you didn't tell him you were doing me. Big deal.
UNK: Minimal disclosure, that's my policy.
