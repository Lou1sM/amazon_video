Izzie : Sorry.
Alex : Don't mind me.
Alex : - What's up with Doyle? - I had to fire him.
Robert : Get me some water. I'm drying up.
Alex : Yeah, well, that's the tumor talking. The IV is keeping you hydrated.
UNK: So why'd you fire Doyle? He seemed like a good guy.
Robert : I could see it in his eyes. He didn't respect me anymore.
Alex : He thought he was your friend.
Robert : - Friend? Doyle? - Right. You don't have any friends.
Robert : If I did, I wouldn't let them see me like this.
Robert : Illness is a sign of weakness.
UNK: Once they see it, they look at you differently. You're a hotshot doctor.
Robert : I'm sure you don't let the other hotshot doctors
UNK: - know about your problems. - I'm a hotshot doctor.
UNK: Alex smirks : I don't have any problems.
Robert : Probably don't have any friends either.
UNK: Bailey to Cristina : Oh, my Lord.
UNK: Bailey to Cristina : Oh, child.
Meredith : - Don't tell me. - The flag is flying once again.
Steve : Hey, nothing I did.
Bailey : We've tried everything. It must be neural.
Meredith : - Neural? - She already called for a consult.
Meredith : A consult? You called Neuro for a consult?
Cristina : It's not my fault you broke the boy's penis.
Derek : Hello, everybody, what's up?
UNK: Hm. So when did this problem begin?
Steve : Well, I had an erection last night and woke up with one this morning.
Bailey : Dr. Shepherd, if you don't need me,
Bailey : the other Dr. Shepherd needs a consult on one of the quints.
UNK: Derek looking over Steve's chart : Yeah, no, we're fine. So when did you last ejaculate?
UNK: I'm not sure. Meredith?
Izzie : Oh, I'm... I'm going to go with Dr. Bailey.
UNK: Meredith, what time did we, uh... you know...
UNK: Derek catches on : Yes, Meredith, what time did you two...
UNK: Derek points to the computer screen with scans of Mr. Martin's brain : Here it is. Right there, the omphalocele.
Steve : - Look at that. - That's the scariest word yet.
UNK: All it means is some of the baby's organs are in a sac outside its body.
UNK: Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin, please!
Olivia : Mr. Martin, please, you heard what the doctors said.
Robert : - I don't need any doctors. - Open the door, Martin.
UNK: I'm an island. A beautiful island surrounded by water.
UNK: - What do you want to do? - Shepherd gave me one job to do.
Alex : Keep this dude from drinking water.
Olivia : - Do you want me to page him? - No.
Alex : Get some restraints and turn the water off to the floor.
Alex : Open the door!
Derek : Your CT shows a tumor on your lower spine,
Derek : which is pressing against your cavernous nerve, which is causing the erection.
UNK: A tumor? Right.
UNK: A tumor? So, I should be scared, right?
UNK: This is the time for "scared."
UNK: Meredith looking a little queasy : Um... It's going to be fine.
UNK: Meredith looking a little queasy : Um, Dr. Shepherd is gonna schedule surgery.
Derek : I'll remove the tumor and everything should return to normal.
UNK: "Normal" normal?
Derek : I have a urologist on his way up to talk to you, but yes, "normal" normal.
Steve : Can you call my mom?
