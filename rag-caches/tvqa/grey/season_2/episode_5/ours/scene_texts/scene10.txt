Meredith : I lied.
Meredith : I'm not out of this relationship, I'm in.
Meredith : I'm so in, it's humiliating, because here I am begging.
Derek : - Meredith... - Shut up.
Meredith : You say Meredith and I yell, remember?
Alex : - Yeah. - OK. Here it is.
UNK: Your choice? It's simple. Her or me.
Meredith : And I'm sure she's really great... but, Derek, I love you.
Meredith : In a really, really big, "pretend to like your taste in music,
Meredith : let you eat the last piece of cheesecake,
Meredith : hold a radio over my head outside your window,"
Meredith : unfortunate way that makes me hate you, love you.
Meredith : So pick me.
Meredith : Choose me.
Meredith : Love me.
Meredith : I'll be at Joe's tonight.
Meredith : So, if you do decide to sign the papers, meet me there.
Richard : Goodbye, Ellis.
UNK: I am gonna come see you tomorrow, OK?
Ellis : He doesn't love her.
Derek : He can't.
Ellis : But he'll stay with her anyway. She's his wife.
Meredith : Mom?
Meredith : - Mommy. - Meredith.
Ellis : - You grew up. - I did.
Ellis : It's a shame. It's awful being a grownup.
Ellis : But the carousel never stops turning.
Ellis : You can't get off.
Derek : OK.
Meredith : You think he'll show?
Meredith : He'll show.
Derek : Hey.
Bailey : How's your patient?
UNK: - The one that got her soul back? - She's going to be fine.
Alex : - Gotta go. - Look at you. You look like a girl.
Derek : - Is that your date? - That's my husband.
Derek : - You're married? - Ten years today.
UNK: Derek shocked and smiling : - I didn't know you were married. - You never asked.
Bailey : You haven't signed those divorce papers yet, have you?
Derek : Bailey. Tell me what to do.
Derek : - God, why does this have to be so hard? - It's not hard.
Bailey : It's painful but it's not hard.
UNK: Come on, you know what to do already.
Bailey : If you didn't, you wouldn't be in so much pain.
UNK: Pain. You just have to ride it out.
UNK: Hope it goes away on its own.
UNK: Hope the wound that caused it heals.
Cristina : So here's where we are.
Cristina : I work too much, I'm competitive, I'm always right.
Cristina : - And I snore. - What?
Cristina : I'm trying here.
UNK: Oh... Oh.
Burke : Oh!
Alex : - Yeah. - So?
UNK: OK, we're a couple.
UNK: Izzie cold and sarcastic : Whatever. Don't make a big deal about it.
UNK: There are no solutions.
UNK: No easy answers.
UNK: You just breathe deep and wait for it to subside.
UNK: Oh, man. I just...
UNK: Meredith sighs : He's not coming.
UNK: Meredith sighs : - You don't think he's coming. - He might come.
Cristina : - Yeah. You never know. - He's definitely coming.
UNK: Ow!
UNK: George to Izzie & Cristina : Want her doing tequila shots all night? I'll be the one cleaning up the vomit.
UNK: George to Izzie & Cristina : Besides, I touched a heart today, Porny.
UNK: Most of the time, pain can be managed.
UNK: Meredith to Joe : Pour me another one.
UNK: But sometimes, the pain gets you when you least expect it.
Joe : I'm telling you. Any second.
UNK: Hits way below the belt and doesn't let up.
Addison : I have been looking... everywhere for you.
Meredith : Well...
Derek : - You found me. - So...
UNK: you going to sign those divorce papers or not?
UNK: Pain. You just have to fight through.
UNK: Because the truth is you can't outrun it.
UNK: And life always makes more.
