George : Thank you, sir.
Meredith : OK, Anna, we're going to shut off the PCA pump now,
Meredith : which means you'll be in a lot of pain for the duration of...
UNK: Anna interrupts : - The healing ritual. - Are you OK with that?
UNK: Yeah. They can't find my soul if I'm medicated.
Anna : - No pain, no gain, right? - It's not just for your father.
Meredith : You believe it too, right?
Anna : I know it sounds like a load of crap but watch the ritual. You'll see.
Meredith : - See what? - The moment it happens.
Cristina : I'm ready.
UNK: "Oh, yes! I'm so very, very naughty,"
Cristina : Bianca said as she dropped her stethoscope.
UNK: "Me too!" said Crystal as she snapped on her surgical glove.
Cristina : And then there was Marta...
Cristina : - Where was I? - Marta.
Cristina : Oh, yes. Marta was the naughtiest nurse of all because she knew how...
CRISTINA : - Oh, thank God. - We're back up.
Derek : How long do you think it takes to retrieve a lost soul?
Meredith : I don't know.
UNK: Izzie smiling : - Way to go, George. - I have my finger in a heart.
Izzie : Very cool.
Izzie : - You have stress cardiomyopathy. - Cardiomyopathy?
UNK: - What... Can you tell me what that is? - It's Ted.
UNK: Meredith interrupts : Ted?
Izzie : Ted. Not just the neighbor you barely knew, was he?
UNK: Verna trying to not get emotional : I don't know what you're talking about.
Izzie : Every year, on the day he died, you get a rush of adrenaline caused by stress.
Izzie : Your pressure rises, you have chest pains... and you end up here.
Verna : 27 years.
Verna : I loved the man next door, and he loved me.
Verna : I know how this is gonna sound but... Ted was my soul mate.
Verna : And then he just died.
UNK: It's grief.
UNK: Izzie quietly : Your heart stops because you're grieving for Ted.
UNK: So... what do I do next?
UNK: Verna teary : I mean, how do you treat it?
Izzie : I wish I knew.
Ellis : I told Thatch I'm leaving him.
Richard : You left Thatcher, Ellis, but I couldn't bring myself to leave Adele.
Richard : Do you remember?
Ellis : Painted horses.
Richard : Yes. We were on the carousel in the park. It was raining.
Ellis : - I have an offer from Boston General. - You took it to get away.
UNK: We swore we'd never talk again about what we had together.
Richard : It was gonna always be our secret.
UNK: Richard?
Richard : Yes, Ellis?
Ellis : Carousels give me the creeps.
Cristina : How do you put up with it?
UNK: I mean, <i>Nasty, Naughty Nurses 4 and, I'm assuming, </i>1, 2 and 3.
UNK: Mrs. Lamott : - He's my Henry. - I know.
UNK: But don't you find it misogynistic and degrading and kind of...
UNK: I mean, 24 hours a day of porn?
UNK: Seriously? That's your life?
UNK: Mrs. Lamott : I'm grateful for it. It takes away his pain.
UNK: See, the thing is, Henry...
UNK: Mrs. Lamott : Henry takes away my pain.
