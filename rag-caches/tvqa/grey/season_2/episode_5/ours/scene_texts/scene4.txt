Alex : - And? - I can't hear a systolic over 50.
George : He's gonna die.
UNK: - Intubate him. I'll be back. - Where are you going?
Burke : To get an instrument tray. You guys are going to have to open up his chest.
Bailey : - Are you sure about that? - No.
George : When's Burke coming back?
UNK: When is Dr. Burke coming back?
UNK: Izzie huffs : - Alex... - Oh, would you shut up?
UNK: Mr. Chue. You want to take Anna home for a healing ritual?
UNK: Mr. Chue : When sickness comes, it means that one of our souls is missing.
UNK: Anna needs to have her souls intact before surgery.
UNK: Mr. Chue : - She needs a shaman. - Well, you could have told me that.
UNK: Why? So you could call me a fool?
Derek : I respect that you have traditions that I can't understand.
Derek : But you're standing beside me in a $3,000 suit
UNK: so I know you respect that I'm telling you
UNK: Anna needs surgery in the next 24 hours if she's going to continue to walk.
Derek : She can't leave this hospital.
UNK: Mr. Chue : She can't undergo surgery without her soul. She'd die.
UNK: Bailey starts walking off : All right then.
Derek : We're just gonna have to get a shaman. Today. In the hospital.
UNK: Shamans aren't in the Yellow Pages.
UNK: Mr. Chue mildly amused : Our shaman is 500 miles from here. You are an arrogant man.
Derek : No. I'm just a guy with access to a helicopter.
UNK: Izzie cold and sarcastic : Thank you.
UNK: Mr. Chue : - Finding her soul won't be easy. - It never is.
UNK: This is unconscionable. Not enough power to move those elevators?
UNK: They're replacing the backup. Fire department is standing by.
Richard : - Critical patients? - Moved to south wing.
Richard : - Incoming trauma? - Rerouted to Mercy West.
UNK: - That backup should have been replaced. - Yes, sir.
UNK: Richard angry : - Why didn't it happen? - Chief, you'd have to ask maintenance.
UNK: - I wouldn't know. - Dr. Bailey, you know everything.
UNK: Richard interrupts : Tell me whose butt to kick.
Bailey : That would be your butt, Chief.
Bailey : You didn't authorize the replacement generator,
UNK: saving money for the new MRI machine.
UNK: Mrs. Lamott : Um...
Bailey : I need to get on back down to the... OR.
UNK: Hey, this isn't gonna be too sterile, but we can still try.
Burke : Prep and drape the patient.
