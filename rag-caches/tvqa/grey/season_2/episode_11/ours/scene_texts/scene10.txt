UNK: I'm sorry, they freak me out.
George : - I'm a surgeon, Olivia. - You're an intern, George.
Karl : You know what time it is?
Karl : Time for you two kids to kiss and make up, that's what time it is.
George : Mr. Murphy, we are not a couple.
Karl : Oh, you can't pull much over on me.
Karl : I say there's something between the two of you.
Olivia : You're right, Mr. Murphy, there was.
UNK: George looks up shocked : Olivia, this isn't the time and this really isn't the place.
UNK: He broke up with me for a girl who doesn't know he's alive.
UNK: - She does know. - You, Meredith Grey?
Olivia : Never gonna happen.
UNK: - Why would you think it's Meredith? - Anyone paying attention
UNK: knows how you feel about her.
Olivia : Except Meredith, which should tell you something.
Olivia : Sorry, Mr. Murphy.
George : She gave me syphilis.
Addison : Remember what you did to me when I was an intern?
Richard : How could I forget?
Richard : You didn't speak to me for almost a year.
Richard : But you learned.
Addison : Yeah, well, I think I gotta do that to Izzie Stevens.
UNK: Well, she's smart, hard-working. Gets a little too involved with her patients.
UNK: Richard half nods : - A lot like you. - I know.
UNK: Addison stands up : It took me a long time to recover.
Richard : But it made you a better surgeon, Addison.
Richard : The question is, is she talented enough to make the lesson worth it?
Addison : She's the best I've seen in years. I was hoping that we could...
UNK: Richard interrupts : You're not here to make friends. You're here to make better surgeons.
UNK: And being the teacher can be a Ionely business.
Izzie : I'm telling you, Meredith was all over him.
Cristina : Seriously? She was all over him?
UNK: Mounting him? With the babies watching?
UNK: She would have been if I hadn't interrupted.
George : - She was talking to him. - You don't talk to bastards who cheat.
UNK: - You weren't his girlfriend. - Not the point.
UNK: It is. I don't get emotional over people I'm not dating.
Alex : Really?
UNK: You want to go there?
MVO : - No. - I am having a moment here.
Izzie : Don't mess with me.
Cristina : You're not gonna have a nervous breakdown or kill yourself?
MVO : No.
Cristina : So... there's no chance you'll kill us?
George : - Oh, that was wrong on so many levels. - So good.
UNK: - That was... That was good. - It was good. It was good.
Meredith : Your lungs are not good.
Meredith : I know we got you out of there a little earlier than you would have wanted.
Meredith : We have to find something to help you.
Meredith : So, if you have any ideas, Charlotte...
Addison : - Dr. Stevens. - Dr. Shepherd.
Izzie : - Something you need? - Yes, Dr. Burke and I have reassessed.
Addison : There's a chance with the Norwood
Addison : if Emily can make it through the next ten hours.
UNK: - Would you look after her tonight? - I was on call last night.
Izzie : - But, I mean, yeah, of course. - Good.
UNK: I've left a list of meds, and you're familiar with pediatric life support?
UNK: Got certified soon as I got in the program.
Addison : OK, then.
Izzie : Anything else I should know to look out for?
Addison : No. That should do it.
Izzie : - Should I notify Mrs. Russell... - No. I've done that.
Addison : Dr. Stevens, this baby is your responsibility.
UNK: Addison interrupts : - She better be alive when I get back. - OK.
UNK: I found studies where they used aggressive plasmapheresis.
UNK: - This could work on Mr. Martin. - Those were all isolated cases.
UNK: Alex sighs : The studies resulted in improved symptoms.
UNK: No trials have been done. There is nothing you can do.
Alex : - What about thyrotropin? - No.
UNK: - There's European studies... - Karev, it's over. You screwed up.
UNK: You fried Mr. Martin's brain.
UNK: Derek interrupts : He wakes up; you put him in a wheelchair. He dies; you killed him.
UNK: Meredith smiles : Deal with it.
