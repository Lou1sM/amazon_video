MVO : Nothing.
UNK: Dr. Frank to Oncology.
Izzie : OK.
George : There we are. He's in.
Olivia : I had no idea that you and Alex were a couple.
Olivia : It's just...
Olivia : I was having a bad day and it was good to have someone...
Olivia : To talk to, I mean, not good to...
Olivia : Alex really is good.
Olivia : I mean, he's good in the way he's a good person, good.
Olivia : Not the other kind of good.
UNK: You know, "good in bed" good.
Olivia : Which he is, as I'm sure you know.
Cristina : But...
Olivia : OK. Well, bye.
Derek : - Any temperature spikes? - No fever. Vitals are stable.
Derek : Very good.
Derek : - Go ahead, after you. - Thanks.
Meredith : - So, you're giving up the trailer? - I'm not giving up the trailer.
Derek : Is Addison telling people that I'm giving it up?
UNK: It's just funny. I just would never have pegged you for that guy.
Derek : What guy?
UNK: You know, the marbled bath, private pool, gated community guy.
Derek : - Don't peg me. I'm not peggable. - You're pegged. Deal with it.
Nurse : - BP's low. She's tachycardic. - SATS?
UNK: Dropping on high-flow O2.
UNK: - No breathing sounds. - Her lung collapsed.
UNK: - Should I call Addison? - No time.
UNK: Stick this between her second and third rib. Do not go too deep.
UNK: You're going to hear a small gush of air.
Meredith : I heard it.
Derek : - Nice job. - Thank you.
Derek : - I'm not giving up the trailer. - Whatever you say, Dr Shepherd.
Tom : - Her lung collapsed? - And I know it sounds scary,
Meredith : but it's really not that uncommon in a preemie this size.
Meredith : So, we've inserted a tube into Charlotte's chest
Meredith : and that will help her breathe until her lung can stay up on its own.
Meredith : Mrs. Russell...
Meredith : She really is doing fine now.
Tom : That's me. I gotta go.
Tom : My mom can only handle the triplets for half a day. She's 74 so...
UNK: - I'll call you when I get home, OK? - Hmm.
UNK: Tom to Dorie : I love you.
Tom : - Could you... - I'll keep an eye on her.
Cristina : - Thank you. - OK.
UNK: Dr. Prunella to ICU, stat.
Meredith : Dorie... this isn't your fault.
Meredith : You can't blame yourself for this.
Dorie : I've got one baby who can barely breathe and one with half a heart.
Dorie : Two of the others are...
UNK: If I'd listened to the doctors I could have had three healthy girls
UNK: instead of four who might not live until tomorrow.
Dorie : It was my decision.
Dorie : Tom agreed with the doctors.
Dorie : So, really, Dr. Grey...
Dorie : who else should I blame?
Izzie : First step in the Norwood is cardiopulmonary bypass.
Burke : With HLHS, what else do you get besides hypoplasia of the ventricle?
