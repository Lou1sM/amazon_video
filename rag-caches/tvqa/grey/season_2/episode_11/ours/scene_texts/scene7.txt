Constance : Hey! Hey, you! Hey, Nurse!
Nurse : - Would you keep it down, please? - I'm starving.
Nurse : You're NPO. No food allowed.
Constance : Come on, April, baby, don't go for him. He's such an idiot.
Constance : I didn't come here to starve to death. I want mint-chocolate-chip ice cream.
UNK: Mint, OK? Not Rocky Road. You better not get me that Rocky Road. It sucks.
Constance : Thank God. Mama Bear, help me out here, OK? I'm starving.
Bailey : Don't give her anything.
Constance : Right there you're in official violation of the Eighth Amendment.
UNK: You can't eat because you're about to undergo major surgery.
UNK: What? What's she talking about?
Bailey : You're at risk for a perforated intestine
Bailey : and half a dozen kinds of infection. We need to operate right away.
UNK: Constance scoffs : I don't need an operation. I taped up the blade. It passes the next day.
UNK: Constance scoffs : - What's the big deal? - You swallowed four blades.
Cristina : That's the big deal.
UNK: I thought it would buy me an extra day.
UNK: Constance shrugs : Does this operation have a nice long recovery time?
Cristina : You realize this is major surgery? It's dangerous and you could die.
Constance : Mint chocolate chip.
UNK: I want at least a gallon after you ghouls are done splitting me open.
