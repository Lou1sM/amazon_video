UNK: Dr. Stevens, the baby's VO2 is still 40 per cent after transfusion.
UNK: Izzie nods : - How's her BP doing? - Still low. Last systolic was 52.
UNK: OK, I'm going to push 30cc's of NS manually.
Nurse : Nice start. Pressure's 65.
Meredith : - Hey, Iz. - OK, really?
Izzie : You think I'm talking to you?
Meredith : Well, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Izzie : What are you sorry for?
Izzie : When Derek broke up with you, I never said "You're better off without him."
Izzie : It's not supportive, it's condescending.
Izzie : I was there. All I ever am is there for you guys, and the one time I need you...
Izzie : Just... go away, Meredith.
Nurse : She was fine then she just started seizing.
UNK: She's not seizing, she's choking.
UNK: Oh, my God. She swallowed a light bulb.
Nurse : - We're losing her. - Don't you think I can see that?
Cristina : She needs an airway.
Cristina : She's clamped down. I can't intubate. We need some help in here!
UNK: - Want me to get paralytics? - No, she'll be dead by then.
Cristina : I need a scalpel for a crich.
UNK: - Have you done one ever? - Of course not! Go!
Cristina : I was gonna do a crich.
Burke : - How long has she been unconscious? - She just went down.
UNK: Prep OR Two. Emergency thoracotomy. Cristina, it'll be OK. Come on.
Nurse : - She's coding. - Again?
