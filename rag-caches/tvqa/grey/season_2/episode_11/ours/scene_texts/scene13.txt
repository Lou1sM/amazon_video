Derek : I'm not moving.
Meredith : - You're still you? - I'm still me.
Izzie : Good.
Izzie : - Where's Emily? - They took her away.
Izzie : - Where? Why didn't you wake me? - Dr. Shepherd told us not to.
UNK: Izzie angry : What?
Izzie : Where's the baby?
Nurse : Dr. Stevens, she died half an hour ago.
Addison : It wasn't your fault.
Izzie : You put me in charge. I fell asleep. I killed that baby.
Addison : No, you didn't. She was going to die anyway.
Addison : She had a restricted atrial septum and virtually no aorta.
Addison : As soon as Dr. Burke opened up her chest, we knew she didn't have a chance.
UNK: Izzie shakes her head, upset : I don't get it.
UNK: Izzie shakes her head, upset : You order me to stay the night, take care of her.
UNK: I work my ass off doing CPR, pumping her full of every drug on the planet.
UNK: Izzie shakes her head, upset : God, do you have any idea how scared I was? And it was all for nothing?
UNK: Hardly. This comes up again, you'll be able to handle the pressure.
UNK: Izzie angry : - You lied to me. - You have to learn distance, Stevens.
Addison : You'll be a better doctor for it.
Richard : A better...
UNK: Izzie disbelievingly : A better doctor?
UNK: I heard you worked a miracle last night.
Meredith : She came around so fast I thought the equipment was malfunctioning.
Meredith : - Her SATS are completely stable. - She's going to make it.
Bailey : Go home, Grey. You've earned it.
UNK: Oh, Grey.
Bailey : Way to go.
UNK: Meredith to the two quints : Did you hear that? Way to go.
Izzie : - My baby died. - We know.
UNK: She just... died.
Meredith : I have an idea.
UNK: The first person I killed, I was a second-year resident.
Derek : James Hanson.
Derek : You should go home, Alex. There's nothing you can do here.
Alex : Nobody should die alone.
UNK: 400 years ago
UNK: another well-known English guy had an opinion about being alone.
UNK: John Donne. He thought we were never alone.
UNK: Of course, it was fancier when he said it.
Cristina : Don't try and talk.
Cristina : Your windpipe was perforated.
Cristina : Dr. Burke repaired it and you should be fine.
Cristina : We'll keep you here at least ten days for observation.
Cristina : Make sure there's no infection.
Cristina : Maybe just to be on the safe side, we'll make it two weeks.
UNK: "No man is an island, entire unto himself. "
Meredith : - Oh, that's him. - Yeah. That's him.
UNK: I'm Ionely, Derek.
UNK: Boil down that island talk
UNK: and he just meant that all anyone needs is someone to step in...
UNK: ... and let us know we're not alone.
Izzie : Get it. Good boy.
UNK: - Ready? Good boy, Doc. - OK.
UNK: And who's to say that someone can't have four legs?
UNK: Someone to play with or run around with...
UNK: High jump.
UNK: ... or just hang out.
