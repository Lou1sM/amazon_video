Izzie : OK, uh... Turn up... Turn up the epi drip.
Izzie : OK.
Izzie : OK.
Izzie : OK.
Meredith : - Hey, Dorie. What are you doing? - I'm packing.
Meredith : You've just had major abdominal surgery.
UNK: - You're not in any condition... - I'm going home.
UNK: Dorie interrupts : I need to go home. I can't be here. I can't watch them die.
Meredith : They're not dying. They're trying to live.
Meredith : You leaving them isn't going to help them.
UNK: - I have boys who need me. - Your daughters need you.
Dorie : Don't you understand that I can't do it?
Dorie : I can't do it.
Dorie : - They're too sick. - Which is why they need their mother.
UNK: Meredith interrupts : - If Emily dies I... - If Emily dies it will be horrible.
UNK: But if Emily dies and you're not here?
Dorie : - I can't even hold them. - But you can sit with them
Meredith : and talk to them.
Meredith : And let them know they're not alone in this world. That's all they need.
UNK: That's all anybody...
UNK: Izzie angry : - What? - I think I know how to help Charlotte.
Meredith : I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner.
Meredith : - What are you doing? - Co-bedding.
Meredith : Hospitals sometimes do it with twins when one of them is sick.
Dorie : - And the other one gets better? - It helps.
Dorie : - How? - We don't really know.
UNK: Meredith she removes Kate from the incubator : Sometimes babies get stressed in the ICUs from all the activity.
Meredith : This way there's someone there to comfort them.
Meredith : To be there with them.
UNK: Excellent blood flow at all three places. You're healing nicely.
Karl : - And I like my new nose. - Your wife will like it, too.
UNK: I'm not so sure what she'll say about your new houseguests.
UNK: I'm going to let these guys go in the lake near my favorite hiking trail.
UNK: They saved my face. The least I can do for 'em. And I don't have a wife.
UNK: - I'm sorry. Your wedding ring... - I'm divorced. Just never took it off.
UNK: By the way... sorry you had to see that little scene earlier.
Karl : Talking with the girl who isn't your girlfriend
Karl : about the girl you'd like to be your girlfriend?
Izzie : Yeah.
George : She shouldn't have said that stuff. It was just...
UNK: She was very unprofessional.
UNK: Yeah, but is it true?
UNK: Do you like this Meredith?
UNK: George discomfited : I don't think that's really any of your business.
UNK: George discomfited : She's OK.
UNK: George discomfited : I like her OK.
UNK: George discomfited : All right. I love her.
UNK: Karl chuckles : Oh, come on. Don't be embarrassed.
UNK: Karl chuckles : I loved my wife.
UNK: Karl chuckles : But sometimes, no matter how much you love someone,
UNK: Karl chuckles : they just can't love you back in the same way.
UNK: Believe me, son, livin' with a woman who can't love you back?
UNK: Way Ionelier than bein' alone.
Nurse : What do you wanna do?
Izzie : - We can... we can put her on ECMO. - Baby this size,
UNK: you're risking intracranial hemorrhage.
UNK: She's already coded three times. You page Dr. Shepherd?
UNK: She said you have to handle this.
UNK: - What? I'm an intern. What is... - Dr. Stevens...
Izzie : - Give me a second. - You don't have a second.
UNK: ECMO is too dangerous. We're gonna have to keep her going on epi.
UNK: It'll stop her circulation. No point keeping her heart rate up
UNK: if she doesn't have functioning limbs.
UNK: Izzie angry : I know that.
Meredith : I'm sorry.
Addison : Let's...
UNK: We have to keep pushing epi. It's our best option.
UNK: We'll just have to find a middle ground.
UNK: Izzie to Emily : You can do this.
Meredith : I can't believe you would consider moving out of your trailer.
Meredith : The view alone.
Derek : - See the mist rise off the lake. - Yeah.
Izzie : Yeah.
