Scott : - My mom's OK, right? - Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Scott : They'd been fighting at breakfast.
UNK: Dad... It's ugly when it gets like that.
Scott : He ran three stop lights before we even got on the freeway.
UNK: - My husband Bob is a good driver. - Some guy in a pickup cuts us off.
UNK: Safe. I think he saw something in the middle of the road and...
Scott : - My dad just lost it. ...and swerved to avoid it.
Scott : - Started chasing the guy. - The crash just came out of nowhere.
Scott : Blasting through traffic.
Lea : We'd been having a really nice morning.
Lea : One minute everything's fine and the next...
Scott : - Screaming at him. - I saw his face before we hit.
UNK: Then we're upside down across the freeway.
UNK: Do the surgeons know Bob has a bad liver?
Cristina : - They know. - How's Scotty?
UNK: Your son's next door getting X-rayed.
Scott : - My dad, he... - He's in surgery. It's pretty serious.
Scott : Yeah? Well.
UNK: I guess the son of a bitch got what he deserved.
