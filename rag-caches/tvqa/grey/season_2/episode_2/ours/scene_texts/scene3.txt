Cristina : Oh. This looks pretty bad. How'd you get this?
Lea : Well, we hit so hard...
UNK: I don't think it's from the collision. It looks a couple of weeks old.
Bailey : Where are you?
George : I can see his heart. His heart that's not beating.
UNK: OK, open the pericardium and aspirate.
UNK: If the heart's still not beating, close and call it.
Bailey : What? You think we're defiling this man's body?
George : Well, we're certainly doing more than...
Bailey : Than what?
Bailey : If they're dead or dying when they come in you hump and hump hard. Why?
George : - For the experience. - No. What else? There's something more.
Bailey : You think on that. It'll come to you.
Meredith : Mr. Hubble, you might make things a little easier on yourself
UNK: if you would just tell us what you've ingested.
Meredith : We'll know anyway, once we see your films.
UNK: Mr. Hubble : You have the most beautiful features. They're delicate. Almost porcelain.
Meredith : Mr. Hubble, whatever you've ingested could kill you.
Meredith : Are you sure you don't want to tell me what's got you blocked up inside?
UNK: - It might offend you. - Is it drugs?
UNK: Mr. Hubble : - It's not drugs. - Mr. Hubble...
UNK: Mr. Hubble : I promise. It's not drugs.
UNK: OK. Well, good. I'm glad it's not drugs.
UNK: It's drugs. Looks like at least ten balloons in his bowel.
Radiologist : My guess, cocaine.
UNK: Scott Seibert, 18. No fractures or internal bleeding. Got pretty lucky.
Bailey : - Recommendation? - Overnight for observation.
Bailey : - Damn! - Lea Seibert, 43.
UNK: Multiple healed fractures on clavicle and humerus. Third and fourth rib.
Bailey : She's either a bull rider or she's abused.
Alex : Kid said the accident was road rage.
Alex : His old man got cut off in traffic.
Cristina : That's not the story I got.
Cristina : She has a large yellowing bruise over her right kidney, tender to palpation.
Cristina : Said she got it from a fall last week. She's bleeding.
Bailey : Perinephric hematoma. What do you do?
Cristina : It should take care of itself. We'll watch it.
UNK: She needs bed rest. And a shrink.
Meredith : - It's drugs. - Stupid. Stupid, stupid.
UNK: One bursts and he's dead in five minutes.
UNK: - OK, what do we do? - Run his bowel?
Bailey : And what does that mean? Yang?
Cristina : Running the bowel entails removing all 36 feet of the intestine
UNK: from the body cavity, searching for the balloons then cutting them out.
Bailey : Grey, book an OR. Yang, Karev, you're in. I need all the hands I can get.
Alex : You sure they're balloons?
UNK: You have reason to believe they're not?
UNK: This one here's got a face.
Meredith : So does that one.
Cristina : They all do.
Bailey : I'll be damned. They're Judys.
Cristina : Judys?
UNK: He's swallowed the heads of ten Judy dolls.
UNK: Eugh.
Cristina : My mother used to buy me Judy dolls.
Cristina : Manhattan Judy, Surfer Judy, Disco Judy.
UNK: - I wanted one. - I dissected them.
UNK: Cut off their arms and shaved their heads.
UNK: Sounds like a sick and twisted story.
Cristina : They're sexist, distorted devil toys that create unrealistic expectations
UNK: catering to the porn-driven minds of men.
Bailey : You swallow a bitter pill this morning, Yang? They're dolls.
Bailey : Grey, call for a Psych consult, then see if he has family.
Meredith : - Do I still book the OR? - Blocked bowels become necrotic bowels.
Bailey : Check with Dr. Burke. See if we can bump someone.
UNK: Those Judys got to come out today.
Nurse : - Hanging another B neg. - Using a lot of blood.
Nurse : - Noted. - What's the word from UNOS?
