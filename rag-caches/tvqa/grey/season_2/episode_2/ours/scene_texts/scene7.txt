UNK: He's an alcoholic wife beater. Shouldn't be a question.
UNK: If you didn't save him, wouldn't it be like murder?
UNK: Like when he crashed into George's DOA? He's the killer, not the son.
George : - That is sick. - Who would do that?
Bailey : Oh.
Cristina : Look! See Judy fly.
UNK: - Hey, George? - Hey.
Derek : What?
Meredith : George. She was trying to make up with you. You should go eat with her.
George : No. No, I shouldn't.
Izzie : She likes you. Don't let the syph get in the way.
George : - It's not the syph. - So the syph.
UNK: - It is not the syph. - Then what is it?
Bailey : Oh.
Derek : What?
Bailey : What is it?
MVO : - Say. - There's another girl.
George : - Izzie! - You have another girl?
Izzie : - He hasn't told her yet. - It's not high school.
Izzie : - George has a little crush. - I do not.
George : It is a thing. A thing that is very personal.
UNK: One day I'd like to build on this thing with this other girl... woman.
George : She's all woman.
Meredith : - What are you doing? - I was playing with...
UNK: Meredith interrupts : No, George, with Olivia. What are you doing with Olivia?
Meredith : - Nothing. - She thinks you're available.
UNK: She thinks she has a chance.
Meredith : There is nothing worse in the world
Meredith : than thinking you have a chance when you really don't.
Cristina : Meredith is right. Tell her there's someone else. Tell her why.
Cristina : At least give her the chance to have some feelings about it for God's sake!
UNK: George shocked : - Why are you yelling at me? - Because of the estrogen, George!
Izzie : So, new subject.
Derek : - It's a mess. - No, it isn't.
Derek : I think I know a mess when I see a mess.
UNK: You got the harvest tying up OR One, Seibert tying up OR Two...
Burke : It's simply a bit crowded.
Derek : Your "crowded" is my "seriously overbooked."
Derek : And in my book, seriously overbooked is a mess.
UNK: Is there any word on the Seibert liver?
UNK: - How much work do they have left? - Couple of hours.
Burke : - Tell them I'll be in to see them. - You bumped me for a bowel obstruction?
Derek : Uneasy lies the head that wears the chief's cap.
UNK: Code white, code white...
Meredith : Was it an act of desperation?
UNK: Mr. Hubble : - Not at all. - Something to attract attention?
UNK: Mr. Hubble : Of course not.
