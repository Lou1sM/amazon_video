Derek : - That is not it. - Come on, stop it. That's it.
UNK: - It's not. Hold still. - How can I with you poking me?
Derek : I have to poke you to discharge you.
Adele : What makes you think he wants to be discharged?
Adele : Derek, don't you know that this hospital will crumble unless Richard's here?
UNK: Adele. You're meant to be in the Virgin Islands.
UNK: You are in five kinds of trouble, mister man.
Adele : You had brain surgery and didn't tell me?
UNK: - It was a small procedure. - It was brain surgery.
Richard : - Didn't want to ruin your vacation. - You don't know what one is.
Adele : How would you know how to ruin it?
Richard : Well, anyway...
Richard : How did you find...
Richard : - You called my wife? - You called mine.
UNK: Having someone at home with you is the only way I'm letting you out today.
Richard : - Fine. - I thought I saw a great-Iooking woman.
UNK: Addison! Yes, see?
MVO : Hi.
Adele : I told Richard, I knew you and Derek would get back together.
Addison : - I'm here on a case. - Addison and I are over, Adele.
Addison : - It's not like we're divorced. - Practically.
Adele : - You've had counseling? - We had adultery. That was enough.
Addison : I'll call you later, OK?
Adele : You should give her a chance, Derek.
Derek : It's good to see you. Keep him in line.
