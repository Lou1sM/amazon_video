Alex : Just took off and never came back.
UNK: You know, he was a cold, mean-tempered bastard, but he was still my old man.
UNK: And now I can't stop wishing that I'd never laid a hand on him.
UNK: That we somehow could've worked it through.
Bailey : What is it?
Izzie : Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.
UNK: Alex interrupts : What? What does Burke want?
Izzie : I'm sorry, Scott. He needs a decision now.
UNK: Lea to Dr. Burke : When would it happen?
UNK: We would take Scotty to pre-op immediately.
UNK: Burke walks over to the bed : The transplant surgeon is on call and waiting. There isn't much time.
Lea : Scotty?
Lea : Scotty.
UNK: Yeah. OK. I want to do it.
UNK: Burke heads to the door : - Let's get him to pre-op. - But I have a couple of conditions.
UNK: You're going tell the cops the truth about what happened in this accident.
Scott : And as soon as we get back home, you and I are moving out.
Scott : Enough is enough.
UNK: 18-year-old male, liver donor, no malignancy or transmittable diseases.
UNK: ETA about ten minutes.
UNK: You know she's going to go back to him.
UNK: - I don't know that. And it's not my... - This is not our call.
Burke : Well, Cristina...
Burke : I was wondering... I mean, I was hoping that we can...
Burke : - I know we didn't... - You're asking me...
UNK: Are you OK?
Cristina : Can I scrub in?
Cristina : Then, yes, Dr. Burke. I'm OK.
Burke : Karev. Let's get him to pre-op.
UNK: Derek points at the screen : You see the tumor on her brain stem here?
Cristina : Looks pretty bad.
Derek : You ever had a crappy day, O'Malley? I mean, really, really crappy.
UNK: I've had many crappy days.
Derek : This one just got better. You should go home, gentlemen.
Derek : I will be the only one of us performing surgery today.
Derek : My friend here has a viable brain.
Cristina : OK.
UNK: Do you really think she'll be OK?
UNK: I get the tumor out, she's got a good shot of recovery.
Derek : Look out for her.
George : Meredith?
Alex : Yeah.
Bailey : Oh.
Izzie : Um...
George : - Is it the family of the dead guy? - Yeah.
