George : - Any family members waiting? - Trying to reach them.
George : Good. I mean, not good that we haven't reached them.
UNK: - It's just good I don't have to... - It's always hard.
Alex : Yeah.
Olivia : I'm sorry about Alex.
George : That's fine. It's good, you know.
George : No need to talk about it.
UNK: You do understand that I had sex with him before you. Not during.
Olivia : Because when you and I were having sex...
George : - I understand. - Just wanted to clear the air.
George : It's clear.
George : - Perfectly clear. OK. - OK.
Olivia : - And about the syphilis... - We don't have to talk about this.
Olivia : I mean, I didn't know I had it. I should have. I'm a nurse.
Olivia : I mean, there was the sore and I was all itchy.
UNK: OK. You know, I uh... got it.
George : You know, things happen.
Olivia : They really do. Things you wish you could change.
Alex : Yeah.
UNK: It's the chief. I got to take this.
Olivia : Sure. George?
Olivia : - You have to call it. - Call it?
Medic : - Him. - Oh. Um...
UNK: Time of death 1 : 48.
Alex : I got it.
Alex : This guy came in this morning with ten Judy doll heads in his abdomen.
UNK: Is that some kind of sick or what?
Alex : I mean, when you think about it, those things can't be that easy to swallow.
UNK: They still got their hair on them. That's some bad spaghetti.
Alex : Dude's crapping toys.
Alex : You know, when you're little, you can hide.
Alex : Ignore the shouting, the screaming.
Alex : Pretend like you're someplace else.
UNK: Then when you get older... bigger...
Alex : you feel like you should be doing something.
Alex : Something to stop it. You know, to protect her.
Alex : And when you can't, you don't know who to be angrier at,
Alex : your old man or yourself.
Alex : Usually it's yourself.
Scott : - Did she tell you? - She didn't have to.
Alex : It's all over her films.
Alex : He's not beating you, is he?
Scott : No. Just her.
Scott : So what do you do? About the anger?
Alex : Me? I think about the guy who eats doll heads.
Alex : He's got problems.
Izzie : Hey. I've been looking for you guys.
Scott : It's my father.
Lea : Bob liked his beers. His liver started to fail a couple of years ago.
Lea : He quit drinking and we put him on the transplant list,
Lea : - but his blood type... - B negative.
Lea : There just aren't that many available.
Lea : They suggested a family member.
Burke : Any luck?
Lea : My son.
UNK: They say Scotty's a good match. He's 18...
Cristina : Family members shouldn't do it out of obligation. It's risky.
Lea : Scotty's had counseling.
Lea : You know, they just don't let you do it.
Lea : He hasn't made his mind up yet, you know.
Lea : We actually have a date set for the surgery.
UNK: It's just... I just don't... I don't want to pressure him.
Cristina : Well, then you shouldn't.
Lea : Oh, God... God, I don't want to lose Bob.
Burke : We'll give your son as much time as we can to make a decision.
Burke : - Would you care to explain? - Seibert is a wife beater.
UNK: - Her films show abuse. - I didn't know that.
Cristina : Multiple fractures. She has a kidney bleed from a beating last week.
UNK: Plus, it was his road rage that caused the accident.
Cristina : - The guy in the other car died. - And that means what?
Burke : No heroic measures? We leave him on the table?
Cristina : - If it were up to me... - Think like a surgeon.
Burke : We have a dying patient and a liver match.
UNK: - This is more complicated. - For social workers, yes.
Burke : For the family. Not for you.
Burke : It isn't up to you.
Cristina : Yeah, you've made that perfectly clear.
Burke : - I'm glad we have an understanding. - I'm sure you are.
