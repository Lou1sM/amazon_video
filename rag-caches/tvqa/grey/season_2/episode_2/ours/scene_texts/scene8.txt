Meredith : I'm just trying to understand here, Mr. Hubble. Why ten doll heads?
UNK: Well, because eleven would have been too much.
UNK: What's up, Dick?
UNK: I think it has something to do with his mother.
UNK: Maybe she wanted a girl and gave him Judy dolls as presents.
UNK: I got another one.
Bailey : Doyen clamps to Yang. Grey, push the head to the incision.
Alex : Mother looked like Judy and he's into voodoo.
Alex : Instead of sticking pins in...
Bailey : Yep. Ah.
Bailey : Black Judy.
UNK: Before they gave her long hair. Back when she had the Afro.
UNK: She came with go-go boots and a leather jacket.
Bailey : - Shame. It's a real collector's item. - Collectible dolls. New twist.
UNK: Seriously? You can identify these dolls by their heads?
Bailey : You got a problem with that, Yang? I like Judy dolls. I own Judy dolls.
Bailey : The only problem I have with Judy dolls is they're in the bowel of this man.
UNK: Bailey? I need an intern in the E. R. to meet the harvest donor.
Bailey : - O'Malley. - See you, trooper.
Burke : - You good here? - Couple more to go.
UNK: Karev, Stevens, Yang, scrub out.
UNK: We need to get an answer from Seibert's son.
Bailey : Ah, yes. Mod Judy.
UNK: She came with a yellow Vespa.
UNK: - Wait. You know what's strange? - We haven't had enough strange?
Bailey : She looks a little like you.
Nurse : This is the donor from Wilkeson.
UNK: Put her in here until the harvest team comes down. Thanks.
Cristina : Well, this... this one's heart is still beating.
George : I think Bailey would want me to...
UNK: We reached the family of the dead motorist. Live in Portland.
Olivia : Should be here in a few hours. Want me to page you?
George : - Yeah. Do they know? - Only that we were working on him.
Olivia : I think it's always better to hear bad news first hand.
Olivia : I know I'd like to talk to the doctor who called it.
Olivia : Get some answers.
UNK: So that I could get on with my life.
Olivia : George?
UNK: Did you... Did you see that?
George : She's decerebrate. Her brain's... Her brain stem's still alive.
UNK: - OK. We'll take it from here. Thanks. - Did you look at this?
UNK: She's decerebrate. OK.
UNK: Yeah, she can't really be declared brain dead...
UNK: Dr. Orsen : They probably just missed it. The cortex is dead, the brain stem will follow.
UNK: Dr. Orsen : Death is imminent. We just have to wait.
UNK: - But don't you think... - She'll be dead when we get to the OR.
UNK: George to himself : But she's alive now.
