Izzie : He's on the list, but they don't have a liver.
UNK: Dr. Domner : The list won't help him now. This liver won't stop bleeding.
UNK: Dr. Domner : It won't support his recovery.
Izzie : What about the donor that's coming in?
UNK: That liver's already been committed. His only hope is a family donor.
UNK: Maybe we should call it. No use tying up an OR if it's postponing the inevitable.
Burke : How much work do you have to complete, Dr. Domner?
UNK: - Five, maybe six hours. - That's how long we have to find one.
UNK: Dr. Domner : You're the chief.
