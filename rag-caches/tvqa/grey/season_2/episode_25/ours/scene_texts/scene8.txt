Cristina : He'll probably get a heart at some point,
Cristina : but as long as Denny's doing well on the LVAD
Cristina : and there's someone ahead of him on the list,
Cristina : he's not going to get this heart. OK?
Izzie : Yes. You're right.
Izzie : OK. Thank you. Thank you.
UNK: If I was going to pick someone who'd go psycho and shoot up the place...
Cristina : it's Izzie.
Cristina : Totally.
Denny : - What's all that? - Heart stuff.
UNK: You're putting this heart in me in my room?
Denny : I didn't know transplants were so informal.
Izzie : There may not be a heart, Denny.
Izzie : Somebody at Mercy West might get it instead.
UNK: So this isn't going to happen... again?
Izzie : Not necessarily.
Izzie : I have been over this and over this and it can't be a lie and it can't be fake.
Izzie : We need charts, we need test results.
Izzie : We need UNOS to believe us. So it has to be real.
Denny : What are you talking about, Izzie?
Izzie : In order for you to get the heart, you would have to get worse. Much worse.
Izzie : And you would have to do it very quickly.
Denny : Well, I don't see that happening. You see that happening?
Izzie : I am going to make it happen.
Burke : It's been 30 minutes. Is Stevens answering her page?
UNK: She's probably busy getting test results.
Burke : - Did you call Bailey? - Well, she's not answering either.
Erica : Check the chart all you want. You're not getting this heart.
Burke : Well, you may not want it. His angiogram shows 30% LAD.
Erica : It's still not enough to give it to you.
Denny : Izzie. Izzie, stop and listen to me. We're not doing this.
Izzie : Don't worry. You're not going to die.
UNK: I'll be here the whole time to make sure of that and that's what this is for.
Denny : This isn't about me dying. All right? This is wrong.
UNK: You've waited 18 months to get this. Who knows when the next one will come?
Denny : - I'll take my chances. - No! It may be too late by then.
Denny : Then it's too late! Get this stuff out of here!
Izzie : Denny, please.
Izzie : - You have to do this. - No, Izzie!
Denny : I'm not about to steal a heart from another man's chest.
Denny : Not to mention, this will be the end of your medical career.
Izzie : - I don't care about my medical career. - All right, you know what?
Denny : This has gone on long enough. I'm calling a nurse.
UNK: Everyone's entry into the transplant program is clocked in to the second.
Izzie : You were clocked in to the second and so was the other guy. I checked with UNOS.
Izzie : The difference between when you entered it
UNK: and when he entered it is 17 seconds.
Izzie : That's it, Denny. Seventeen seconds.
Izzie : I mean, it's not even the length of a decent kiss.
Izzie : So this other guy?
Izzie : I'm not saying that he doesn't deserve this heart.
UNK: I'm sure he does. But so do you!
Izzie : So do you!
Izzie : And if you tell me any more crap about heading towards the light
Izzie : or looking down on me from heaven, I swear I will kill you myself.
Denny : Izzie.
UNK: I'm going to be all right.
Denny : All right? You don't have to worry.
Izzie : What about me? What about me when you go to the light?
Denny : - Izzie... - No! I get it, OK? I get it.
Izzie : You'll be OK. You'll be fine, but what about me?
Izzie : So don't do it for yourself. Do it for me! Please!
Izzie : Please, Denny! Please do this for me!
Izzie : Because if you die... Oh, God, you have to do this.
Izzie : You have to do this for me or I'll never be able to forgive you!
Denny : - For dying? - No! For making me love you!
Izzie : Please! Please do this for me.
Izzie : OK? Please! OK? I can't do this if you don't.
Izzie : Please do this for me! Because if you don't do this... Please!
Denny : OK. OK, I'll do it.
