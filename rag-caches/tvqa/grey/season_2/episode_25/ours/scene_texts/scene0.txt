Derek : Let's see what you got here.
UNK: We all know the big ones : Gluttony, pride, lust.
Cristina : He's picturing my face. He's totally picturing that dart puncturing my skull.
UNK: But the sin you don't hear much about is anger.
Cristina : Whoa! Look at that.
UNK: Maybe it's because we think anger's not that dangerous.
UNK: Derek... Derek is picturing you.
UNK: That we can control it.
Meredith : He called me a whore. He lost the right to picture me.
Izzie : - Hmm. - So I fall asleep during sex. So what?
Cristina : Ass.
Cristina : Ass.
Izzie : Oh, ass! Hey!
UNK: Isabel Stevens has left the hospital.
UNK: Did heart patient dude finally kick it?
Izzie : I'm sorry. This section of the bar is for surgeons.
Izzie : We don't socialize with gynecologists.
Izzie : George!
UNK: My point is, maybe we don't give anger enough credit.
Izzie : - Hey. - Hi, Callie.
Cristina : Hi, Dr. Torres.
UNK: Maybe it can be a lot more dangerous than we think.
UNK: After all, when it comes to destructive behavior...
George : Uh, gin and tonic and a beer.
UNK: ...it did make the top seven.
Derek : That's it? That's your diagnosis?
UNK: He said bone cancer, so that would be his diagnosis.
Derek : I heard him. I was double checking.
Finn : I still need to do a bone scan to see how far it's spread.
Finn : Osteosarcomas are aggressive, but we can try and treat it with chemo
Finn : or remove the tumor entirely.
Finn : If it's spread too far, we may have to amputate the limb.
Derek : - At that point, should we even bother? - Oh, right. Let's just let him die.
Derek : - I don't want him to suffer, Meredith. - Right.
Addison : So what's... I mean, is there something going on?
MVO : No.
UNK: - Did you guys have a fight? - No.
UNK: So... we're all still... friends?
UNK: Derek & Meredith : Yes.
Cristina : I heard you might be getting a heart. For a transplant.
Burke : Mercy West has a heart and I'm going to get it, yes.
Cristina : Can I go? Because, um, I've done it before.
Cristina : With Dr. Bailey, when she went to get a heart.
Cristina : You can ask her. I was very helpful.
Burke : Yeah, I'm sure you were. But I'm not going to need your help on this one.
Paramedic : White male. GSW to the left shoulder.
Paramedic : Multiple walking wounded. Five injured coming in behind us.
Meredith : - Why are they all in the hallway? - Overflow from the ER.
Izzie : An employee went postal. Shot up a restaurant.
George : - I heard he got away. - Really?
Cristina : Neal Hannigan and Deborah Fleiss. They were paying when he came in.
Doctor : She's got a through and through to the right arm. Good distal pulses.
Doctor : He's sustained a possible graze wound to the right back.
UNK: Let's irrigate the wound and get them to X-ray and order a tet-tox for both.
Neal : - Take care of my Deborah first. - Oh, now you're concerned.
