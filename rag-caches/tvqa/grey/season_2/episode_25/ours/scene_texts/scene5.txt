Cristina : OK, the X-rays will tell us the location of the bullet.
Deborah : Mine was a through and through, so there's no bullet.
UNK: We'll make sure it didn't hit bone.
UNK: Whatever happens, I want you to operate on my fiancï¿½e first.
Neal : - I don't care if I'm dying. - You're not dying.
UNK: I'm also not your fiancï¿½e anymore.
UNK: We sent out the invitations. We're getting married in six weeks.
Neal : Deborah, please.
Neal : I love you.
Cristina : - Oh, don't fall for it. - Excuse me, but...
Cristina : That's how they do it, huh? With the "I love you's" and the "move in with me's"
Cristina : and they suck you in and they melt your resolve.
UNK: The minute you need something, something you deserve,
UNK: forget it, it's not going to happen.
UNK: They pass you over for surgery or duck behind you when someone's shooting.
Deborah : You're very, very bitter.
UNK: That's exactly what I was thinking! See? We're meant to be together.
Deborah : Shut up, Neal.
Cristina : Mm-hmm.
UNK: There are two donors?
Doctor : Two brothers tried to pass a semi on a double yellow
Doctor : and came out on the losing end of a head-on. Both are a match for your guy.
Alex : - So we get our pick. - It doesn't work like that.
Burke : UNOS has already assigned who gets which donor.
Alex : - So who's retrieving the other heart? - Took you long enough, Preston.
Erica : Why is Junior here? Your ego get too big for one man to carry?
Burke : Dr. Hahn here graduated second in our class at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Karev.
Burke : Ask her who graduated first.
Alex : God.
Addison : Kendra's fetus is 12 weeks along.
Addison : It seems healthy.
Addison : - Did you hear me, Derek? - I heard you.
UNK: You're not going to tell me what's going on between you two?
Derek : - I told you. There's nothing to tell. - Kendra's parents are here.
Derek : Let them know the situation, get the consent forms, then scrub in.
George : - Yes, Dr. Shepherd. - Thank you.
UNK: - What happened to my donor? - He went into v-fib.
UNK: I see. Give me the paddles. Karev, take over compressions! You gave epi?
Doctor : - Three rounds and shocked him twice. - I'm going to hit him again at 360.
Burke : Clear!
Burke : He's asystolic.
Alex : I don't get it. I mean, if the guy's already dead...
Burke : And now his heart has joined the rest of him.
Alex : Hmm. So, we can't use it?
Burke : No, Karev, we cannot use it. The muscle is dead. The heart is useless.
Alex : Dr. Burke?
Burke : Move, move, move, move, move!
Burke : Stop right there! Don't move that scalpel! Not even a single slice!
Erica : Just because your donor's heart died doesn't mean you get mine.
Burke : Is your patient higher on the transplant list? Is he higher on the list?
Erica : - I have no idea. - Well, neither do I.
Burke : Karev, get UNOS on the phone now.
Erica : Oh, give me a break!
