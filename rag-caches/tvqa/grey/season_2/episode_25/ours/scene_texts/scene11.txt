UNK: It's pretty simple really.
UNK: You give in to a sin like envy or pride then you only hurt yourself.
Neal : I love you.
Callie : I'm sorry. I'm...
UNK: I... I didn't mean to... I just...
UNK: I... I have verbal diarrhea and I'm a moron.
Callie : What are you thinking? Are you freaking out or?
Izzie : George, I need your help. I wouldn't ask if it weren't important. It's...
Cristina : OK.
George : I'll call you? Later?
Burke : Sure.
Finn : Were we supposed to have dinner tonight?
Meredith : - Tell me the truth about Doc. - What about him?
Meredith : You've been downplaying how sick he is, haven't you?
Finn : The best-case scenario, I would say Doc has maybe a year left.
Cristina : - OK. - And Doc is not the best-case scenario.
Cristina : - OK. - Meredith?
Meredith : Oh, damn it.
Finn : I am sorry. I'm so sorry. I know how much you love him.
Derek : I do.
Meredith : I love him so much.
George : - You need my help for an EKG? - No. Come.
Izzie : OK, after I do this, I might have to shock you a few times.
George : - Do what? - You feeling good?
Denny : I think so. Explain this to me again.
Izzie : The LVAD has been inserted into your abdomen and is connected to your heart.
UNK: This leads to the power source,
Izzie : this one is connected to the pump that pumps your heart for you.
Izzie : I have the crash cart, the defibrillator, the Ambu bag, saline...
George : Do what, Izzie?
Izzie : Um, I feel like we should say stuff.
Izzie : Denny, do you want to say stuff?
Denny : Kiss me. Right here.
Denny : Izzie, that kiss was worth 1,000 words.
Izzie : A picture. A picture is worth 1,000 words.
UNK: - You're correcting me now? - I don't mean to be intrusive...
UNK: Just give me a second, George!
Izzie : OK, are you ready?
Denny : As I'll ever be.
George : Wait. What are you doing?
UNK: Try lust or coveting and you'll only hurt yourself,
UNK: and probably one or two others.
UNK: But anger... Anger is the worst.
UNK: - OK. We're done! - What was that? Were those gunshots?
UNK: The mother of all sins.
Brad : Petey.
Izzie : Denny. If there really is some kind of big glowy light...
Denny : - I'll try like hell to stay out of it. - Exactly.
UNK: - I don't like the sound of this. - Just make sure nobody comes in.
Addison : What are you doing?
Izzie : I'm stopping his heart, George.
UNK: Not only can anger drive you over the edge,
UNK: when it does, you can take an awful lot of other people with you.
Denny : Izzie.
Bailey : Oh! Dr. Burke. I need some help!
Izzie : It's OK. Burke will be here any minute.
