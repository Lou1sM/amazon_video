Burke : - Hey! Hey! - What? Are you going to beat him up?
Burke : - If I have to. - OK, just hold on.
Erica : It's pathetic, Preston. Really pathetic.
Meredith : I've finished all five of your patients.
Meredith : Do you mind if I scrub in? I've never seen an ORIF before.
Meredith : Can't. The board's all backed up like crazy.
UNK: Will's going to have to wait,
Callie : because every specialty thinks their surgeries are more important than Ortho.
Callie : Freaking superior macho jerks.
Meredith : Can I ask you a question? About bone cancer.
Burke : Yeah.
Meredith : - In a dog. - A dog?
Meredith : My dog. Well, Derek's dog. Do you know Dr. Shepherd?
Meredith : It's our dog. We share the dog, which is... well, never mind.
UNK: I wanted to ask if you knew the success rate
Meredith : of curing osteosarcoma in a canine leg?
Callie : We have an actual human patient with a bullet lodged in his tibia
Callie : who might walk with a limp for the rest of his life, or even lose his leg,
Callie : and you're asking me about your precious dog
Callie : that you share with your precious McDreamy? Yeah, I... I know about him.
Callie : And you think I care?
Callie : Unbelievable!
UNK: Your guy's on an LVAD.
UNK: He'll be up and walking around. My guy still needs his dobutamine drip.
Burke : That's the best you can do?
UNK: He could climb Mount Shasta on a dobutamine drip.
UNK: This morning, Dr. Hahn's patient was 22 hundreds of a point ahead.
Burke : That's basically a tie.
UNK: Dr. Hahn's patient was admitted into the transplant program before Mr. Duquette.
Burke : How long before?
UNK: 17 seconds.
UNK: Man on Phone : 17 seconds.
Erica : Might as well be 17 weeks.
Alex : - Hello? - Alex? Where's Dr. Burke?
UNK: - What do you want? - How the heart recovery is going.
Alex : He's working on it.
UNK: He's working on it? So, he's operating then?
Alex : There were two donors, Izzie.
UNK: Our heart flatlined. He's trying to get the other guy's.
Izzie : - But there's a list. - And the higher guy gets the heart.
Izzie : Denny's getting sicker.
Cristina : What?
Izzie : Denny's getting worse by the second. His, uh, sats are in the eighties.
Denny : - Izzie. - It's seventies.
Izzie : His sats are now in the seventies and dropping.
Alex : - Izzie, I'm not going to lie for you. - Then put Burke on the phone!
Izzie : Hey.
Izzie : - Hey. - Have you seen Dr. Karev?
UNK: Uh... hours ago.
Cristina : OK.
UNK: Sorry. I, uh... I'm not sorry.
UNK: I just... I'm having a little trouble because I need to ask you something.
Addison : And I don't usually have trouble. But what I need to ask...
Addison : I'm not even sure I want the answer to, but I have to ask.
Addison : So I'm just going to ask you and then you answer and then...
Addison : I'll go from there, OK?
Cristina : OK.
Addison : Are you sleeping with my husband?
Meredith : Not since before I knew he was married.
Cristina : OK.
UNK: Except, you know, it just... it felt like in the vet's office this morning,
Addison : and then again in the elevator...
UNK: it felt a little like you two were having a lover's quarrel?
Meredith : No. We're not.
Meredith : I've moved on. I'm dating Finn.
Addison : You're dating the vet?
Cristina : - OK. - Addison...
UNK: No, no. Thanks. I'm... I'm good.
Addison : Thanks. I'm great.
UNK: Flash pulmonary edema?
UNK: Is it the LVAD? Is the LVAD working?
Izzie : - Absolutely. - Did you put him on a nitro drip?
Izzie : Um, yes. Yes, of course.
Erica : Preston, she could be putting paddles directly on his heart.
UNK: - He's not getting it. - Blood pressure?
Izzie : It's, uh, still dropping. 82 over 40.
