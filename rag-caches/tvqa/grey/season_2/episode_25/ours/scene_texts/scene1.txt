Neal : I said I was sorry.
Deborah : The shooting starts, you duck behind me and you're sorry?
Cristina : - You ducked behind her? - It was instinct.
Neal : I couldn't help it. Deb, honey, you know I love you.
Deborah : Love means never having to use your girlfriend as a human shield!
Neal : We shared a bullet, Deborah. It went through you and into me!
Neal : That's a sign we should be together forever. A sign.
Deborah : No, Neal, this is a sign! She's squirting water through my arm.
UNK: Look. I can see you through my arm. That's another sign!

Izzie : Excuse me?
Brad : I'm a quick thinker. Smart. Always right on it.
Brad : As soon as I saw him, Petey... he's the shooter...
Brad : I knew when I fired him he was no good.
Brad : Soon as I saw him, I thought, "Oh, here we go. "

Izzie : They have gunshot wounds. Very serious gunshot wounds.
Izzie : Life threatening gunshot wounds.
Brad : Really helps that I'm an athlete because the second I saw Petey with that gun,
