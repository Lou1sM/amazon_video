Izzie : So it's true? He's getting a heart then?
Bailey : See, your face right now?
Bailey : That's the problem. You're overly attached to your patient.
Bailey : So the answer is no, you cannot prep him. Go back to sutures.
Izzie : I know Denny's cardiac parameters.
Izzie : I know how his LVAD works better than any other intern.
UNK: I know his meds better.
Izzie : I know the frequency, the dosage, the quantity, and his physical limitations.
Izzie : I promise I will... I will be 100% professional.
Bailey : No flirting, no knitting him sweaters, no marathon games of Scrabble?
Izzie : I will treat him with the same protocol I would any other patient.
Bailey : All right. Fine. You can inform him the heart's coming.
Izzie : - Thank you, Dr. Bailey. - If you so much as sit on that bed...
UNK: I got it!
Derek : Can you imagine? You're at work, you're doing your job
Derek : and somebody comes in and shoots you. Just... puts a bullet in your head.
Derek : - 19 years old. - Her parents are on their way. Also...
Derek : We need to get her into the OR immediately.
UNK: - The bullet's gone through the midline. - Also, uh...
Derek : Look at the size of the hematoma. Also?
Cristina : - What? - You said "also" twice.
George : Yeah. Also, she's pregnant.
Brad : Hey, I'm management, so I'm 100% covered.
Brad : So I could spend a year in this hospital, wouldn't cost me a cent.
Brad : When I told you about management, you should've listened.
Brad : Because now you're screwed.
Brad : Even if you just spend one day in this ER, that's three months' rent.
UNK: You want to be 16-year-old...
UNK: Other Man : Is there any chance you can, please, up my morphine?
Meredith : He keeps talking, pretty soon I'm going to need some.
Will : Can you find out about Kendra for me?
Meredith : Are you two friends?
Will : Not friends, exactly. But, uh, everybody likes her.
Neal : You know, she's... she's just... she's nice.
Will : She'll cover your shift when you need it. She's good with customers.
Will : She's real generous when it comes to tipping busboys.
Meredith : - Let me guess. You're a busboy? - I am.
Will : Plus, she's the only one that calls Brad on his crap.
Meredith : Well, why don't you say something?
Will : Yeah, I wish.
Will : I'm saving up to go back to school. I need the job.
Callie : What are you, socializing?
Callie : I've got five more patients for you to see and Will needs to get to surgery.
Callie : Move your ass.
Will : I need the job.
Izzie : - I have some news for you. - Am I getting a better television?
Denny : Because this one is ridiculously small and it doesn't get the porny channels.
Izzie : You're getting a heart, Denny.
Denny : I don't mean to be dramatic and all...
Denny : but I'm going to need you to repeat that.
Denny : And you say it slow, because this is one of those moments in life
Denny : that I'm going to want to remember in detail.
UNK: You... are getting a heart...
Izzie : from Mercy West. Dr. Burke already left to get it.
Denny : I guess this means I'm going to have to start taking you on some real dates.
Izzie : I guess so.
Patricia : Here we are, Mr. Duquette.
UNK: - What are these? - DNR papers.
Izzie : Do not resuscitate?
Patricia : I'll leave these here and come back.
UNK: Why are you signing these? You're getting a heart.
Denny : - If this heart doesn't come through... - It will.
Denny : - The last one didn't. - You're on an LVAD.
Izzie : That could give you another two years right there.
UNK: Izzie... if I don't get this heart... I'm done.
UNK: I'm... I'm sorry... I'm tired.
Izzie : No. No. I'm not going to let you make this decision. Not now.
Denny : Well, that's funny because I thought DNR was a patient's choice.
Denny : Listen to me.
Denny : I believe in heaven, Izzie.
Denny : And if I had to choose between this life here...
Denny : and one in heaven...
Denny : I choose heaven. OK?
Cristina : OK.
