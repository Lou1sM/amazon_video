Alex : Dr. Burke!
Alex : I heard you were getting a heart. Can I go with you?
Cristina : I asked first.
Burke : You didn't get assigned to any gunshot cases?
Cristina : Well, yeah, but if you had put me on this when I asked I would've been free.
Alex : - I didn't. - He's on the gynie squad!
Alex : Not if you put me on this transplant.
Alex : Please.
Burke : - Let's go, Karev. - You can't be serious!
Alex : Whoo! See you later, Yang. Whoo!
