Rose : That look he has on his face,
Rose : that's how my husband would look at me if he knew about any of this.
Rose : And I can't have my husband look at me like that.
Rose : And I can't have any more babies.
Izzie : For the record? I am on your side today. George sucks.
Cristina : Hmm. Burke doesn't think so. He's his new best friend.
Izzie : I wonder if Burke knows where he lives.
Izzie : How's Denny doing? Bailey's not caving in on the LVAD thing, is she?
Cristina : About that...
Meredith : I thought Alex was kidding when he said you dumped him for a heart patient.
UNK: - Did you dump him for a patient? - Of course not.
Meredith : Because Denny's a patient. We can't fall for our patients.
Cristina : You're falling for a vet.
Meredith : I'm considering the possibility of maybe having a date with a vet.
Cristina : That's all I'm saying.
Meredith : My point is, Bailey's on the warpath about you and Denny. So just be careful.
Addison : How's the sponge count, Dr. Karev?
UNK: They're all accounted for, but I see a bleeder here.
Addison : It's small. Get the Bovie and cauterize it.
Alex : - I got it. - That's good.
Addison : Uh, there's a little bleeding near the tube here.
Addison : Can you hand me the Bovie, Dr. Karev?
Alex : I don't see any abnormal bleeding.
Addison : Are you the surgeon here?
MVO : - No. - Then give me the Bovie.
Addison : Give me the Bovie, Dr. Karev.
Addison : Hey there, Joseph. Welcome to the world.
Addison : Rose, before we bring your family in to see you,
Addison : I wanted to let you know that there was a complication with your surgery.
Addison : We had some unexpected bleeding that caused damage to both fallopian tubes.
Rose : So you're saying?
Addison : You won't be able to have any more children.
Rose : Thank you, Dr. Shepherd.
UNK: As I said, it was... a complication.
Rose : I understand.
Alex : A complication? That's what you're calling it?
Addison : That's what it was.
Alex : One of the most bizarre obstetric complications ever.
Addison : She is our patient. Our obligation is to her and her only.
Derek : - Hey. - Well, hey.
Meredith : - Uh, you picked up Doc? - Yeah. He's home.
Meredith : - He seems to be doing much better. - He seems to be doing good.
Meredith : - I'm not laughing at you. - No.
Meredith : No, it's just, you know, bad sex isn't really something
Meredith : that wives want announced to the dirty ex-mistress.
Derek : You're not the dirty ex-mistress. She's your friend. I'm your friend.
UNK: We're all... friends.
Meredith : But you didn't tell her.
MVO : No.
Derek : How's your day going?
Derek : - Great. - Good.
Meredith : The vet asked me if we...
Derek : - What? What did he ask you? - If we were together.
George : - Uh-huh. - And I set him straight.
