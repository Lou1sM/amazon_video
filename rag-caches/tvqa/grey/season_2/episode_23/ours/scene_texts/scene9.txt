UNK: - I should've called. I was going to... - No, no.
UNK: Uh... don't call. Never call. Always show up.
Finn : - OK. - OK.
Finn : But I can't tonight. I've got an errand I have to run.
Meredith : I run errands.
UNK: This shouldn't take long. We can grab dinner after.
Meredith : - After? - After she gives birth.
Meredith : - We're birthing a horse? - Yeah.
Meredith : That was your errand? You're birthing a horse?
Finn : Yeah. I guess I could've mentioned it before.
UNK: But I didn't want to scare you back to your knitting.
Finn : She's getting anxious. You can wait back here.
Meredith : - Back here? - If you want. It gets a little messy.
Meredith : Are you kidding? I want to birth a horse.
Addison : Richard, we have to talk about Alex Karev.
Addison : I know he's talented, but his attitude, in my opinion,
Addison : has reached an unacceptable low.
Richard : Addison.
Richard : You've got a bigger problem today than Alex Karev.
Richard : Mr. Ward has been speaking with our attorney regarding his wife's surgery.
Richard : Now I read your chart. I read the nurse's notes.
Richard : Now, can you explain to me what kind of complication from a C-section
Richard : leads to the severing of both fallopian tubes?
Derek : Well, the bad news is... you had a grand mal seizure.
Derek : The good news is we mapped it, so now we can operate.
UNK: Mrs. Graber : No. I've decided against surgery, Dr. Shepherd.
UNK: - I'm sorry? - No offense.
UNK: The risks of craniotomy... when you explained, they're not very appealing.
Derek : Yes, there are risks.
Derek : But you have to weigh those risks
UNK: with the detrimental effect your seizures have on your life.
UNK: Unless my life is having a detrimental effect on my seizure disorder.
UNK: With you and your wife : Is the bad sex your big problem
UNK: or are all the bigger problems causing the bad sex?
UNK: I'm, uh... I'm not going to answer that.
UNK: Ms. Graber : All right, my point is, I had more fun today than I can remember.
UNK: I don't have any friends. I don't have any fun. I only have work.
UNK: Ms. Graber : Work and seizures.
UNK: Ms. Graber : It's no coincidence that when the work stopped, the seizures stopped.
UNK: Ms. Graber : - Until these two started arguing. - I'll talk to them about that.
UNK: Ms. Graber : No, you don't get it. Watching people fight... Oh.
UNK: Ms. Graber : It's been my whole life for 15 years. So, I'm changing my life.
UNK: Ms. Graber : If that doesn't work, I'll come back here and let you cut open my brain, OK?
Derek : All right. Fair enough.
Finn : - It's pretty good, huh? - Yeah, it's pretty good.
UNK: - How're you feeling? - A little sore.
Addison : Oh, that's to be expected.
Rose : I'm sorry I told Chris about the complication.
UNK: I just... I just thought he should know that Joseph would be our last.
Rose : So he could savor it.
Rose : I didn't know he was going to do this.
Addison : Rose.
Addison : I need you to tell him that you asked me to tie your tubes.
Rose : For you, it's just insurance.
Rose : And you don't even have to pay. For me, it's my marriage. It's my family.
Addison : It's my career, Rose. It's my reputation.
Rose : You're the best. People come from all over the country to see you.
Rose : That won't change.
Rose : I can't tell him.
UNK: Dr. Shepherd... I'm so sorry
Rose : because I am so grateful to you.
Rose : But I can't tell him.
Finn : Is it coming off?
Meredith : Not exactly.
Rose : - I'm sorry. - Oh, don't be. It was a great date.
Finn : Technically it wasn't the date. It was the errand.
UNK: Now... we could go up to my place. I could cook for you.
Meredith : Go up to your place?
Finn : Well, do you want to come up to my place?
Meredith : Yeah. I mean, no.
UNK: No, I don't. I... I do. But I don't.
Finn : - You don't know? - No, I do. I mean, I... I know.
Meredith : No, I don't.
Finn : All right, well, here's the deal. Um... you have two options.
Finn : You could come up to my place, take off all your clothes,
UNK: shower off the goo, borrow a shirt, and I'll cook dinner.
Finn : That's door number one. Door number two... you go home.
Finn : I think you ought to take door one. It involves you naked in my apartment.
UNK: But, you know... that's just me.
