Izzie : Make her seize? How do we make someone have a seizure?
Derek : Get creative.
George : If all the normal methods have failed, then... what are we supposed to do?
Derek : Use a strobe light. Get her drunk.
Derek : Hang her from the ceiling and hit her with a Wiffle Ball bat.
Izzie : Make her seize. I don't know where to operate.
UNK: That means I can't get her out of my life.
Derek : And this woman is not how I like to start my mornings.
Izzie : I'm just curious, George. Curious George.
Izzie : Get it?
Izzie : Never mind. All I'm asking is where you live.
UNK: There's an old-school arcade game that's been known to induce seizures
George : if you reach level 53.
Izzie : Our divorce lawyer is so not playing an arcade game for 53 levels.
Izzie : Oh, George, by the way, um, where do you live?
George : I'm busy doctoring, Dr. Stevens. No time for chitchat.
Callie : Morning, Dr. O'Malley.
UNK: Uh... morning, Dr. Torres.
Callie : Hmm. So, guess what.
George : Yes.
Callie : Dr. O'Malley, how's all the doctoring going?
Eugene : You tell me.
Burke : It's an honor to hear you play.
UNK: Too good a man to lie.
UNK: I'll read your mind : His timing is off. His rhythm is off.
UNK: This man has no business calling himself Eugene Foote.
Burke : You understand, sir, that in the months since the initial surgery,
Burke : scar tissue has formed around the pacemaker.
Burke : Removing it is not nearly as simple as it sounds.
Eugene : I picked up the violin at six years old.
Eugene : It was in my grandfather's attic.
Eugene : I didn't even know what it was.
Eugene : But I remember picking it up.
MVO : That moment.
Eugene : I remember putting the bow to the strings and pulling.
Meredith : Just that.
Eugene : Just that screechy little chirp.
Eugene : And that was it. I was hooked.
Eugene : You remember a moment like that in your life?
Eugene : I know this surgery could kill me.
Eugene : I also know you're the best,
Eugene : which makes you my best shot of survival.
Eugene : I'd like you to be the one to operate, Dr. Burke.
Eugene : But if you won't, I'll find someone who will.
Burke : He's right.
Cristina : What? He can't play?
Burke : He can't play like Eugene Foote.
Cristina : OK. So, uh, surgery?
Burke : He says he will go somewhere else if I refuse. I might let him.
Cristina : Why?
Cristina : Oh, you can't let him go somewhere else. What are you?
Cristina : OK, what if it were you?
Cristina : What if you couldn't be a surgeon anymore?
UNK: Or... Or you could still be one, but... but not a great one.
Cristina : Just average. He can get his surgery somewhere else.
Cristina : But that surgeon might be average.
Meredith : EKG, ECHO, and nuclear all within normal limits.
Bailey : Denny, in that case, I see no reason why you can't be up walking.
Denny : - Music to my ears, Dr. Bailey. - Good. So, you have any questions?
Derek : - No. It's... - We can put it off.
Bailey : No harm in waiting a few weeks if you have questions. If you're worried.
