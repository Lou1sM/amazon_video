Alex : Do I look like a chick to you?
Alex : Do I look like I care about yeast cream or tingling feelings?
Alex : I mean, he's not in jail or on drugs or keeping body parts in his basement.
Alex : - You want to do him, do him. - Not do him. Date him.
Meredith : I'm not doing anybody. I'm knitting.
Cristina : I need Eugene Foote's chart. Oh! Who are we talking about?
Meredith : It's weird, right? I mean, he's Derek's vet. He's Doc's vet.
Meredith : He's my vet. He's McVet. It's weird to date him, right?
Cristina : - Wait, did you say vet? - Mm-hmm.
Cristina : Like animals? Oh, you can't date a vet. He's not even a real doctor.
Addison : Damn it!
UNK: Sex. Hot sex. Need that! Ha-ha, very funny.
UNK: - Mustn't have gone well this morning. - What?
Meredith : Just run if she looks at you.
Addison : I need an intern. Now.
Meredith : - I'm with Bailey. - I'm with Burke.
Addison : Karev.
UNK: I don't do vagina. Not as a doctor anyway.
Addison : Oh. Back talk. You know what? You just bought yourself a case.
UNK: - How are you feeling today, Denny? - Great.
Denny : Be even greater if you'd get me off this machine.
Bailey : Denny, you know I would, but then your heart would stop beating,
Bailey : and Dr. Burke would yell at me and that'd be a bad day for both of us.
Meredith : Is he a candidate for the portable LVAD?
Denny : Now, see? That's what I'm talking about. Half the size, twice the fun.
UNK: - You been doing your research, huh? - I have.
Izzie : I've already told him, he's not ready for it yet.
Bailey : Dr. Stevens, didn't I assign you to neuro this morning?
UNK: Yeah. I was... I'm on my way. But could you tell him about the complications?
Meredith : You'd be risking air embolus, v-fib.
Izzie : The tubing could kink inside your body,
UNK: and we'd have to rush you to emergency surgery.
Bailey : Dr. Stevens, unless Mr. Duquette's heart has suddenly grown a brain,
Bailey : - you are currently not doing your job. - I'm going.
Izzie : - Just don't be stupid, OK? - You're not the boss of me now, woman.
Eugene : - I want you to take it out. - Take it out?
UNK: But your heart function has improved exponentially since we put it in.
Burke : - The setting is working well. - You know my music, Dr. Burke.
Burke : Very well, sir. Changed my life.
Eugene : Well, your contraption has changed my heartbeat.
Eugene : It changed my rhythm. I can't play.
Eugene : And that's a sacrifice I am unwilling to make.
Cristina : But you'd be willing to sacrifice your life for your music?
Eugene : They're one and the same.
Burke : Before we do anything drastic,
Burke : just let me try one more setting on the pacemaker.
Burke : Listen, one more setting, Mr. Foote.
