Derek : - Good day, Meredith. - You too, Derek.
UNK: I'm not drinking another espresso. I can't.
George : You can. You're the best divorce attorney in Seattle.
Eugene : - The best. - You can kick that espresso's ass.
Izzie : - Kick it. - Kick it.
UNK: Kick it. Kick. Yeah!
UNK: Ms. Graber : Whoa, whoa, whoa.
UNK: Ms. Graber : OK, good. So, caffeine's for seizures. What's the doughnuts for?
Izzie : To absorb some of the coffee so it doesn't burn a hole in your stomach.
UNK: Ms. Graber : Good. OK, good idea.
UNK: Ms. Graber : Mm. Oh. Do you know how long it has been since I have had a doughnut?
UNK: Ms. Graber : I really, really, really, really, really like doughnuts.
George : Why don't you eat them?
UNK: Ms. Graber : Got to stay on top of my game. No time for exercise. No carbs. No sugar.
UNK: Ms. Graber : Can't have a sugar crash in court. You know, stupid court!
UNK: Ms. Graber : Court is stupid because I love doughnuts!
Izzie : You're making really good progress.
Denny : Hey there, Chief. You here for my big moment?
Richard : Yeah, I'm looking forward to it, Denny.
Bailey : Is there something I can do for you, Chief?
Richard : - His EKG? - Normal.
Bailey : - As well as his ECHO and nuclear study. - Mm-hmm. His perfusion?
Bailey : He's ready, Chief.
Richard : Well, looking good. Carry on.
Bailey : Thank you, sir.
UNK: Ms. Graber : Die! Die! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Next level. I'm at the next level.
UNK: Ms. Graber : - God, this is exhilarating! - Good. Keep going.
UNK: Only 12 more levels before you reach prime seizure potential.
Izzie : This is fun. Yeah, right? You know?
Izzie : Like fun that we had at home back when you used to tell me things.
Izzie : - Like where you live? - Don't start that again.
Izzie : I'm just saying, there's fun to be had.
Izzie : All the time with me. Your best friend.
George : It's not like we're in high school.
Izzie : Don't do the whispering under your breath thing.
UNK: - If you got something to say, say it. - Last time you said that it went well.
UNK: You're pissed at me because of what happened with Meredith?
George : No. Yeah.
Burke : Oh. He recorded this at the Hollywood Bowl a couple years ago.
Cristina : It's nice.
Burke : It's not nice. It's brilliant.
UNK: Mr. Ward : Excuse me. You were one of my wife's doctors, weren't you? Rose Ward?
Alex : Yes, I was.
UNK: Mr. Ward : She just told me there was a complication with her C-section.
Izzie : I told you to tell her how you feel, not to jump into bed with her.
George : - Whatever you told me. - Adultery.
George : Why did you send me in there? Was it to humiliate me?
George : If you knew she didn't love me. What kind of friend does that?
UNK: It's just... It was shocking.
UNK: Mr. Ward : Someone says there's a complication and everything changes.
UNK: I... can't... breathe.
Richard : - Are all those batteries... - Yes, they're charged. I checked them.
Meredith : - He's having runs of V-tach. - Could be an air embolism.
