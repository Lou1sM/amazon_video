Finn : - Everything OK? - Yeah. Everything's great.
Meredith : Hey, Doc. You look good. He looks good.
Finn : It may just be a virus. But I'd like to wait for the blood tests to be sure.
Meredith : So he can go home today? Derek says he can pick him up.
Meredith : - He can go home. - You hear that, Doc? You can go home.
UNK: So you and Derek, uh... you're together?
Finn : Uh...
Meredith : Uh, Derek and I are, um, just friends.
Meredith : He's married and I'm knitting a sweater.
Meredith : And, uh, well, I guess I'm rambling, which I tend to do a lot of lately,
Meredith : and I wish somebody would just tell me to shut up.
UNK: But my point is... yeah, we're... uh...
Meredith : He's married and I'm knitting a sweater.
Finn : - So you're single? - Single.
Finn : I ask because I was wondering if you'd like to go out with me.
Meredith : - Out. With you. - On a date. Tonight.
Finn : A date. Tonight.
Finn : And you're repeating everything I say so that you can buy yourself some time
Finn : and figure out how a way to let me down easy. It's OK. I get it.
UNK: No. No. I... I... um...
Meredith : you know, you're very... It's just that if I were, you would...
Meredith : Not dating.
UNK: Then there are the sacrifices that you can't even figure out why you're making.
Bailey : Another day, and once again I don't see my name on the board.
Bailey : Chief, any reason my name isn't on the board?
Richard : Slow day.
Bailey : He just patted me on the back.
Bailey : Tell me, when did I become a person who gets patted on the back?
Burke : You think he's mommy tracking you?
UNK: What... What have you heard?
Burke : How about you handle Denny Duquette for me today?
Bailey : Absolutely. Thank you, Dr. Burke.
Cristina : - I brought you a coffee. - Oh, thanks. Uh, very thoughtful.
Cristina : - What? - Nothing. I'm just dragging a little.
Burke : Only did two miles this morning. O'Malley and I were up to six.
Cristina : - Oh, you're missing George. - No. No, of course not.
Cristina : - Drink your coffee. - No, that's all right.
Burke : - Actually... - Cappuccino!
UNK: Hey, O'Malley!
George : Big news. Eugene Foote is here. He's having problems with his pacemaker.
Burke : - Here? What? In this hospital? - Uh-huh.
Cristina : Who's Eugene Foote?
George : Genius violinist? Burke's hero?
George : Burke flew down to San Francisco to put in his pacemaker.
UNK: - Burke has 40 of his albums. - No. Um, 42.
UNK: No, 43. You just got the greatest hits. The one with the DVD.
Burke : - Oh! Right. You want in on Foote? - Yes.
George : But, uh, I'm on neuro today with Dr. Shepherd.
UNK: I want in! Hello! I want in!
Burke : Hmm? Oh. Sure. Yeah, right.
Cristina : Burke? Um, I laid on top of you naked last night.
Cristina : So why don't you wax nostalgic about that?
Meredith : Obviously, I can't go out with him, right?
