UNK: but it doesn't hurt much. I'm telling you, I can handle this.
UNK: Here's what I'm thinking : we put a splint on my finger
Heath : so I can jam it into the glove, play today and I'm all yours.
UNK: - You are not playing today! - Heath, your mom is right.
Izzie : Thank you. Did you hear that? I'm right.
UNK: - Your mother must be proud. - Scouts are coming, college scouts.
Heath : I could get a scholarship today!
Callie : If I cut that bandage off we risk permanent damage to your finger.
UNK: I'm with you, but I'm sorry.
Callie : There's no way we can put your finger into a glove today.
Heath : There must be something you can do. I need to play this afternoon.
UNK: This game is what I've been training for my entire life.
Heath : This is my chance to go to college, it's my whole future.
UNK: Mrs. Mercer : Honey, you can go to community college.
UNK: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
UNK: - Ooh. That sucks. - Yeah.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : Oh, Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.
UNK: - Are those my wife's test results? - Yes, they are actually.
Addison : There's no infection.
Addison : I'm scheduling a C-section this afternoon.
Addison : I was actually going to go up after lunch and tell her.
Addison : - Mr. Gibson... - You do look like Catherine Deneuve.
UNK: I'm talking to you about your wife...
Addison : - giving birth to your baby. - I know.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : I'm sorry. May I?
UNK: Mr. Gibson : Listen, I don't mean to focus on your looks.
UNK: You seem very kind, intelligent. You're a doctor.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : I don't mean to objectify or harass you in any way.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : I'm usually not this awkward, but...
UNK: Mr. Gibson : you're just so extraordinarily beautiful.
UNK: I understand if a woman like you doesn't want to eat with me.
UNK: So, uh... Well, anyway.
Sylvia : No, no.
Izzie : - Really? - Yes, stay. It's fine.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : All right.
UNK: You going to eat that pudding?
Richard : - Take him. - Bailey gave him to you.
UNK: She's only in surgery for another half hour, hour tops.
Richard : - Take him. - You're a liar and you smell of vomit.
UNK: Really? Because I think she smells like poo.
Cristina : This is why some species eat their young.
UNK: - Have you talked to Meredith yet? - Tomorrow I am going to buy a T-shirt
George : that says, "Stop asking me about Meredith".
UNK: I'm going to wear it every day until people stop asking me.
Cristina : At least they won't be asking you about your hair.
UNK: Oh, come on. Meredith, stop him.
Meredith : What should I do? Knock him down?
UNK: Do you know he cut his hair over my bathroom sink today?
Meredith : George is a good roommate. You can tell him what's annoying you.
UNK: No, he's not my room... This is why I shouldn't have given up my place.
Izzie : He would still be our roommate if Meredith would apologize.
Meredith : I have apologized. I've apologized sincerely.
