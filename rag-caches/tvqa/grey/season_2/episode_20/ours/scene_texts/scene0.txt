Burke : that's his business, his thing.
UNK: It's my thing. Coffee?
Burke : Oh, cappuccino.
George : Ooh, excellent. Cappuccino.
UNK: We're supposed to forget the past that landed us here,
UNK: ignore the future complications that might arise,
UNK: and go for the quick fix.
UNK: - Is George having a nervous breakdown? - Burke says he's got issues.
UNK: You should see them, like, doing things.
UNK: Like running and... cooking and talking. They're like bonding.
UNK: And you're afraid Burke will realize he makes a better girlfriend than you?
Cristina : You know, just go and apologize to him.
Meredith : - I've tried. - Try again.
Izzie : Things can't stay like this. They suck like this.
UNK: What's with O'Malley's hair? He looks like a hobbit.
Izzie : - He's just trying a new look. - You didn't call back. You avoiding me?
Izzie : Why would I be avoiding you?
UNK: Denny Duquette, aged 36.
UNK: 37 in three weeks.
UNK: 37 in three weeks. Has difficulty breathing and chest pains.
Burke : - Breath sounds? - A little junky.
UNK: He has a build-up of fluid.
UNK: Did you just call me a junky? That's not very nice.
UNK: Denny, your congestive heart failure is getting worse despite the meds.
UNK: All right. So how do we proceed?
Burke : Doctors, how do we proceed?
Alex : Titrate up his nitrate drip, then diuretics.
UNK: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and start dobutamine.
UNK: I want his ins and outs recorded and one of you monitoring him at all times.
UNK: Izzie immediately puts up her hand : - I'll stay. - Me, too.
Addison : Mr. and Mrs. Gibson, Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.
UNK: I'll be covering for Dr. Pollack.
Meredith : Mrs. Gibson had a preterm, premature rupture of her membranes at 28 weeks.
UNK: She's confined to bed rest for seven weeks and has a low-grade fever.
UNK: Mrs. Gibson : Can't you just schedule a C?
UNK: Believe me, I am ready to have this baby.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : You and me both.
Addison : I want to get your blood work before we make any further decisions.
UNK: Mrs. Gibson : I have to pee. Again.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : Come on. Here we go.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : I appreciate you taking over my wife's case.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : - Dr. Pollack says you're the best. - It's my pleasure, Mr. Gibson.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : He didn't mention that...
UNK: I mean, you bear a striking resemblance to a young Catherine Deneuve.
UNK: Oh, you never heard that before?
UNK: Eh, no. I'm sorry.
Addison : - I have to say, it's a first. - Been told I look like Halle Berry.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : Beautiful. Beautiful. Well, Ms. Deneuve.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : Of course, you are, too, but by extension.
UNK: Right. We'll be back in later to check on your wife.
UNK: Mr. Gibson : Look forward to it.
Bailey : - ER needs a consult. - O'Malley, Grey, you go take that.
Meredith : - What about Mrs. Gibson? - I'll take care of her.
UNK: - Uh, do they really need both of us? - I guess you'll find out. Go.
Addison : - Are you taking him to the nursery? - It's full and Tucker's out of town.
