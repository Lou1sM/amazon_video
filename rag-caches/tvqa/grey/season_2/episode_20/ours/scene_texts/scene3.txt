Sylvia : - Honey. - Huh?
UNK: - Talk to me. Distract me. - OK. Think about Paris, huh?
Kyle : - And the food and the wine. - Uh-huh.
Kyle : And the long walks we'll take together. And the Champs EI... What?
Addison : - Yeah. - More food, more wine.
Meredith : - OK. - That's it?
Sylvia : Oh, my God, I didn't even feel anything.
UNK: You're amazing. She's amazing.
UNK: Kyle to Meredith : So... how much do you know about this Dr. Shepherd?
UNK: Sylvia warningly : - Kyle, no. - What?
UNK: Sylvia warningly : I do not want another MRI. I want to go to Paris.
Kyle : I made a few calls. He has an incredible reputation.
Sylvia : Please, Kyle. Let's just live our lives.
UNK: I want to go crazy. I want to crawl underneath the table.
UNK: Sylvia warningly : I want to go to Paris while we still can.
UNK: Kyle to Meredith : Dr. Shepherd is an extraordinary surgeon.
Meredith : If he thinks he can help, a second opinion couldn't hurt, could it?
UNK: It won't be a second opinion. It'll be a fourth opinion.
Sylvia : And when Dr. Shepherd says there's nothing more he can do,
Sylvia : we'll be devastated all over again.
UNK: I just want to spend what little time we have left in Paris.
Kyle : So do I. But I don't want to go to Paris and wonder if we should have listened
Kyle : to the amazing girl who took the fork out of your neck.
Denny : - You're not Izzie. - Sorry to disappoint you.
Denny : Not disappointed. Just saying.
Denny : - Where is she? - Oh, she's busy with other patients.
Alex : I'm afraid you'll have to make do with me.
Denny : Look, man, I'm sure you're...
Denny : I'm sure you're a fine doctor. You're just...
UNK: You're just not as much my type. No offense.
Alex : I'll just have to settle on being Izzie's type.
UNK: So you...?
UNK: - You two...? - Yeah, yeah.
Alex : Pretty much. You know.
Denny : Congratulations.
UNK: ~ A, B, C, D...
UNK: Cristina singing : Oh, gross.
UNK: ~ E, F, G
UNK: ~ This really couldn't suck any worse...
UNK: Dr. Yang?
UNK: - Oh, uh, Dr. Webber. - What's that smell?
UNK: Uh, it's feces. It's baby feces. We've had an incident, sir.
Richard : Are you having trouble with the diaper, Yang?
Richard : - It looks like you're having trouble. - No, sir.
UNK: I've got an MD from... Stanford and a PhD from Berkeley.
Cristina : I can handle this diaper. Unless you want to.
UNK: Uh... no.
UNK: It's all right, it's all right.
UNK: Richard uncomfortable : You carry on.
UNK: Richard uncomfortable : Carry on.
Sylvia : - Can we stop for a moment, please? - Sure.
Sylvia : I can walk.
UNK: - OK. The wheelchair is just protocol. - Yeah, well...
Sylvia : I'm way past caring about protocol.
UNK: I just want to feel my body move while I can.
Meredith : You seem incredibly OK with your prognosis.
UNK: I'm more than OK. I'm a little in love with my prognosis.
UNK: It woke me up. It woke my marriage up.
UNK: I've been sleepwalking about 15 years. And now... I am wide awake.
UNK: Sylvia nods : I'm having this MRI for Kyle. He's not ready to let go.
UNK: But me and my aneurysm? We're good friends.
Addison : - Hey, I've been looking for you. - Hey. Look.
Derek : - Look at the size of this aneurysm. - Oh, it's big.
UNK: - Are you going to operate? - I'm definitely intrigued.
UNK: - Do you know who Catherine Deneuve is? - Um...
Derek : Yeah. Actress. French. Hot.
UNK: One of my patients, her husband, said I looked like her.
UNK: Isn't she blond?
UNK: Yeah, I... guess. I don't know.
Meredith : I don't know.
