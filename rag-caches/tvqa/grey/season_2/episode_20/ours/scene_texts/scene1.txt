Richard : - You brought your baby to work? - Uh, yes, Chief.
UNK: You're not taking him into surgery.
Bailey : - I don't have anything scheduled. - Yet.
Bailey : I can't solve a problem until there's one to solve.
Bailey : - Are you saying there's a problem? - Is there a problem, Richard?
MVO : No.
Meredith : You know, at some point you are going to have to talk to me.
UNK: I'm going to take the stairs.
Meredith : - You paged? - Just got a new patient.
Doctor : Looks surgical, maybe neuro.
Meredith : Doesn't look neuro to me.
Doctor : - Not him. - Oh no, I'm fine. It's my wife.
Sylvia : This is so embarrassing, but we didn't know what else to do.
Kyle : We were at the Hotel Monaco having brunch. We had some mimosas.
UNK: Can we skip that part?
UNK: Can we pull this out and just go? I'm fine, really.
Kyle : Sylvia was giving me some special attention.
Kyle : - Under the table. - Dear Lord.
Derek : Oh! OK.
Kyle : Sweetie, they're doctors. They've heard it all.
Meredith : - Absolutely. - While I was down there
Sylvia : it was like a shock went through my body.
Kyle : - And she... clenched. - Clenched?
Sylvia : - My jaw. It just shut. - Oh, and I panicked.
UNK: I grabbed the fork off the table and it was just instinctual.
Sylvia : It doesn't hurt that much.
Sylvia : We just didn't want to pull it out. It's in pretty good.
Meredith : No, you did the right thing. Pulling it out could cause more damage.
UNK: I want to do an X-ray to make sure no nerve
Derek : or major blood vessels are being compromised.
UNK: Did you get your injury checked?
UNK: Doctor says I'm fine. It's just bruising.
UNK: I want to find out what caused the clenching.
Derek : - Do you have a history of seizures? - No, nothing like that.
UNK: It may... It may have something to do with her brain aneurysm.
UNK: - Kyle. I don't want to do this now. - It's not on there.
UNK: Can we just take this fork out and go?
MVO : No.
UNK: - She was diagnosed six weeks ago. - Your doctor didn't recommend surgery?
UNK: All the surgeons say it's inoperable.
Sylvia : That's why Kyle and I are here in Seattle.
Sylvia : The Space Needle.
Sylvia : - I've always wanted to see it. - We wanted to see it together.
UNK: Derek softly to Meredith : Do an MRI.
UNK: It's good to see you.
UNK: Bailey yells : - What do we got? - Tachycardic in the 140s.
UNK: Systolic dipped to the 60s. Last was 72 over 40.
