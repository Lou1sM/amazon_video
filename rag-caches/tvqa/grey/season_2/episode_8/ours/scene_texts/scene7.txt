Bailey : we found that there were calcifications.
Derek : What does that mean?
Bailey : It's often a sign of gallbladder cancer. We sent it off to Pathology.
Jed : - She has cancer? - I'm afraid so.
Bailey : We can keep her comfortable,
Bailey : but she's going to need more tests to see what our next steps are.
Bailey : This might include more surgery.
Jed : But this surgery will save her, right?
Bailey : The cancer appears to be advanced.
UNK: There are palliative surgeries we can do.
Bailey : That is, surgeries to help with the pain, but it won't cure it.
UNK: How long has she got?
Bailey : From what we can tell so far, she has about four to six months.
Bailey : I'm so sorry.
Jed : I don't want Esme to know.
Bailey : - What? - Esme.
Jed : - I don't want her to know she's dying. - You don't want to tell her?
Jed : Please. You saw her. She's happy.
Jed : Let me take her home.
Jed : I don't want her to be afraid before she dies. She doesn't need to know.
Stu : No, please don't.
