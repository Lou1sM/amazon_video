UNK: No more carpe diem, man. I don't want to seize the day.
George : That's what I don't get.
George : I'm standing here, and I'm just incredibly happy to be alive.
UNK: I'm looking at the sky, it's bluer, food tastes better,
UNK: and I didn't survive a five-story fall.
UNK: You jumped, didn't you?
Stu : The whole way down, all I could think about was Daisy.
Stu : She's my ex-girl. She works in this hospital.
UNK: What kind of joke is that?
George : Maybe... Maybe you got a second chance.
Stu : Daisy.
UNK: You got to go and find her for me.
UNK: I wanna talk to her.
UNK: Tell her she's the reason I'm alive.
UNK: Weiss upset : We had a future. You know, we had plans.
UNK: Weiss upset : We picked out baby names together.
UNK: Weiss upset : She betrayed that without even asking my opinion.
UNK: Weiss upset : Without even giving me time to process it.
Derek : It's a difficult time for both of you.
Derek : - She's emotional. - And hormone changes, mood swings.
UNK: They say she could lose her sex drive.
Derek : You'll get through this. All right?
Derek : You can do this.
Derek : You guys love each other.
Weiss : Is that what you said about you and Addy?
Bailey : What?
Weiss : - You left her. - That was different.
Weiss : Was it, Derek? Really?
UNK: You know, I got to check on a patient, then get ready for dinner.
Derek : See you later.
Weiss : Sure.
Cristina : Where's the butter?
Cristina : Oh, no, that's olive oil. I want butter.
Waiter : Should I send the sommelier over?
Burke : That won't be necessary. What is a nice, oaky Chardonnay?
Cristina : I want Bordeaux.
UNK: The Chardonnay is better with lobster.
Cristina : I'm having steak.
UNK: You... You eat red meat?
UNK: Cristina equally shocked : You don't?
UNK: You're seriously going to try to find this girl?
Meredith : Hunt her down while she's working?
UNK: Look... OK, I know it's crazy, but someone's got to tell her how he feels.
George : I mean, he's alive, right? Something good has got to come out of this.
George : I mean, this could change everything.
UNK: See, I thought you were a romantic.
Meredith : Was. Past tense.
Derek : Well, this is fun. Again.
UNK: I like the Hello Kitty, by the way. Very pink. Very cheerful.
UNK: Daisy works in Billing. Which is where?
UNK: Derek and Meredith : In the basement.
Bailey : You need something, Chief? I have one more surgery and then I'm free.
Richard : - No, no, no. - OK.
Richard : - Have you made a decision yet? - Sir?
Richard : The fellowship. The Seattle Grace fellowship.
UNK: - I thought you'd have accepted. - I haven't had a chance...
UNK: Richard interrupts : We're a private hospital with extensive resources.
UNK: Richard interrupts : You'll get more surgical experience here.
UNK: Richard interrupts : Write your own ticket. Why aren't you excited?
UNK: No! I'm excited. I... Excuse me, sir, I just need to scrub in. Thanks.
UNK: Dr. Hines to the OR.
