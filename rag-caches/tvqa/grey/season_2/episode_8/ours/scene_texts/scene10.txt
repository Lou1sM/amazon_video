UNK: Alex teasing : I'd look at you in a skirt. Short. Maybe something schoolgirl? Pleated.
Izzie : If that skirt didn't have a pair of big boobs attached, you'd stop looking.
UNK: When you cut 'em off, you build 'em back up.
Alex : Maybe you get to upgrade. Life goes on.
UNK: If there was a test for testicular cancer,
UNK: Izzie whispers angrily : you think men who tested positive would have surgery?
UNK: Izzie whispers angrily : No. You know why? It's castration.
UNK: Izzie whispers angrily : What man would willingly get rid of the part of his anatomy
UNK: Izzie whispers angrily : that makes him a man?
UNK: Izzie whispers angrily : This woman is having herself castrated.
UNK: Izzie whispers angrily : And we book an OR and act like it means nothing. It's not nothing.
UNK: God, how can you possibly act like it's no big deal? I mean, what if it was me?
UNK: Izzie. You're making... Freaking out... You know that, right?
UNK: If I was the one with the cancer gene,
UNK: if tomorrow my boobs were made of plastic
UNK: and my skin had aged ten years and my sex drive had dried up,
Izzie : if it was me, Alex, would you be so fine with it then?
UNK: Yeah, you'd be really hot to kiss me with tongue then, wouldn't you?
Anesthesiologist : Dr. Bailey's scrubbing in, so we're going to get started.
UNK: OK. Hey, George, listen, did you find her?
