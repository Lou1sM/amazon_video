UNK: I'd kind of want to shout it from the rooftops.
George : So to speak.
UNK: It's a miracle. You may not understand the medicine of it.
UNK: A five-story fall, your lungs should be collapsed, your back should be broken.
George : - Your aorta should be totally severed. - George, enough.
UNK: I'm just saying, you know, there's a reason for this.
UNK: You lived. We both did.
UNK: Carpe diem, man. Seize the day.
UNK: - Any chance you can make him leave? - I really, really wish I could.
Bailey : Mr. Vargas, your lower left leg bones are shattered.
UNK: - We'll need to get you in for surgery. - Oh, great. Just my luck.
UNK: Beak!
UNK: Could I... Would you mind, could I keep that?
Savvy : My mother died of it, my aunt. My cousin. She's 37, has ovarian cancer.
Weiss : But you don't. You don't have cancer.
Savvy : But I have the gene.
UNK: Which gives her up to an 85%% chance of getting cancer, Weiss.
UNK: - And a 15%% chance she won't. - I'm not betting my life on 15%%.
UNK: - Were you invited? - Weiss asked me.
Weiss : - I thought it might help. - Help what?
Savvy : I'm sorry, Derek, I'm really glad to see you.
Savvy : But until you grow a uterus and watch your mother die from this,
UNK: - you don't get... you don't get a vote. - Did she say they tried for a baby?
Addison : - She did. - Having a hysterectomy is...
Weiss : - Derek! - We've tried for months.
Weiss : - Why give up now? - Come on, we've talked about this.
Savvy : There are other ways to make a family. We can adopt.
UNK: Weiss interrupts : - Savvy, I just... - No. No! I'm not talking about this.
UNK: Let's just take a step back. All right, take a deep breath and think about this.
Savvy : I've already thought about it, Derek. This... This is going to happen.
UNK: Addison she hands it to Izzie : Dr. Stevens, get a complete history and do her pre-op labs.
UNK: Schedule her for a double-mastectomy and consult Dr. Quenar for a reconstruction.
Weiss : - Derek? - Addison, this conversation isn't over.
Addison : She is my patient, Derek.
UNK: We're doing a bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy and hysterectomy tomorrow.
Addison : Get moving.
Derek : Prophylactic surgery is extreme.
UNK: This has nothing to do with you.
UNK: She came to me for a medical consultation, Derek. I'm her doctor.
Derek : Those are some of our closest friends. This is personal.
UNK: Fine. If it's personal, we should deal with them as a couple.
Addison : - Acting like a couple. - What? What does that mean?
UNK: Addison she holds up her wedding ring on her hand : - See the ring? - Don't go to the ring.
UNK: The ring, Derek. Remember?
UNK: When we're here at work, you won't talk to me.
Addison : Or on the ferry, you pretend not to see me.
UNK: Or in couple's therapy, where we argue about whether we should be in therapy.
Addison : - What are we doing? - It's not about us.
Addison : It is! Medicine aside, our friends are going through hell in there,
Addison : and we can't even act like we like each other long enough to help them.
