UNK: What's that other animal that's monogamous?
UNK: I think it's voles.
UNK: I know it's hard. I'm a pincushion.
UNK: It's OK, don't worry. I won't stick until I find a good one.
UNK: Jed to Meredith : - Otters mate for life, you know. - Excuse me?
UNK: As do voles, I suppose.
UNK: OK, I got it. Hold still, it's going to take a second for the tube to fill.
UNK: I've always liked otters.
Meredith : I've always been more of a dog person myself.
