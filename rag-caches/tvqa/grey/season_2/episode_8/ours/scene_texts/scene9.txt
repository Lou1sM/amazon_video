Bailey : - What? - Oh, nothing.
Cristina : You know, we should probably skip dessert. I have an early morning.
Burke : Oh. Right. Not a problem.
UNK: Help! Is there a doctor in here?
UNK: Cristina & Burke : Yes!
Cristina : Call 911.
UNK: - He said he had heartburn. - Is there a pulse?
Cristina : Yes. It's rapid and unequal.
UNK: - Look. The length of his fingers. - He's got to be at least six-foot-four.
UNK: Burke & Cristina : - Marfan's. - What does that have to do with it?
UNK: He's showing classic markers for Marfan's syndrome.
UNK: - His blood vessel walls are weak. - We need that ambulance.
UNK: - Fast. We need to get him to the OR. - Before his aorta ruptures.
Talia : What are you talking about? Who are you people?
UNK: We have a dissecting thoracic aorta. We need a CT cleared and an OR ready.
UNK: Start another large-bore IV.
UNK: Burke to the paramedics : Continue high flow O2. Transport sirens and lights to Seattle Grace.
Paramedic : - Who the hell are you? - Hey!
Cristina : He's the cardio-thoracic surgeon who'll operate on him.
UNK: Burke looking pleased : And she's with me.
Izzie : Oh, I didn't... Have you been discharged?
Savvy : No. I'm going out to dinner with my surgeon and our husbands.
Savvy : Sort of a last supper, I guess.
Savvy : I know, I know. Nothing after midnight.
Savvy : You're disappointed, aren't you?
Savvy : How do I look?
Izzie : - You're a beautiful woman. - And so are you.
Savvy : Is that why this is so hard to understand?
Savvy : Ugh. Menopause. I know.
UNK: The boobs.
Savvy : But they have hormone replacement, reconstructions.
Savvy : But the sexy Savvy,
Savvy : the Savvy that gets noticed when she walks into the room...
UNK: The Savvy that wakes her husband up in the middle of the night to make love.
Savvy : Yeah, I wonder if that Savvy is still going to be there.
Savvy : Honestly, I haven't a clue.
Savvy : But then I think, is that why Weiss married me?
Savvy : God, I hope not.
George : Could this place be any further away? It's like Siberia down here.
UNK: That's 'cause we don't like sick people.
UNK: Bailey distracted mutters : Oh.
UNK: You know, you're in a hospital.
George : Uh, are you Daisy?
Daisy : I don't deal with billing questions after 7 : 00p. m.
Daisy : - I'm just data entry at night. - No, actually, Stu sent me.
UNK: - Is this some kind of joke? - No. He's in this hospital.
George : He's had an accident. I'm his doctor. He's fine.
George : We're taking him into surgery. But he wanted me to find you.
UNK: You just tell that bastard that he could have come looking for me ten years ago.
UNK: - OK, hold it here. Is this good? - Yeah.
UNK: Lock it.
Alex : - What are you pissed about? - You look at everything in a skirt.
