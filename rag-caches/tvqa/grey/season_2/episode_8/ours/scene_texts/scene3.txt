UNK: George excited : Shouldn't he be more excited?
UNK: Maybe he's in shock. I don't know. I mean, he survived. That's huge.
UNK: He's got to realize, things happen for a reason.
UNK: Oh, yeah. My ex-boyfriend moved his wife to Seattle. Reason? To torture me.
George : - I'm serious. - So am I.
UNK: - What's with the Hello Kitty? - I don't want to talk about it.
Cristina : - Can I sign out to you early? - You don't want in on Stu's surgery?
Cristina : Can't. I have a test date. Burke is testing me.
Cristina : I've already spent an hour picking bird parts out of the guy. I'm over it.
UNK: Carpe diem.
UNK: I have a zit on my forehead and I am beginning to look how I feel.
UNK: - Carpe that. - This is the luckiest day in the world.
Cristina : Tell that to the bird.
