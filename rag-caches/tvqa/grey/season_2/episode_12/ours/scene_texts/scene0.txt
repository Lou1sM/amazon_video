UNK: It's an urban myth that suicide rates spike at the holidays.
UNK: Turns out, they actually go down.
UNK: Experts think it's because people are less inclined to off themselves
UNK: when surrounded by family.
George : Looks like Santa threw up in here.
UNK: Meredith nods : Just go with it, we're being supportive.
UNK: Oh, hey. What do you think?
UNK: Izzie finally notices them : Did I go too overboard?
UNK: Oh, I know sometimes I can go a little overboard.
George : - No, we love it. - It's great.
UNK: Oh, yay. I love Christmas.
Meredith : - We know. - Clearly.

UNK: actually do spike at the holidays.
UNK: Yeah, OK, Izzie doesn't count.
