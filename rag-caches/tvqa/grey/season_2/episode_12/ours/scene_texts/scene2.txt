UNK: George to Meredith : Look at her belly. She's almost as wide as she is tall.
Meredith : Are her ankles swollen? Is that why she's waddling?
UNK: - What happens when she leaves? - She's going on leave?
Meredith : What do you think happens when people push babies out their vaginas?
UNK: - Think we'll get a new resident? - Nah.
UNK: They'll let us wander unattended.
Alex : - See how much damage we can do. - Yeah, well, you would know.
Izzie : We should all get together and get Bailey a Christmas gift for the baby.
UNK: Or we could organize a Secret Santa thing.
UNK: - Listen, Tiny Tim, you can take your... - Secret Santa sounds great, Izzie.
George : OK.
UNK: Meredith nods : We're being supportive.
MVO : Hey.
Meredith : Hey. You OK? You seem...
Meredith : Yeah. You know...
MVO : - Holidays. - Oh.
Meredith : Yeah. I do know.
Meredith : Tim Epstein, 38, fell off the roof of his house.
Tim : I was stringing Hanumas lights and a shingle came loose.
Izzie : - Hanumas? - Hanumas. Christmukkah. We go all out.
UNK: Izzie broad smile : - Awesome. - He fell twelve feet.
UNK: The good news is, my head broke my fall.
Meredith : There are no visible deformities,
UNK: but he's having some focal left arm weakness.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein : He'll probably be fine. He's always been a little hard-headed.
Derek : - Does your head hurt when you laugh? - Is that a bad thing?
Derek : Do you wanna follow my finger with your eyes, please?
Jake : - I know karate. - Huh?
Tim : Uh...
UNK: Your husband might need a little quiet, so, there's a cafeteria...
UNK: No, no. Whoa. Let 'em stay.
UNK: Tim interrupts : Pain or no, I don't want to miss out on the holidays with my kids.
Derek : Who would like to take Mr. Epstein down for a CT?
Derek : Stevens it is.
UNK: - You should have a dog. - No dog.
UNK: Come on, get a dog.
George : Nadia Shelton, 41, scheduled for excision of her gastric ulcer.
UNK: Nadia's mother : Lot of good it's done. She's been scheduled for three days.
Nadia : Mom, it's not his fault.
UNK: Every day she gets rescheduled for emergencies.
UNK: - We are sorry for the inconvenience. - Inconvenience?
UNK: Nadia's Mother : Watch your child spend 3 days in pain, then talk to me about inconvenience.
Richard : We get a lot of trauma cases at the holidays.
UNK: - Your daughter's ulcer is non-emergent. - Is that the news?
UNK: Are you saying my wife's not important? Is that what I hear?
UNK: - When are you taking her? - It's not the remote.
UNK: We have reservations to eat at the Space Needle.
