Meredith : you keep shoving down everybody's throats.
UNK: Izzie finally notices them : - You... - What?
UNK: - "Boob?" - Dr. Scott to cath lab.
UNK: Somebody get in here. Doctor! Now!
UNK: Jimmy yelling : Do something.
UNK: Deep breaths.
UNK: George to Nadia : We're taking you to surgery. Prep her now.
Bailey : - It's about time. - Sorry, I got sidetracked.
George : Nadia Shelton's ulcer perforated.
George : She's vomiting blood by the pint.
Bailey : Is the chief back?
UNK: - I haven't seen him. - No.
UNK: All right, both of you, scrub in. I'm gonna need all the help I can get.
Derek : Well, there it is. Left side of his frontal lobe.
Derek : - Why didn't we see that before? - Intracerebral bleeds
Izzie : - can have a delayed presentation. - Right. You wanna get him out of there?
Derek : Just prep an OR. I'm gonna talk to his wife.
UNK: Derek sarcastic : Dr. Stevens.
UNK: Addison calls out : Nice talking to you.
UNK: Addison calls out : Think she'll ever talk to me again?
UNK: Addison calls out : Am I invisible? I'm feeling strangely invisible.
UNK: Addison calls out : - Also inaudible. - What?
Addison : Another surgery? So, I guess dinner-shopping is out?
MVO : Yeah. It's not gonna happen tonight. Sorry.
Bailey : You're not. I'm trying to figure out why you're not.
Addison : - It's Christmas, Derek. - Yeah, I know.
UNK: It's our season. What is going on? Are you mad? Depressed? What?
Derek : No. Mr. Epstein here is depressed.
Derek : He's bleeding from his frontal lobe.
Derek : Everything's fine, we're fine, Addie. I'll see you at home. OK?
UNK: You need a second surgery, Mr. Epstein.
UNK: The frontal lobe is difficult.
Derek : We may be able to improve things,
UNK: but you should be prepared for the possibility that things could get worse.
UNK: Tim anger in voice : That's great.
UNK: Tim anger in voice : That's just great.
UNK: I'm so glad we came to this hospital so I could be treated by a bunch of quacks
UNK: Tim anger in voice : who don't know their asses from the inside of my skull.
UNK: Can I talk to you?
UNK: Mrs. Epstein : This isn't my husband. This is not my husband.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein : He doesn't speak to me, or anyone, this way.
Derek : I know this is difficult,
Derek : but the important thing right now is that we stop the bleeding.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : He's the love of my life.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : And I know that you have a lot of other patients
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : and you do a lot of other surgeries.
UNK: But he's the love of my life.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : I just... I just need your word that you will treat this change
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : in my husband's personality as seriously as you would a fatal cancer.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : Because that's the way this feels to me and to my kids.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : We were happy. We were a happy family.
UNK: It just... If you could just fix it.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein trying not to cry : Just fix it.
UNK: Mrs. Epstein, I'm gonna do everything in my power, all right?
Meredith : OK?
Justin : I didn't want it.
Justin : I already got one new heart, I didn't deserve another one.
UNK: Father Michael : Justin, you don't have to feel guilty about having a new heart.
UNK: Father Michael : God wants you to live. That's why He sent you the heart.
Justin : I'm not stupid. God didn't send me the heart.
Justin : - There's no such thing as God. - Justin!
UNK: Father Michael : Marion. Marion, it's all right.
Justin : The heart I have now, my mom told me the heart came from Santa.
Justin : I thought elves made it in their factory or whatever.
Justin : - But that's not true, is it? - No, it isn't.
MVO : Yeah. Because I heard the nurses talking.
Justin : Where it really came from is some other kid.
Justin : Some other kid had to die so I could live.
Burke : Justin.
Izzie : Baby.
Justin : And then I outgrew that kid's heart.
Justin : So, for the last two years,
Justin : my mom has been praying that another kid would die for me.
Justin : That's what you pray for all the time.
Justin : Isn't it, Mom?
Justin : That's what she prayed for, Father.
Justin : - How does God feel about that? - Justin...
Burke : Justin...
UNK: Justin, baby. Wake up, Justin.
Izzie : Nurse!
UNK: - Oh, please, no, no... - Move, please.
