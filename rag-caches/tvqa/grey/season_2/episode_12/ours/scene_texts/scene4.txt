UNK: Three weeks post-op. Reported pain when we found him.
Paramedic : - Said something about fruitcake. - He must have torn his abdomen.
UNK: - You'll have to fight me for this one. - He's all yours. My parting gift.
UNK: OK, for your mom, I got a lambswool blanket, handmade in Edinburgh.
UNK: It's soft, comfortable, says "don't hate me for hurting your son" with fabric.
UNK: Derek tiredly : - You know my mom loves you. - No, she used to.
UNK: I gotta make up ground with these gifts.
UNK: - So, what do you think, plain or plaid? - I don't know. Whatever.
Addison : - You love Christmas shopping. - I'm not in the mood for it right now.
Addison : How about French food and Scottish catalogues tonight around nine?
UNK: - Well, I guess that depends... - Come on.
Izzie : - Dr. Shepherd? - Yeah?
Izzie : - I have Tim Epstein's CT scans. - Ah, good.
UNK: - OK, what do you think? - It's not great.
UNK: Oh, no, it's not great at all.
UNK: Honey bunny, what do you think of this?
George : Excuse me, I need to take her blood pressure.
UNK: - What is the guy saying? - I got three arch-moguls on my ass.
UNK: - Josh... - Language! Josh!
UNK: George tries to talk to Nadia : - Any questions about the surgery? - Apart from when you're gonna do it?
George : - We're doing it now. - Good.
Richard : - Sorry. - Don't apologize.
George : - Do you have any questions? - No.
UNK: I've had three bleeding ulcers in the last five years.
Jimmy : Yeah. I hope you read the chart.
Derek : - Yes. - Good.
UNK: - A gastric perforation just came in. - Damn.
Nurse : All right, take Mrs. Shelton back to her room.
Burke : - Seriously? - Do I look like I'm kidding?
Bailey : We'll get to her this afternoon.
Bailey : Grey, call the ER, tell them to send him up, and then scrub in.
Meredith : Alex Karev failed his boards, and he's retaking them tomorrow.
Meredith : He can't study for a practical by himself. If he fails again, he's out.
Bailey : OK, go.
Richard : - O'Malley. - Yeah?
Bailey : After you drop her off, get back here and scrub in.
Nurse : - All right. - OK.
UNK: - OK, Justin. - I don't want the heart.
Justin : - Why are you doing this? - Because you need it.
Cristina : And until you're 18, your mother calls all the shots.
UNK: My mother's a liar. You heard. She said the heart came from Santa.
UNK: - She shouldn't decide anything. - Well, you could make a run for it,
Cristina : but the heart you have won't get you very far.
Burke : - Are we ready? - Just about.
UNK: How about you, buddy? Are you ready?
UNK: If I die in the surgery, can you give this heart to some other kid?
Burke : Not gonna happen, Justin. Not on my watch.
Anesthesiologist : Here we go.
Daughter : ...and it was only one day of oil. - And then what happened?
UNK: - It lasted eight whole days and nights. - And it was a miracle.
Jake : - I wanted to say that part. - Sorry to interrupt.
Izzie : - You remember Dr. Shepherd? - Should we talk more privately?
UNK: Mrs. Epstein shakes her head : - Just tell us, is it bad? - The fall caused a subdural hematoma.
