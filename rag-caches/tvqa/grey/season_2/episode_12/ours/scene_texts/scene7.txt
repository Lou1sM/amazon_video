UNK: - How about here? Does it hurt here? - Yes, it does.
UNK: If you're Ionely, there are excellent vibrators. I can give you a catalogue.
UNK: - He failed his boards. I'm helping him. - Failed your practical?
UNK: - Glad you can keep a secret. - I kept it. It did you no good.
Meredith : - He needs our help. - You're not serious.
Meredith : If it were you?
Cristina : - It wouldn't be. - But what if it were?
Cristina : - It wouldn't be. - I have to go.
Meredith : Be a patient. Do it for me.
UNK: When Tiny Tim goes Norman Bates on us I'm blaming you.
Meredith : - Diagnosis? - Gallstones.
Derek : Yes.
UNK: I'm a 55-year-old man, I'm nauseous, and I'm throwing up.
UNK: I didn't ask for any help.
UNK: OK, Evil Spawn, you can nurse your pride, key word being "nurse",
Cristina : or you can pass your test and be a doctor. Up to you.
UNK: Alex sighs and stands in front of her : - Any abdominal pain? - Yes,
Cristina : from my giant fat belly all the way to my back.
Cristina : Oh, and I'm drunk. Hiccup, hiccup.
UNK: Meredith hands Bailey the chart : I got another one for you.
Bailey : He tried to gift wrap a 70-inch TV for his wife?
George : - Hernia? - Strangulated. Pretty ugly.
UNK: And you just know the wife hates TV. Grey, is that other project covered?
Meredith : - I think so. - Then scrub in.
Bailey : O'Malley, go tell Nadia Shelton she's off the schedule until tomorrow.
UNK: Jimmy shocked : - Tomorrow? - Another day won't kill me, Jimmy.
George : - Tomorrow for sure. - Today was "for sure".
Ernie : What's he saying?
UNK: Nadia's Mother yells : - They can't operate until tomorrow! - Outrageous!
UNK: I cannot believe this!
UNK: Could you please turn that down? Your mother needs to rest.
UNK: Who are you, my dad?
UNK: - Sir, please tell your son... - Don't talk to me about my son.
Jimmy : - Who the hell do you think you are? - Sorry.
UNK: I just think that your wife should rest.
UNK: - I can't go Christmas shopping... - You messed me up.

UNK: Yeah. OK, the way you're grabbing me now, it's assault.
UNK: This... is an exam. Pads.
UNK: What... What the hell? Does Izzie know... Does Burke know about this?
Cristina : Unbunch your panties, George. We're helping Alex study. Do it.
George : I can't hear you when his hand is on your boob.
Cristina : Take your hand off my boob, Alex.
UNK: Thank you. Study for what?
Alex : - Shut it, Yang. - Alex failed his boards.
Burke : - Seriously? - I failed one part of one board.
UNK: Still, that's pretty embarrassing.
UNK: Hey, he's all yours, Georgie. Do your worst.

George : Do not ask me to cough.
UNK: Dr. Cohen to Radiology.
Cristina : You paged me?
Burke : I didn't see a psych consult scheduled here.
Cristina : I couldn't get one. I tried to, but they told me to come back in January.
Burke : You disrespected me. You mocked me in my OR.
Burke : - That can't happen. - I... It won't happen again.
Burke : You equated my spirituality with a belief in Santa Claus.
Cristina : Burke, science is the one thing, you know,
Cristina : it's the one thing we have in common.

Cristina : I'm a slob and you're not.
