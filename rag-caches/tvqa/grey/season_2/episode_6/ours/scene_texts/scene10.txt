UNK: - Good morning. - How's Brooke?
Addison : She's good.
Izzie : - And the baby? - He came through, too.
Addison : So, have you made a decision yet, Dr. Stevens?
Izzie : I'm sorry?
UNK: Whether or not you're going to hate me.
Addison : You're Meredith's friend. I'm the wicked witch who cheated on Dr...
Addison : Wait, what is it that you guys call him?
UNK: Meredith perks a bit at this news : McDreamy.
Addison : Right. God, doesn't that embarrass him?
Izzie : Yeah, I think it does.
Addison : - By all rights, you should hate me. - I guess.
UNK: Except that I'm gonna be staying in town for a while.
UNK: - You are? - Yes.
Addison : And you show a real gift with my specialty.
Addison : And I have a lot to teach, if you want to learn.
Cristina : So...
Addison : So, when you decide how important it is for you to hate me, let me know.
UNK: Did she uh... Did she suffer?
Derek : No. Her injuries prevented her from...
Derek : No, she wasn't in any pain.
UNK: Tom half chuckles happy : Good. That's...
UNK: She asked me to... to tell you that...
UNK: Derek difficulty speaking : She wanted you to know that if love were enough...
UNK: Derek difficulty speaking : that if love were enough, that she'd still be here with you.
UNK: As surgeons,
UNK: there are so many things we have to know.
Richard : - Fine work, Dr. Karev. - Thank you, sir.
UNK: We have to know we have what it takes.
UNK: We have to know how to take care of our patients.
Burke : Tom is doing just fine.
UNK: And how to take care of each other.
Addison : - OK? - Yeah.
UNK: Eventually we even have to figure out...
UNK: how to take care of ourselves.
UNK: As surgeons, we have to be in the know.
UNK: But as human beings,
UNK: sometimes it's better to stay in the dark.
UNK: Because in the dark, there may be fear...
UNK: but there's also hope.
Bailey : Better get cleaned up. Rounds. Five minutes.
