Meredith : Sorry.
Meredith : So you operated on a heart earlier. You'd think you could draw blood.
George : - I rocked that heart. - Yeah, you did.
George : I think I'm strung out on the scalpel.
UNK: Meredith smiling : Nothing wrong with that.
George : So any news? About...
Meredith : No. I can't read him.
George : I think it's pretty amazing you even gave him the choice.
George : And I think, for what it's worth,
George : I think he's crazy if he doesn't pick you.
Cristina : Please tell me you've seen a right leg, a cleanly severed right leg.
Meredith : No.
Meredith : How weird is this job?
Meredith : Weird.
Izzie : - Brooke? - Jana?
Brooke : - Thank God. - Dr. Karev?
Alex : - I couldn't stop her. - She was on the train?
UNK: - Yes, but... - Have you done an ultrasound?
UNK: Addison slightly angry : Cleared her C-spine?
UNK: Is there a reason why she is wandering around the hospital unattended?
Alex : She's not unattended. I came up with her. She's...
UNK: You can leave now, Dr. Karev.
Addison : Irresponsible even for an intern.
UNK: What? You disagree?
Izzie : She wanted to see her friend. I mean, what was he supposed to do, tackle her?
Addison : Dr. Stevens, why don't you get our new patient into a bed? Shall we?
Derek : Can you feel that, Miss Krasnoff?
Bonnie : You're a cute doctor. Cute doctors get to call me by my first name.
UNK: Derek smiling : - Bonnie? - Mmm.
UNK: OK, Bonnie. Can you feel that, Bonnie?
Bonnie : Can I feel what? Oh. Well, I guess that's a no.
Doctor : - Dr. Shepherd? - Yes.
George : - I got the labs. - Great, thank you.
Derek : Here you go. Hold that, please.
Derek : Could you try to wiggle your toes, Mr. Maynard?
Tom : - Are they moving? - Yes, they are.
UNK: Tom half chuckles happy : - Good. That's good, right? - Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
Bonnie : What about me? Are mine moving?
Derek : Yes, they are.
UNK: Bonnie smiles in relief : Yay me.
UNK: - Dr. Shepherd, is it? - Yes, it is.
UNK: Dr. Shepherd, Bonnie and I...
UNK: - are we going to live through this? - Now that's just morose, Tom.
Tom : I'm sorry, dear.
Yvonne : Doctor?
UNK: We're going to do everything we can, Mr. Maynard.
UNK: About time. I was starting to think my work here would be wasted.
Cristina : So sorry. It wasn't easy to find.
UNK: I checked the wound and it's very clean cut, well preserved.
UNK: Dr. Webber?
Cristina : Sir?
Richard : Notice anything else about that leg? Anything other than that very clean cut?
Richard : Did you happen to notice, for example, that it was shaved recently?
Richard : And manicured? Take a look at my patient, Dr. Yang.
Richard : Does he look like a man who woke up and shaved one of his legs this morning?
Meredith : No.
UNK: I'll go find the right... the right right leg.
UNK: Cristina backing out of the O.R slowly : - The right... - Thank you.
Burke : - Where are we? - You were right. Vitals are erratic.
