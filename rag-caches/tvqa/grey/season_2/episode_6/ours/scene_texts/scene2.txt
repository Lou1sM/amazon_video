UNK: Ow! Ow. Ow.
UNK: - What are you doing? - Trying to insert my banana bag.
Meredith : Which sounds vaguely dirty, but it isn't.
UNK: Izzie pulling the curtain closed : I can do it.
UNK: So, how's it going with Addison?
UNK: Bad mood? Good mood? "Yay, my husband picked me" mood?
UNK: I think it's more of an "I hate the smell of charred flesh" mood.
Meredith : Before you judge me, I know there was a train accident.
Meredith : People are very badly hurt.
Meredith : And that I'm a vapid narcissist when you mix me with alcohol.
Meredith : In case you were wondering, I know that.
Izzie : Well, for what it's worth, I take issue with her salmon-colored scrubs.
UNK: I mean, what self-respecting surgeon wears salmon-colored scrubs?
UNK: Meredith nods : - This is what I'm saying. - Yeah.
Derek : Thank you.
