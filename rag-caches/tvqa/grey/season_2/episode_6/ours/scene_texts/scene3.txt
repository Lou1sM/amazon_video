UNK: Richard calls out : Yang, how's that wound looking?
Cristina : Pretty clean. Some dirt and gravel.
UNK: He was lucky. It's a guillotine injury.
UNK: Richard to Derek : We do this right, he'll have full use of his leg.
UNK: Richard to Derek : More irrigation.
Doctor : Dr. Shepherd?
Derek : It'll wait.
Richard : I'm fine, Derek. Just adjusting to the light.
UNK: Derek shakes his head : There's no shame in taking more time off.
UNK: It doesn't make you old or tired or rusty, it...
UNK: Derek shakes his head : OK, that came out wrong.
Richard : You're the only attending neurosurgeon, you're needed elsewhere. I'm fine here.
Doctor : Dr. Shepherd?
Derek : OK. Page me if you need me.
UNK: When you're finished cleaning that wound, you can help me, Dr. Yang.
Richard : Is the wound clean, Yang?
UNK: - Yes, sir, I... But... - But what?
Richard : If your plan is to be a watchdog for Dr. Shepherd
Richard : or if you think your job here is to baby-sit me, then you can think again.
Richard : I've been a surgeon longer than you've been breathing.
Richard : If I were not ready to be in this OR, I would say so. Is that understood?
Cristina : - Yes, sir. - Now do we have a problem, Yang?
UNK: Yes. No, sir.
Cristina : I'm thrilled to learn. And I'm grateful to be here.
UNK: It's just that...
UNK: Meredith slightly inebriated : Um...
Cristina : Sorry. His legs...
UNK: What about them?
Cristina : They're both left.
UNK: Richard annoyed : - Find the man's leg, Yang. Find it now. - Yes, sir.
George : Is it going straight through her spine?
