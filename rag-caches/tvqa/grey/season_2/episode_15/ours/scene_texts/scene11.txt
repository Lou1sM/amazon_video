UNK: Meredith crying : I don't... I can't,
UNK: Meredith crying : I can't, I don't...
UNK: Meredith crying : I don't... I can't.
Izzie : I don't want... I don't want my mother to die alone.
UNK: Derek whispers : Slow down. Just slow down.
UNK: Derek whispers : Shh.
UNK: Derek whispers : Slow deep breaths now. Slow deep breaths.
UNK: Derek calm quiet voice : Slow down. Slow down. Just breathe in the bag.
Meredith : I'm OK.
UNK: Derek smiles : You're OK.
Burke : Thank you.
Derek : You're welcome.
Cheyenne : Do you ever wish you hadn't done it?
Izzie : No. I really don't.
Cheyenne : If I give her up...
Cheyenne : if I give her away, do I still get to name her?
Izzie : You can name her for yourself.
Cheyenne : Did you name yours?
Izzie : Sarah.
UNK: Cheyenne smiles : That's a pretty name.
Cristina : Yeah.
Meredith : I think you should keep visiting her.
Richard : You sure?
Cristina : Yeah.
Meredith : She lights up when you're around.
Meredith : She's alive.
Cristina : Oh, she's with Alex. I can't do this in front of Alex.
Burke : - Well, you can and you will. - Excuse me, why aren't you apologizing?
Burke : I'm an attending, I don't apologize to residents.
Burke : You, on the other hand, are an intern.
UNK: Any available scrub nurse to OR 3.
Cristina : Sydney, I just wanted to...
UNK: ...uh, just wanted to, um...
Cristina : ...apologize for, you know, overstepping... I'm sorry.
Sydney : Well, that's the compassion I was looking for.
Sydney : Apology accepted. OK, you want to hug it out?
Izzie : - Oh. - Go. Hug.
Cristina : - Oh. Yeah. - Come on.
UNK: Nurses at Seattle Grace are...
Richard : - We need them, Patricia. - Yes, we need them.
Richard : So where do I find the spare change?
UNK: It's not like what's hiding underneath the couch cushions is going to do it.
UNK: I seem to remember pushing paperwork for a multi-million dollar surgery robot.
UNK: There was a waiting list for that. It will bring in huge business.
Patricia : And could you and the robot handle that business without nurses?
UNK: We can't help ourselves.
UNK: We see a line, we want to cross it.
UNK: Maybe it's the thrill of trading the familiar for the unfamiliar.
UNK: - A sort of personal dare. - Congratulations.
UNK: Only problem is... once you've crossed
UNK: it's almost impossible to go back.
George : You OK?
UNK: Yeah. You know, I am.
George : You OK?
Cristina : Yeah.
UNK: George to both of them : What happened today?
Resident : - Nothing. - Nothing.
Izzie : OK.
Izzie : We don't know everything about each other, George.
Cristina : Yeah.
George : True.
UNK: But, if you do manage to make it back across that line,
UNK: you find safety in numbers.
UNK: - Anybody want to have sex? - George.
