UNK: Oh. Do you want to...?
UNK: Oh, no. No, we've already said our good-byes.
UNK: Agnes interrupts : We just wanted to be here when Grace crossed over.
UNK: Sydney stops doing the surgery, turns around and interrupts : Ready.
Richard : - I can take care of this. - I did it. I should undo it.
UNK: How long? I mean, before...?
Meredith : It can take a while.
Cristina : - She wants me to apologize. - You crossed the line.
Burke : - You made me cross the line. - Oh, like I can make you do anything.
Burke : It's not your fault. It's mine.
Burke : I'm your teacher. I'm supposed to be.
Burke : But you came to me as your boyfriend. And I responded that way.
Cristina : - I'm not used to being wrong. - I know. But you're an intern.
UNK: Second-guessing a resident is not your job.
Meredith : How long has it been?
UNK: Two hours and 17 minutes.
Meredith : I saw you there.
Meredith : At the nursing home with my mother.
Izzie : Oh.
Meredith : They said you go two or three times a week.
UNK: Richard nods : Whenever I can.
Meredith : Why did you keep it a secret?
Cheyenne : I don't know.
UNK: Richard sighs : Would you like me to stop going?
UNK: I'm going to go check on Grace.
UNK: Do you think she's Ionely? My mother?
Richard : Yeah, I do.
Ruth : May she rest in peace.
UNK: Time of death... 12 : 42.
