Sydney : I was looking for you guys in the locker room, but you weren't there.
UNK: Then I thought, "Maybe my interns are looking for me too."
UNK: Then I come out here and here you are.
UNK: Yeah! You guys look like a great group!
UNK: Awesome. My horoscope said it was going to be a very challenging day,
Sydney : and I was a little worried. But, no. You guys...
Sydney : Yeah, you look like a good group.
UNK: Which is great because we are going to have so much fun. Hi! Hi, first of all.
Cristina : Ow. Ow.
UNK: - Sorry. Am I hurting you? - No, you're touching me.
UNK: I'm Sydney Heron. Fourth year.
UNK: Sydney has an Oh look on her face but loses it quickly : My philosophy, just so you know, is, um, is heal with love.
UNK: OK? So, wonderful. So, Alex, Izzie, Meredith, Cristina.
UNK: Our group is just missing...
UNK: O'Malley. He's cowering behind the strike line like a girl.
Sydney : Standing up for what he believes in, that's my kind of girl. Right?
Sydney : The ER needs somebody down there for a consult.
UNK: - Does anybody... Who wants to... - We get to pick?
UNK: - Me! I'm on it! - I'll help.
Meredith : I have patients I need to check on.
UNK: So it looks like just you and me, Izzie McGee.
UNK: All right. It's Stevens. Izzie Stevens.
UNK: Oh, no. I knew! I was just rhyming.
Izzie : Oh. Rhyming. Right. Yeah, that's neat.
UNK: - Dr. Stevens? - Yeah.
UNK: - Can I use you on a consult? - OK, I'm on it! Absolutely.
Cristina : Yeah.
Alex : - You need a consult for a rash? - It's spreading pretty fast.
UNK: I wanted to be sure there's nothing surgical.
UNK: Mrs. Solomon? Oh!
Claire : Sorry.
Wade : - We're on our honeymoon. - Yeah.
UNK: Alex nods approvingly : Sweet.
UNK: Cristina shoots Alex a disapproving look : Can you, um...
UNK: ...dismount, please?
Cristina : - Yeah. - OK, great.
Nurses : Ah!
UNK: Len! Lenny.
Grace : Is that you?
Grace : Lenny.
Meredith : Are you OK, ma'am?
UNK: "Grace Bickham." Mrs. Bickham, do you know who your doctor is?
UNK: - Len? - I don't see your chart here.
Grace : - Are you there? - I need you to calm down for me, OK?
Grace : - Lenny? - Is that your husband?
Grace : Where is he? He was here.
Meredith : I'm sure he'll be back any moment.
UNK: You're having trouble breathing. I need to run some tests.
Grace : - Lenny. - Nurse? I need a nurse in here!
UNK: Fair hours, fair wages! Fair hours, fair wages!
