UNK: Cristina interrupts : - you'll get IV antibiotics. - If it does cross the line?
UNK: It'd mean the infection's aggressive. We'd have to do a muscle biopsy.
UNK: - You'd take out a piece of my muscle? - Mm-hm.
Claire : - We're supposed to run a 10K tomorrow. - Oh, on this leg? I doubt it.
Alex : Can you tell us when you noticed the rash?
Wade : When we were climbing Rainier yesterday.
UNK: Wow! You go up the Emmons Glacier route?
Claire : Please. You can do that in an SUV. We did Liberty Ridge.
UNK: Oh, wow. That's hardcore.
Sydney : Hi, I'm Sydney Heron. These guys' teacher.
UNK: Claire shakes her hand : I'm Claire, this is Wade. It's our honeymoon.
Sydney : Wow, that's amazing. God, look at that rock.
UNK: Cristina annoyed : Did you sustain any trauma on the hike? Did you fall down or bang your leg?
MVO : - No. - Well, she cut her foot
UNK: on oyster shells at the beach a couple days ago.
UNK: - We were windsurfing in Puget Sound. - Oh, wow.
UNK: You need a honeymoon to recover from your honeymoon.
George : - Ow. - Right?
UNK: My leg's going to be OK, right?
Alex : Yeah. It's probably a simple skin infection.
UNK: Uh, no, it's not. Look.
George : - Hey. - Hey.
Derek : - Your dog's fine. - He's your dog now.
Meredith : I miss him.
Addison : He misses you too.
Addison : You should come visit.
Addison : The dog, I mean.
Meredith : I'm walking away now.
UNK: So I'm looking for a neurosurgeon to consult on a fetal spinal tumor.
UNK: Do you know anybody good?
UNK: - Fair hours, fair wages! - Don't ask George.
UNK: - I'm not. He's a doctor. - Go ahead. Just ask him.
UNK: George to himself : I'm showing support. They whisper and point.
UNK: - George? - What?
Olivia : - We need a favor. - Ava Jenkins in peds, room 4114.
UNK: It's time to change her dressing and it's scary for her
Debbie : but if you sing the alphabet or the Wheels on the Bus song
Debbie : - she can handle it. - Ms. O'Brien from 2412?
UNK: She'll have a panic attack if they don't check on her once an hour.
UNK: - And there's this guy in 2924... - Hang on. Hang on.
George : You want me to cross the picket line?
Cristina : - Yeah. - Why?
Olivia : Because they're our patients too, George.
Olivia : And we can't.
Sydney : - Anyone care to probe the wound? - I do.
UNK: I'd like to try your "healing with love".
Sydney : I like the way you think, Alex. You do the honors.
UNK: Cristina, it looks like someone needs to learn how to share.
UNK: Now slide it in.
Alex : - Whoa. No resistance. - Let me see.
UNK: - Dr. Heron? - Let me see.
UNK: Sydney into the phone : Yes?
Cristina : No healthy muscle gives way that easily.
