UNK: All right, Dr. O'Malley!
Meredith : Help! I need a nurse in here. Her pressure's falling.
UNK: - She stopped breathing. - Whoa. Is she dying?
Meredith : - Are you a nurse? - I'm, like, a nursing student.
Meredith : I need to intubate. Get a 7.5 tube.
Meredith : They're out in the hall.
Meredith : Not that one. The one that says 7-5.
Meredith : - I'm in. - Awesome.
Cheyenne : Is that too much?
Addison : It's a lot of extra amniotic fluid, Cheyenne, but your baby looks strong.
UNK: Ms. Wood : Does that mean we can go? I mean, I appreciate you seeing us,
UNK: Ms. Wood : but this is a long drive for us and I can't afford to miss another shift.
UNK: Addison to Cheyenne : Unfortunately, Ms. Wood, the mass on the baby's neck
UNK: Addison to Cheyenne : is what's causing the build-up of fluid.
UNK: Addison to Cheyenne : It's also obstructing her airway and the spine.
Izzie : - Mom? - It's all right. Let's listen.
UNK: We're gonna do a procedure called an EXIT surgery.
Addison : We do a C-Section and half deliver the baby.
Cheyenne : Half deliver?
UNK: We pull the head and arms out, but we don't cut the umbilical cord.
Cheyenne : Why?
Izzie : The tumor won't let air get to the baby's lungs.
Izzie : We need the umbilical cord to keep her alive during the operation.
UNK: It's cool, if you think about it.
UNK: You'll be your baby's life support machine.
Addison : After the surgery, if all goes well, we cut the umbilical cord
Addison : and you'll be the mother of a healthy baby girl.
UNK: - How's that sound? - It sounds expensive.
Addison : Well, your doctor at the clinic is a former student of mine.
Addison : So... it's covered.
UNK: I'm going to go ahead and take this up to the lab.
UNK: The hospital gets a write-off, and it makes Dr. Shepherd look good, so...
UNK: Ms. Wood : - So it's not charity? - It's not charity.
Izzie : - What time's your shift? - 6 : 00 to 6 : 00.
UNK: - Graveyard. In Chehalis? - Yeah.
UNK: That's three hours away.
UNK: You better get going. I'll look out for her.
UNK: Incoming temp nurses to conference room three.
Ellis : - Chief. - Hello, Meredith.
Meredith : Saw my mother this morning.
Richard : Did you?
Richard : How is she?
Meredith : She's fine.
UNK: Richard uneasy : I'm glad to hear it.
UNK: Richard uneasy : Give her my best.
UNK: Why are you...?
UNK: It's to mark the borders of the infection.
UNK: Cristina interrupts : We'll watch it. If it doesn't cross the line,
