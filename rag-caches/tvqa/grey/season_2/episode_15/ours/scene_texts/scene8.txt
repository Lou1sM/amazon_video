UNK: - You're the head of the whole hospital? - Just the surgeons.
UNK: Eleanor pats Richard's leg : Well, they should make you the head of everything.
UNK: Ruth mutters to Agnes : She's batting the lashes. You see this?
Agnes : Dr. Webber, the point is, Grace wants to be with her Lenny.
Agnes : She misses him terribly.
Meredith : You realize if I pull out the tube, Grace will die?
Agnes : We're old, magpie. Not daft.
Ruth : Pull the plug. It's what she wants.
Richard : Ladies, I appreciate your concern for your friend.
Richard : But we need to contact a durable power of attorney to sign the release.
Eleanor : - That's Alice. Call Alice. - Grace's daughter.
Agnes : She's a lesbian.
Eleanor : Well, that's OK, isn't it?
UNK: I mean, she can still have the power of attorney.
UNK: Uh, fine. But we'll need Alice's signature.
Ruth : - Good luck. She lives in Oregon. - Oh, she can fax it.
Meredith : I'm sorry. We'll need her original signature.
UNK: Well, can't we just skip that part?
UNK: Ruth mutters to Agnes : Bat the lashes again. I think it was working.
Richard : Excuse me, ladies.
UNK: You're like the Old-Lady Whisperer.
Meredith : They really cheer up when you come around.
Richard : Meredith, you understand if the daughter shows up tomorrow
Richard : and confirms she is DNR...
Meredith : I have to kill my patient. I know.
Richard : How you doing?
UNK: There something I can do for you?
Meredith : Oh, I'm fine, sir. I don't need any help from you. Thank you.
UNK: "Sir, fare you well.
UNK: Hereafter, in a better world than this
UNK: I shall desire more love and knowledge of you."
UNK: To Dr. O'Malley!
Olivia : - O'Malley! - Whoo!
Cristina : She called me unkind.
Cristina : Unkind and lacking in compassion. In front of my boyfriend.
Cristina : I am not unkind.
Meredith : I think I have to kill a woman tomorrow.
Meredith : I have to take out the tube that's keeping her alive.
UNK: Sydney has an Oh look on her face but loses it quickly : Izzie.
Joe : This is the part where you say what's wrong with you.
UNK: - Where're you going? - I have to...
Izzie : - I forgot something at work. - We don't need her.
Meredith : - I have to kill a woman tomorrow. - And that's a problem why?
Cristina : If it's what she wants, it's what she wants.
Cristina : And that is not unkind or lacking in compassion.
Cristina : I'm a very compassionate person.
UNK: - I'm more compassionate than Alex. - Shut your pie hole, Yang.
UNK: Hey, Joe? Could we have another round, please?
Alex : Yeah, give Nurse O'Malley a drink on me.
George : What'd you say?
George : - Hey, uh, Karev just called me a nurse. - At least nurses aren't butchers.
UNK: The worst thing you could come up with? Was that an insult
UNK: or is that, uh... was supposed to be funny?
Nurse : Whoopsie.
Cristina : Are you kidding me?
Cristina : - I will kill you, you know that? - Bring it on.
UNK: Bring..."Oh, bring it on." OK, mama! Let's bring it on!
UNK: There's your squad. Do you want to cheer it out, soccer mom?
UNK: - Are you going to throw down bedpans? - Soccer mom?
UNK: Hey, hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
UNK: Hey! If you beat each other up,
UNK: there won't be anybody left to set your broken bones.
UNK: - Oh, that would be my job! - Hey!
UNK: ...studying my bones. - Hey!
Meredith : - We were just leaving. - Yeah, I've got to go save lives.
Nurse : Bye!
Richard : Excuse me. They're my ride.
Izzie : You're awake.
Cheyenne : Hey. Yeah. Baby jumps up and down on my belly all night,
Cheyenne : makes me have to pee all the time.
Cheyenne : - You work long hours, huh? - Yeah.
Izzie : But I'm off work now. I...
Izzie : I just came back to talk to you.
UNK: - I grew up in Chehalis too. - Serious?
Cristina : Serious. Um, Forest Park.
UNK: - The trailer park up behind the church. - On Route Six.
Cheyenne : - My friend Shelley lives up there. - My mom still lives there.
George : - No way. - Yeah.
Izzie : Can you keep a secret?
