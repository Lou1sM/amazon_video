George : Can't cross the picket line. I can't.
UNK: I don't like it, George, but what choice do we have?
Izzie : You took an oath to heal. You're a healer.
George : Dad's a truck driver, Mom's a teacher. The news shows me crossing this line?
George : They'll outlive me just to pee on my grave.
UNK: In general, lines are there for a reason.
Cristina : Has there been any blood yet? I heard they brought in scab nurses.
UNK: For safety. For security.
UNK: For clarity.
UNK: I think the nurses would know we are on their side. Don't they?
Cristina : We're doctors. We have sick patients inside! I mean, we have surgeries.
Izzie : OK.
Izzie : Then you go first.
UNK: - Don't cross! Scabs! - Screw it.
George : Fair hours! Fair wages! Fair hours! Fair wages!
Cristina : Yeah, doing my job. Doing my job. Ha-ha!
UNK: Izzie to George : They threw food at her! That is just wrong!
Izzie : Fine. I'm going in.
UNK: - Change your own bedpans, Stevens! - Enjoy your syphilis, Olivia!
UNK: Izzie yells out : - George, are you coming? - No, I'm good here.
UNK: If you choose to cross the line, you do so at your own risk.
Meredith : - Good morning. - Morning, Meredith!
Meredith : - How is she today? - She's great.
Nurse : She really lights up when Dr. Webber visits.
UNK: Ellis laughs : And I did not back down.
UNK: Ellis laughs : Not in my OR, not in front of those jock Ortho idiots.
UNK: It was the last time Windsor called you "little lady." Even behind your back.
UNK: One day, I'll be Chief of Surgery. The first woman Chief. You watch.
Richard : I don't doubt it.
UNK: So why is it...
UNK: Don't doubt for a minute.
UNK: ... that the bigger the line, the greater the temptation to cross it?
UNK: Fair hours, fair wages! Fair hours, fair wages!
Patricia : And I can't say this enough. Charts are organized by room number.
UNK: I know you're temps, but there's no excuse for sloppiness.
UNK: - Where's Edmonds' chart? - I need vitals.
UNK: Patricia interrupts their babble : Know why I stopped being a nurse? Doctors.
UNK: Patricia interrupts their babble : Doctors who don't know how to pitch in.
Burke : Right.
Derek : This place is going to hell. We need the real nurses.
UNK: We need 40 nurses to relieve the overtime that they're striking about.
UNK: That's $2 million a year we don't have.
Derek : Have you checked under the couch? I always find spare change there.
Derek : OK, I'm silencing myself.
Cristina : That's him. He's published twice and he's flawless.
UNK: He's a freak. He doesn't let you speak in the OR.
Cristina : - Yeah, but he's flawless. - I think it is him. What's his name?
Cristina : Oh, yeah. Mouth breather guy.
Cristina : But he'll let you do a procedure on your own if he likes you.
Meredith : - What are we doing? - Figuring out who'll replace Bailey.
UNK: Yang! Stevens! Grey! O'Malley! Karev! Here you are!
