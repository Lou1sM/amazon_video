Richard : When Leo Tolstoy here wakes up
Richard : you might get him to revisit the idea of a new vocation.
Alex : - He was pretty against the idea. - Hopefully it was just delirium.
UNK: If it's all right, I'd like to keep an eye on him post-op.
UNK: - He was acting strange. - He ate a novel. Clearly, he's strange.
Bex : It's just, I don't want to overlook anything.
Richard : Seriously, Karev. I'm short-handed all over the hospital.
Richard : OK, here we go.
UNK: Richard calls out : Anybody here tempted to read this?
UNK: Richard calls out : No takers?
UNK: Richard calls out : Could be the great American novel. We'll never know.
UNK: Richard calls out : He needs a plan B.
Alex : He's not the only one.
Richard : You don't think you passed?
Alex : - I thought I passed the first time. - Well, let's wait and see.
Richard : Right now, today, you're still here.
Bex : Did you tell my parents about the pill?
