Derek : What look?
Meredith : - That look. Our look. I'm over you. - I'm over you too.
Meredith : - You are? - No.
UNK: Meredith matter of factly : Oh. Well, I am.
Meredith : Over you.
Derek : - I'm over you too. - You just said... Shut up.
Izzie : - Hi. - Bye.
UNK: Derek sighs : There is a land called Passive-Aggressiva
UNK: Derek sighs : - and you are their queen. - I am fine.
Derek : - Except when you shriek about trout. - I was not.

UNK: - Last three weeks have been about that? - Yes.
UNK: - Not about saying I love Meredith? - "Loved."
Ellis : - What? - You said "loved." Past tense.
UNK: Derek looks down : Yes, past tense.
Addison : Well, then I have been shrieking about the trailer.
UNK: Mauer, time to return your book to the library. Surgery is in an hour.
UNK: - What's this sweat? - Probably nerves.
UNK: But I'm sweating like Nixon. President Richard Milhous Nixon.
Mauer : That guy could sweat. And I, Mauer Paskowitz,
UNK: I wrote an epically crap novel, but I can sweat like Nixon.
UNK: It's not even that bad. I read practically every draft.
Mauer : Forgive me, but you are not Lionel Trilling.
Mauer : - It blows. - Lionel Trilling?

Audrey : - The dead don't read. - Ever think about being
Alex : - something other than a writer? - No.
Mauer : I am a writer. Mauer Paskowitz. I have no plan B.
UNK: We can't marry for three years until the book is done.
UNK: Three years I listen to him piss and moan for what? So he can eat the thing?
Mauer : - Ha! - Your computer have a "delete" button?
Mauer : I wanted to literally put it behind me and start a new book.
UNK: OK, we all get the symbolism. It's painfully obvious.
Alex : And obviously painful.

Bailey : - You reached 80 hours? - Technically.
Bailey : You're off work, Cristina. Go enjoy your day.
UNK: No, I'll enjoy my day if I can help retrieve a heart. I promise.
Cristina : It's a nice coat.
Addison : - You see that, Dr. O'Malley? - The tumor is compressing an ovary.
UNK: Yep. That's why I biopsied both ovaries.
