Bex : - Is that bad? - It's just a precaution, Bex.
Addison : - Apply pressure, Dr. O'Malley. - Mm-hm.
UNK: I'll get this to path. Mind doing the dressings?
Derek : Sure.
UNK: All right, Bex. Then we'll get you the results just as soon as possible.
Bex : You're a doctor. Haven't you seen scars before?
UNK: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out
George : why someone with so much talent would want to do that.
Bex : It's just a comic book.
UNK: It's about me and my best friend Jenn when we were kids.
Bex : - Satisfied? - Does she write it with you?
UNK: Jenn has a boyfriend like everyone else.
Bex : I get to be a freak all by myself.
UNK: Oh, a freak. That's not the easiest thing to be in high school, is it?
Bex : You sound like my shrink.
George : Hey, I wasn't always a doctor. In high school...
UNK: ...I was secretary and treasurer
George : of the Dungeons and Dragons club.
UNK: Bex chuckles : - Oh, man. - Yeah.
George : I was also a mathlete, and I won the blue ribbon in biology club.
George : Best fetal pig dissection.
George : And let me tell you, that had the girls knocking down my door.
George : You just have to get through high school.
UNK: 'Cause high school sucks for anyone who's the least bit different.
George : But then there's college, and then out in the real world,
UNK: you'll find where you fit in.
Bex : - You think so? - Yeah, I know so.
Izzie : - Hi. - Denny. I thought you were asleep.

Izzie : I'll take my chances with Hilde. I can do girl-on-girl.
UNK: Oh! See, how can I blackmail you if you bring up girl-on-girl?
UNK: What do you want to know?
Denny : - That guy Alex... you with him? - No.
Izzie : - Not anymore. And never, ever again. - Good.
Izzie : - Good? - Yeah. Good.
Denny : It means I won't have to fight him for you.
UNK: Why do you think I want you to fight for me?
UNK: - Hello. You are in love with me. - Am I?
UNK: Denny grinning : Yeah, it's not your fault. I mean, I'm well-off, but I'm not into money.
UNK: Denny grinning : I'm smart, but I'm not a know-it-all. I'm funny.
UNK: I'm... I'm really nice. I love animals.

George : - You paged me? - Yeah.
Addison : Have a look at this. It's Bex's biopsy.
George : - Biopsied ovary? - Not exactly.
UNK: Arrange a meeting with Bex's parents, George.
UNK: Find the psychiatrist, if they're available.
UNK: George looks up : - Does she have cancer? - No.

George : - Are you sure? - Yes. I'm sure.
UNK: George amazed : - Bex is a hermaphrodite? - Yes.
