Izzie : No.
Bex : Am I gonna die? Is that what no one wants to tell me?
George : - Of course not. - Then why are my parents acting so...
UNK: Will you just tell me what's going on?
UNK: George writing in her chart : We're prepping you for surgery
UNK: George writing in her chart : to remove the lymph node tumor that's compressing your...
George : Ovary.
UNK: Hey, Bex. How are you doing?
UNK: Bex sits up : Mom, Dad, this is really freaking me out.
UNK: - Oh, no. Everything's gonna be fine. - It's OK, sweetie.
Bex : I'm having surgery to remove a tumor that's compressing my ovary.
Bex : Right, George?
Addison : Dr. O'Malley.
Bex : George?
UNK: - What, am I supposed to lie to her? - OK. That's enough.
Addison : - Please leave the room. - No. Wait.
Bex : Tell me what's wrong with me.
Bex : What is wrong with me?
UNK: Mrs. Singleton : Bex...
UNK: Mr. Singleton : We learned that your tumor...
UNK: Mr. Singleton : it's not compressing an ovary.
Bex : Then where is it?
UNK: Mrs. Singleton : It's on a testis.
Bex : Like a testicle?
Bex : - I have testicles? - Yes. One.
Addison : Bex, this is a tremendous amount of information...
UNK: Bex interrupts : And I've had it my whole life?
UNK: Bex interrupts : Oh, my God.
UNK: Does this mean...?
UNK: Bex interrupts : Does this mean I could be a boy?
Meredith : Yes.
UNK: Mrs. Singleton : You engineered that conversation. Forced our hand.
George : You were lying.
UNK: Mr. Singleton : - Protecting her. - She's a 14-year-old girl.
George : Maybe. Maybe not.
UNK: Mrs. Singleton : This isn't your life. This isn't your child!
UNK: Fourteen years. Fourteen years, we have raised a daughter.
UNK: Mrs. Singleton : In one afternoon, you expect us to... What? What is Bex to do?
UNK: Mrs. Singleton : How is she supposed to go home and tell the other kids? What? You had no right.
George : No. I know. I'm off the case, right?
Alex : Whoa, Mauer. Mauer.
Alex : Lay back. You just had surgery. You're losing your shirt, man.
Mauer : Much obliged... Much obliged, pal.
UNK: How you feeling?
Mauer : What's whacked for 20, Alex?
UNK: Weeds whacked weeds.
UNK: Weeds whacked for 200.
UNK: Way, way whacked.
Derek : - I saw Ellis. - And?
UNK: I think I can get her into the trial. She's a perfect candidate.
Richard : Excellent. Thank you, Derek.
UNK: It requires Meredith's power of attorney.
