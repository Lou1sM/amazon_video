Richard : Yang.
Cristina : Know what's wrong with having an 80-hour limit? It protects the weak.
Cristina : It levels the playing field. Which not only sucks, it's dangerous.
UNK: Eighty-hour work week? That's what's on your mind?
Bailey : I thought about it.
Bailey : - Not keeping it. - You did?
UNK: My husband and I, we tried for years.
Bailey : But still, when that stick turned blue...
Bailey : You can't work the way we work,
Bailey : you can't want the kind of careers that we want
Bailey : and not take... pause.
Bailey : I took pause.
Cristina : - You paused? - I paused. I paused a very long time.
UNK: So why did...?
Bailey : I sat up one night, middle of the night...
Bailey : and I knew I could do this.
Bailey : I still don't know how I'm gonna do this, but... I knew I could do it.
Bailey : You just have to know.
Bailey : And when you don't know, then no one can fault you for it.
Bailey : You do what you can, when you can, while you can.
Bailey : And when you can't, you can't.
Denny : - You're stalking me. You're a stalker. - Well, can you blame me?
UNK: So it's bad?
Izzie : - You have time. - Liar.
Izzie : - Fine. There's no time. - Now, that's just spiteful.
UNK: I didn't get the heart?
UNK: Izzie shakes her head slightly : You didn't get the heart.
MVO : - Hey. - Hey, George.
George : Hey, I just... I just wanted to check in on you.
Bex : Heard my parents weren't too happy with you.
George : Nope.
Bex : Thanks for telling me. For making them tell me.
UNK: George nods : You know, um, there are people that you can talk to.
Cristina : - I can... - I know.
UNK: Bex interrupts : - George, do I have to be a boy now? - No.
Izzie : - No. - But I can if I want to?
George : Yeah, you can. If you want.
UNK: Hey, could you...?
Bex : Would you bring me some scissors?
UNK: Who gets to determine when the old ends and the new begins?
UNK: Addison fed up : Derek.
Izzie : - Hi. - Tell me about the program.
UNK: It's not a day on a calendar, not a birthday, not a new year.
UNK: - Denny. I'll see you. - Goodbye, Dr. Stevens.
UNK: - Hey. He's leaving? - Didn't get the heart.
Addison : - Sorry. - Yeah.
Alex : - He's a good guy. - Yeah. He is.
UNK: It's an event. Big or small.
UNK: Something that changes us.
UNK: Ideally, it gives us hope.
UNK: A new way of living and looking at the world.
Derek : I'm cooking the trout outside.
UNK: Mrs. Singleton nods : Thank you.
Addison : Oh.
UNK: Derek sighs : There is a land called Passive-Aggressiva...
Addison : - and I am their queen. - That's all I'm saying.
UNK: Addison she takes the beer from him and takes a sip : So what? With Meredith...
UNK: Am I supposed to just wait it out? Wait until it passes?
Derek : That'd be good.
UNK: Addison nods : I still hate the trailer.
Derek : As is your right.
UNK: Letting go of old habits, old memories.
Cristina : I wasn't gonna have it. The baby. And you don't get to be mad about that.
Cristina : We barely knew each other. I was an intern.
Cristina : - There was no way... - I'm not mad.
UNK: Cristina appraises him : - You're not? - No.
Burke : I just wanted to know.
UNK: I want to know things.
UNK: What's important is that we never stop believing
UNK: we can have a new beginning.
UNK: Doc, that was my laundry. You don't eat laundry.
Meredith : Bad dog! Bad dog! Bad!
UNK: But it's also important to remember that amid all the crap
UNK: are a few things really worth holding on to.
