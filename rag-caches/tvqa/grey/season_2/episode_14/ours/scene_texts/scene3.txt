UNK: Oh, I don't use drugs. Don't need 'em.
UNK: Naomi smiling : I've got Tom.
UNK: Naomi smiling : He's my drug. Aren't you, baby?
Meredith : - She's high, Dr. Burke. - She's in love. She's happy.
Meredith : Nobody is that happy. She's on drugs.
UNK: Burke sighs : Run a tox screen. But Naomi doesn't strike me as a liar.
UNK: Burke sighs : If she says no drugs, then it's no drugs.
UNK: - You develop a sixth sense about this. - Everybody's a liar.
Burke : Dr. Grey, is that a dog?
UNK: Meredith shrugs : No.
Derek : We need to keep this elevated, OK?
UNK: I'm gonna check in on you in a little bit.
Bailey : Yang.
Derek : You were a little harsh in there.
UNK: He was lying. Your "harsh" is another man's "refreshing."
UNK: Well, he's in shock. He lost his fingers and his only remaining habit in one day.
Derek : We need to be compassionate.
UNK: Cristina looks upset : - Compassionate? - It's an emotion.
Derek : - Have you ever heard of it? - Have you?
CRISTINA : Barely back on her feet and you've got her calling you McDreamy again.
UNK: I was telling the patient the truth. You might want to try it sometime.
George : Remotes.
George : - More remotes. - O'Malley?
George : I'm getting a remote for Mrs. Larson.
Richard : What happened to the upper hand?
George : Have you met Mrs. Larson, sir?
Richard : Why do you think she's been here this long? In a private room.
UNK: George amused : She handled you, too?
UNK: Well, she sang for the troops, you know?
UNK: Can't we just keep her here until her room at her daughter's house is ready?
Richard : No, we can't.
Richard : Not on surgical service, anyway.
George : Oh. OK.
George : - But... some other service? - I'm the Chief, O'Malley.
Richard : I can't condone turfing patients onto other services.
Richard : You hear me, O'Malley?
UNK: Any available IC nurse to OR 2.
Sophie : I'm missing my program, Irish.
Sophie : And I don't see a remote in that hot little hand.
UNK: Your urine output has increased slightly since yesterday.
George : I'm going to have to take you to gynecology
George : to make sure you don't have a prolapsed uterus.
Sophie : Honey, my uterus hasn't been an issue for 30 years.
George : I know. But it might be an issue now.
George : You know, one that could keep you here in the hospital for tests.
Sophie : You drive. I'll ride shotgun.
Izzie : - You're not moving out, George. - Oh, yes, I am.
UNK: I gave an ultimatum. Threw down the gauntlet. I drew my line in the sand.
UNK: Well, un-give, un-throw, un-draw.
George : A man does not give an ultimatum and then back down.
George : Meredith had a choice and she chose the dog.
UNK: Sophie shocked : A girl chose a dog over you?
Sophie : - Yes. - No.
