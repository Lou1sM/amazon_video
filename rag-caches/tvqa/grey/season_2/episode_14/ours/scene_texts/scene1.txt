Debbie : and if you have a problem with that, take it up with the chief.
UNK: ~ Don't know why
UNK: ~ There's no sun up in the sky...
Richard : - Mrs. Larson's got to go. - If she refuses to go, what can I do?
Richard : She's 78 and non-ambulatory. You have the upper hand here. Use it.
Richard : Karev, can I talk to you for a second?
UNK: - Results of your Medical Board exams. - Thanks.
Izzie : - Aren't you going to open it? - Yeah, I'll open it.
UNK: ~ I'm weary all the time ~
Sophie : - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Mrs. Larson, I'm Dr. O'Malley.
UNK: Oh! An Irishman. I love the Irish. They have a sparkle.
Sophie : You can see it in the eye. And the swagger.
Sophie : Come on, Dr. O'Malley. Show me the swagger.
Sophie : The eyes are right,
UNK: but you'll have to work on the swagger.
Richard : - Mrs. Larson... - Call me Sophie.
Sophie : Now, be a doll and bring me a remote.
Sophie : This one's busted.
Sophie : Sophie.
UNK: I can't bring you one because you're no longer a patient at this hospital.
George : According to your chart, you have a room at the Sugar Maple Nursing Home.
Sophie : I'm staying until my daughter's house is ready.
Sophie : She's converting her den into my bedroom.
UNK: She's doing it in a shade of pink.
Sophie : Now... bring me a remote, Irish.
Sophie : I'm going to sing... until you get back.
UNK: ~ Can't go on
UNK: ~ Everything I have is gone
UNK: ~ Stormy weather...
George : Coming right up.
UNK: Yumi Miyazaki, 22. Presented this morning with persistent hiccups.
UNK: She was given 50 chlorpromazine which stopped them, but then they returned,
Izzie : so she needs a surgical consult to rule out esophageal perforation.
Bailey : - When did your hiccups start? - A few days ago.
UNK: Mr. Kamaji : - She doesn't speak English. - You her boyfriend?
UNK: Mr. Kamaji : Her coach.
UNK: - She's an athlete? - Yumi is a competitive eater.
Izzie : Eating is a sport?
UNK: Miyazaki. Yeah, yeah.
UNK: Alex nods : She's like a rock star in Japan.
Izzie : Again, eating is a sport?
UNK: Alex to Mr. Kamaji : Tell her I saw her on TV. Tell her I'm an athlete too. I'm a wrestler...
UNK: Mr. Kamaji to Alex : She wonders how a wrestler got smart enough to be a doctor.
UNK: Mr. Kamaji to Alex : Most wrestlers she knows are dumb.
UNK: Tell her she hasn't been hanging out at the right gyms.
