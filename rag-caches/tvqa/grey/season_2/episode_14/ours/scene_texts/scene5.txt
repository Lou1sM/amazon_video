Sophie : - Busted. - Put that out.
UNK: Band Mate : Sorry.
UNK: I've gotta prep you for surgery.
Cristina : Can you ask your friends to leave?
UNK: Love you.
Rick : I wasn't gonna light 'em. I was just holding them.
Cristina : OK.
UNK: - Seriously. Take them. Throw them out. - You hang on to them.
UNK: - Seriously, I wasn't gonna smoke. - I don't care. Do what you want.
Rick : You don't think I'm gonna be able to quit, do you?
Cristina : No. I don't.
UNK: ~ I'm lonely all the time...
George : Oh, no.
Debbie : Oh, yeah.
Sophie : Irish.
Sophie : That nice lady doctor in gynecology
Sophie : said that, since I had a hysterectomy back in '74,
Sophie : I don't have a uterus to prolapse.
UNK: George to himself : - Damn it. - I've been feeling a bit feverish.
Sophie : A woman my age with a fever could be an indication of...
Sophie : any number of awful diseases.
UNK: George disappointed : They took your temperature an hour ago. It was normal.
UNK: I am sorry, Sophie, but I am going to have to call your daughter.
Sophie : I'm telling you, I'm warm.
Sophie : That must be one hell of a dog.
George : Excuse me?
Sophie : With those eyes...
Sophie : and those nice firm hands.
Sophie : A girl who chooses a dog over you...
Sophie : It must be one hell of a dog.
Meredith : Mrs. Cline's tox screen and titer both came back negative.
Meredith : I was sure I was right about that.
UNK: Burke chuckles : Gonna have to adjust your world view.
UNK: - There are people who don't lie. - Maybe.
Burke : Although, frankly, the drug use would have explained the valve failure.
Meredith : - So how do we proceed? - Schedule Mrs. Cline for a surgery.
Cristina : OK.
Burke : Do you want to come over for dinner?
Alex : - What? - Dinner.
Burke : - Our place. Mine and Cristina's. - Why?
UNK: You're Cristina's friend. I want her to feel welcome to have our friends round.
Meredith : - So she moved in with you? - Yes. Didn't she tell you?
UNK: Meredith forces a smile : Of course she told me. Why wouldn't she tell me?
UNK: Meredith forces a smile : She's in, right?
UNK: Meredith forces a smile : - Which, you know, I think is great. - Right.
Meredith : Thank you.
UNK: I just came from Mr. Freeark's room.
UNK: He's convinced he won't be able to quit smoking. Says you agree.
Cristina : He asked my opinion.
Cristina : - Want me to apologize? - Tell him you're wrong.
Derek : You're having a bad day. Your favorite uncle died of lung cancer.
UNK: Say whatever you need to. Get him to believe this is about you, not him.
UNK: If he thinks he can't quit, he won't.
UNK: - Then we shouldn't do the surgery. - Fine.
Derek : - What is your problem? I'm your boss... - You're not right now.
UNK: Cristina interrupts : We're in an elevator, your specialty for McDreamy moments.
UNK: Derek warningly : - Dr. Yang... - For a moment I'm not Dr. Yang,
Cristina : you're not Dr. Shepherd. You're the guy who screwed up my friend.
Cristina : The guy who drove her to get a dog because her boyfriend lied...
UNK: Derek interrupts : I never lied to her.
Cristina : I know a liar when I see one because I'm a liar.
UNK: Want me to lie to the patient? Fine, I'll lie.
