Meredith : No. Don't.
Alex : - What? - Don't tell him.
Meredith : At least, not right now. Or tonight.
Meredith : I just mean wait. It can wait.
Meredith : I lied about Derek.
Meredith : We're not just friends.
Meredith : I mean, I'm not.
Meredith : He's still McDreamy.
Bailey : I know.
George : You don't get to choose.
Meredith : Huh?
George : I know you've been going through a bad time. I know you miss Shepherd.
UNK: And I know that your life has been admittedly pretty unpleasant these days.
George : You get points for breathing in and out. You get to be a little selfish.
George : But you don't get to choose a dog over me.
George : I'm George. I sleep down the hall from you.
George : I buy your tampons.
UNK: I have held your hand every time you've asked.
George : I've earned the right to be seen, to be respected,
George : to not have you think of me as less than a dog that you got at the pound.
UNK: Meredith shrugs : So...
George : I'm not moving out.
George : Whether you like it or not, I'm staying.
UNK: No matter how hard we try to ignore it or deny it,
UNK: eventually the lies fall away...
Burke : I'm glad you moved in.
Cristina : So am I.
UNK: ... whether we like it or not.
Meredith : OK, Doc. Let's go.
Derek : Hey, Doc. Hey, buddy.
Meredith : - Hey. - Welcome home.
Addison : He's beautiful.
Izzie : - I brought his toys. - Here's his food and his water dish.
Sophie : Here.
Meredith : Thanks for doing this. I know it's a lot to ask.
Addison : It's all right.
Addison : It's just a dog.
Addison : Right? Come on, Doc.
UNK: Izzie to Meredith : - We'll just... wait by the car. - OK.
UNK: So, he chews everything.
Meredith : So don't leave anything out.
Meredith : He hates cats and small, little, yappy dogs.
UNK: - Oh, not house-broken. - Oh.
UNK: - Probably should have told you that. - Yeah.
Meredith : You don't have to do this, you know?
UNK: Well, you know, I got all this land. It's just going to waste.
Cristina : Derek.
Addison : It's just a dog. It doesn't mean anything. He'll be fine.
Alex : Yeah.
UNK: - OK. Good night. - Good night.
UNK: But here's the truth about the truth :
UNK: It hurts.
UNK: So... we lie.
