Meredith : - Come on. - What should I put?

George : - Not helping. - Fine.
Cristina : Playful, protective puppy needs loving home.
Meredith : Good.
Meredith : - Hey, George. - Don't talk to me.
UNK: You'll mess up my game, and I'm in the zone.

UNK: Richard interrupts : The nurses again? Can't you do something?
UNK: Richard interrupts : You used to be one of them. Don't you speak "nurse?"
Patricia : That's why you don't get any respect from the nurses.
Patricia : - Surgical arrogance. - I'm not arrogant.
Patricia : You're killing them with that workload. Look at the board.
Richard : What? That's a beautiful board.
UNK: It's a crowded board. We need more nurses.
UNK: Mr. Kamaji? This is probably what's causing her hiccups.
Bailey : - A tear in the lining of her esophagus. - Can you fix it?
UNK: Yes, surgically. Sooner the better.
UNK: After today, her schedule is clear until March.
Bailey : No, her schedule is clear now. She can't compete today.
Bailey : And if she enjoys the taste of solid food,
Bailey : I recommend giving up the sport for something a little less aggressive.
Bailey : Say, boxing.
UNK: Mr. Kamaji : I see.
UNK: Mr. Kamaji : Could you give us some privacy please?
Bailey : Karev, get the translator up here.
Bailey : Let's make sure she's getting the whole truth.
Tom : - You know? - Yeah.
