UNK: Thank you for this, with the needles and blood.
Meredith : They won't accept her without a family history.
Derek : I'm happy to get your mom into the clinical trial.
Derek : Even with the needles and blood.
Derek : All done. How's that feel?
UNK: We lie to ourselves because the truth...
UNK: The truth freaking hurts.
UNK: It feels good.
UNK: Meredith interrupts : - Burke thinks you moved in with him? - It's not important.
UNK: - You're calling Derek "McDreamy" again? - It's nothing.
Cristina : - All right, what are you doing? - What are you doing?
Cristina : - Stop repeating what I say. - Stop asking me questions.
UNK: George yells : Cujo has to go!
Izzie : He peed on my bed. My bed, Meredith.
UNK: Meredith defensive : - He's our dog. - No, he's not my dog.
George : You two bought him without even asking me.
Meredith : We rescued him from certain death.
Meredith : Come on, you guys.
George : I'm putting my foot down. Either the dog moves out or I do.
George : Foot. Down. Now.
George : Me or the dog. Which is it?
UNK: - You hesitated. She hesitated. - You hesitated?
Meredith : I didn't hesitate. I was thinking.
UNK: You have to think about it? Fine.
George : I'm moving out right now.
George : Later. I'm moving out later. Because right now, I have rounds.
Bailey : - Tell me that is not a dog. - It's not a dog.
Bailey : - Let's go. - Rick Freeark, 29.
UNK: Severed three fingers on his left hand. Controlled the bleeding.
Tony : Vitals stable. Gave him five of morphine.
Bailey : - Fingers? - Had trouble retrieving them,
UNK: so we took off. Rig behind us found 'em. They're iced and ready.
UNK: - Ten minutes out. - Continue with IV fluids
Bailey : and start a course of antibiotics. Yang, wait outside for the fingers.
UNK: Can you sew them on?
UNK: They sewed that guy's penis back on after his wife chopped it off.
Bailey : Penises and fingers are like apples and oranges.
George : - How did it happen? - I was loading my gear on to the truck
UNK: for a gig and they got caught.
Alex : - You're a musician? - I play the guitar.
Rick : You can sew them back on, right? This is not that big a deal, right?
Rick : Oh, dude, I better not be out of the band.
Derek : The cuts look clean. That's good.
UNK: Clean severed makes reattachment easier.
Derek : I'm not going to lie to you. If the surgery is successful,
Derek : we're looking at a long recovery with lots of physical therapy.
Derek : - You smoke? - Why?
UNK: Cigarettes constrict blood vessels. I've seen grafts fail over a few cigarettes.
Rick : So what are you saying?
Rick : I smoke a cigarette after my operation and boom! My fingers fall off?
Cristina : No. First they turn black and necrotic and then they fall off.
Rick : Well... I don't smoke, so...
UNK: Really? Because judging by the nicotine stains, your fingers do.
Sophie : Anybody out there?
UNK: Hello?
Debbie : Don't look at me.
Debbie : She had hip replacement surgery a month ago and was discharged last week.
George : Then why is she still here?
Debbie : Because I am not a bouncer and this is not a nightclub.
UNK: I am doing what I can, with extremely limited staff and resources
