Jake : I'm really big on eyes.
UNK: They're the only part on my face where tumors aren't growing.
Cristina : - Yeah, you've got nice eyes. - Yeah?
UNK: You get that that I'm jailbait, right?
Meredith : - Meredith. - Chief.
Meredith : Chief. Can I ask you something, not work-related?
Burke : OK.
Meredith : Do you remember my father?
Richard : - Of course. - Do you know why he left?
Richard : I believe your mother asked him to.
Meredith : Right. But do you know why?
UNK: Richard shakes his head : No. No, I'm sorry, I don't.
UNK: Richard shakes his head : - Well, have a good day. - Thanks. You, too.
Derek : Dr. Yang, book an OR, please.
UNK: Mrs. Burton : How is that possible?
Mark : It's precision work. It won't be easy, but...
UNK: Derek interrupts : Dr. Sloan, can I help you with something?
Jake : He says he can fix my face.
Jake : He says he can make me look like normal.
Alex : - What did he say? Did you hear that? - Did he call him a crack whore?
Cristina : Oh, shut up. I'm trying to read lips.
Cristina : Shepherd's gesturing.
UNK: - What you got? - They're battling it out.
Cristina : - Oh, it's getting good. - Why? What you got?
George : Just a woman down in the ER...
George : having spontaneous orgasms.
UNK: Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!
UNK: Derek angry : - That is not the point! - The kid wants his face fixed!
UNK: No, you want to get published!
Mark : Yeah, and I'm guessing your Chief of Surgery does too.
UNK: The press loves a before-and-after shot, Richard.
UNK: Richard annoyed : Call me Dr. Webber.
Richard : Derek, out of friendship to you,
UNK: I would very much love to say no to this... jackass.
Richard : - But as Chief... - Please don't say it.
Richard : Dr. Sloan, if you can get the parents to sign a consent form...
Mark : Round two goes to the jackass.
Cristina : - Which one? Which one? - Twelve o'clock.
UNK: Oh! Oh, no.
UNK: Oh, it's happening.
UNK: - Doctors? There something you need? - No.
Addison : Well, in that case, move on.
Cristina : I don't get what McDreamy or McSteamy sees in her.
Alex : - She's McHot. - Mc Yeah she is.
Mark : You're not even a little bit happy to see me?
UNK: Go home. Whatever it is you came here to do, just drop it.
UNK: Hey, we all made mistakes, Addison. All three of us.
UNK: Mark continues ignoring Addison : Somehow I lost my best friend and the woman I loved.
Addison : Please... don't say that.
Mark : He doesn't know how we felt.
Mark : He doesn't know you stayed with me after he left?
