Burke : Oh, no.
UNK: Was that a...?
George : Did she just have a...?
Pamela : Orgasm.
Addison : Spontaneous orgasms?
Addison : - Are you sure? - Kind of hard to miss.
UNK: Ms. Calva, Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.
Pamela : It's Pamela.
UNK: Since we're talking about, you know, may as well get familiar.
Addison : Pamela, can you tell me how long this has been happening to you?
Pamela : - For a few months, I guess. - How often?
UNK: About... I don't know, seven or eight times a day.
UNK: - Every day? - Uh, Dr. Stevens.
UNK: I'm sorry. Every day?
UNK: Yes, every day.
Addison : And you haven't seen a doctor about this before?
UNK: - It's not something you want to cure. - Dr. O'Malley!
UNK: Sorry. Is it?
Pamela : I went to my doctor. He sent me to a shrink.
Addison : - And he didn't do any tests? - Pammy? You back here?
UNK: - Oh, God, no! You called my father? - Pammy?
George : He's your emergency contact person.
UNK: Mr. Calva : Pammy, what happened?
UNK: Mr. Calva : - You were in an accident? - I caused the accident, Dad.
UNK: - You had one of your...? - Episodes? Yeah.
Burke : Oh, no.
UNK: Dang it!
UNK: She's... a junior at U-Dub.
UNK: Mr. Calva tries to talk over it : She's a math major.
UNK: Last three semesters she made the honor roll.
UNK: Mr. Calva tries to talk over it : High up in the honor roll.
UNK: Mr. Calva, we're going to...
UNK: run some tests and we're going to...
UNK: Addison uncomfortable : figure out what's causing your daughter's...
Pamela : - Episodes. - That's right, episodes. OK.
UNK: And when you were 14, you stole Laura Brendese right out from under me.
Chuck : You knew how I felt about her, don't say you didn't, because you knew.
Chuck : And you went for her anyway.
Chuck : What kind of human being does that to his brother?
Meredith : He was 14. Cut him some slack for God's sakes!
Meredith : Oh, sorry. Forgot we were recording.
Chuck : If you wouldn't mind just rewinding a little bit, please.
Meredith : I'm a doctor, not a videographer, and I do need to prep you for surgery.
Chuck : - But you offered to help. - I thought you were saying goodbye.
Chuck : I am saying goodbye.
Chuck : None of these people, not one of them, knows how I really feel.
Chuck : My whole life, I've kept it all inside.
Chuck : I don't want to carry this with me to my grave.
Meredith : You seem like such a nice man.
UNK: Wouldn't you rather they remember you that way?
MVO : No.
UNK: Please rewind the tape?
Cristina : It can get a little cramped in there,
Cristina : so you have to try not to move.
Jake : Yeah, uh, this is like my 50th MRI experience.
Cristina : - Right, sorry. - That's OK.
Jake : You have really nice eyes.
Jake : I'm just saying that you're mostly all...
UNK: all surly and hardcore but your eyes aren't.
