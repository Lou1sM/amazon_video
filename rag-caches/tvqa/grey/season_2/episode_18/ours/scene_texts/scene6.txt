Mark : How do you expect to work out a marriage if you can't even be honest with him?
Addison : - Why are you here? - For one reason.
Mark : To bring you home.
Mark : I miss you, Addison.
Addison : I'm in love with my husband, Mark.
Mark : But he's not in love with you.
Mark : He's in love with that intern. And he's not even trying to hide it.
UNK: Why would you want to stick around for that?
Alex : - I think you're making it up. - He's not. I saw it four times.
Meredith : - What? - Woman with spontaneous orgasms.
UNK: - Uh-huh. - Really?
UNK: You're jealous because you didn't see it.
Alex : Totally am.
Addison : Spontaneous orgasms?
UNK: - You look nice today. - Any chance they're contagious?
Addison : Spontaneous orgasms, that would solve so many problems.
UNK: George chuckles : It would, it would. I think you smell nice, too.
Cristina : It's like, you see someone throw up, it makes you throw up, too.
UNK: Kind of like.
Izzie : You know what? I'm not hungry. Do you hear me? I'm not hungry!
UNK: - Neither is the beast! - The beast?
Cristina : Is that like some sly reference to your penis?
Alex : Get your mind out of the gutter, crack whore.
UNK: No, it's not Alex's penis. It's... when you haven't had sex for a long time
George : and you forget how good it is so you want it less?
Cristina : - That doesn't happen to me. - Me, neither.
UNK: Me, neither.
George : I grew my hair for her and...
UNK: Izzie joins in : - I know. - I don't think she's noticed.
Izzie : You could just try telling her how you feel.
UNK: Um... guys? She's moving. Like, a lot.
Izzie : Pamela, you have to hold still.
Burke : OK.
UNK: George amused : - That's not helping the beast sleep. - No. No, it's not.
UNK: You're drawing the medial to the tumor?
Izzie : Yeah.
UNK: It's a guideline for the bone structure.
Alex : You hear that? I'm going to have bone structure.
Cristina : Jake...
UNK: Mr. Burton : Could you stop doing that for a minute?
Cristina : Jake...
UNK: Mr. Burton : Jake, I'm sorry.
