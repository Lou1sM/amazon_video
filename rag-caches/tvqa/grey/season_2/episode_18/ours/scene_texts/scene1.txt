MVO : So...
UNK: Izzie smiles : as fun as it was, it's not going to happen again.
Alex : - Stop looking at me. - I'm not, I'm rounding.
Alex : - I'm rounding, too. - Fine.
Meredith : Chuck Eaton, 54, has stage 3B non-small-cell lung cancer
Meredith : with possible invasion of the pleura and a history of COPD.
Meredith : He's had extensive chemo-radiotherapy with minimal regression of the tumor.
Meredith : He's been admitted for radical en-bloc resection.
Chuck : I was a smoker.
UNK: The, uh, oncologist...
UNK: He explained that I have a 25 percent chance of surviving the surgery.
Burke : Well, unfortunately, that's about right.
Burke : If you should elect not to proceed, we can make you more comfortable.
UNK: With all due respect, uh...
UNK: there's no way that you can make a man dying a slow death comfortable.
Chuck : I'll roll the dice.
UNK: How do I look? Would you say I look nice?
Izzie : You could use a little more lip gloss.
UNK: - Aw! You're mean. - I'm just kidding. You look fine.
George : Seriously, how's my breath?
Izzie : - George, would you just talk to her? - Who? What?
UNK: Good morning, Dr. Bailey!
UNK: Hi, baby!
UNK: - Are the ORs up and running? - Fully functional.
UNK: There is some smoke damage.
UNK: How about you? Are you fully functional?
UNK: Meredith nods : I'm fine. How's your husband?
UNK: Takin' him home tomorrow.
UNK: - Yes, we are. Yes. Yes. - I know you're so cute. I know you are.
UNK: OK, this is not a tea party.
UNK: Go! Work! Save some lives!
Bailey : Now!
Cristina : Jake Burton, 15, has advanced craniodiaphyseal dysplasia,
UNK: admitted after complaining of headaches.
UNK: Mrs. Burton : - He's not a complainer. - He's been having some nausea.
UNK: Really? OK. So, may I, please?
UNK: Jake, can I get you to sit up?
Meredith : - Sure. - All right. OK.
UNK: Now I want you to look right here for me. Thank you.
UNK: You know, if you pretend I'm a lion, it helps.
Cristina : Sorry?
UNK: If you pretend I'm a lion, instead of a messed-up kid,
Jake : you get a talking circus animal, which is way easier to look at.
Derek : What's our immediate concern?
Cristina : That the bony tumors are encroaching on his brain.
UNK: Invasive non-small-cell with a history of COPD?
Mark : That guy's pretty much a goner.
Meredith : Sensitivity. I like that in a stranger.
Meredith : - Are you new here? - Visiting.
Mark : Confounded by all the rain and it's only my first day in town.
Meredith : - You get used to it. - Makes me want to stay in bed all day.
