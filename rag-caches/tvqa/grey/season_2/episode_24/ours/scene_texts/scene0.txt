Meredith : - So, uh, I don't cook. - Nobody asked you to cook.
Meredith : I know, I'm just saying that, you know, I don't cook, so you don't have to cook.
Meredith : I don't expect you to cook for me.
Finn : OK. You. Sit there.
Finn : Sit down.
Finn : I want you to drink this
Finn : and try really hard to act like you aren't scary and damaged.
Meredith : I'm not scary and damaged.
Finn : - Yeah, you are. - No. I'm not scary or damaged.
Finn : Mm-hmm. All right. Why don't you tell me about your family?
Meredith : OK.
Meredith : Me not wanting to talk about my family, does not make me scary or damaged.
Meredith : OK.
Finn : Tell me about the last guy you slept with.
UNK: The problem is trying to figure out how to control the damage we have done.
UNK: Or that's been done to us.
Izzie : - What did you say to him? - Nothing. I fled the scene.
Izzie : You didn't tell him about George or Derek?
Finn : - No. - Hmm. You like him.
Meredith : - I could like him. - Is the sex any good?
Meredith : I don't know.
Izzie : Four dates and two sleepovers at his place and no sex?
Meredith : Not even a kiss good night.
Izzie : Oh, I am proud.
Izzie : I am like a proud mama.
Meredith : Shut up.
Callie : Morning.
UNK: Sometimes the damage catches us by surprise.
Meredith : Oh, my God. Did that just happen?
Izzie : I'm having a seizure. I am clearly mid-seizure. I'm seizing.
Meredith : - Oh, my God. - She didn't even wash her hands.
Meredith : Oh, my God.
UNK: Sometimes we think we can fix the damage.
UNK: All I'm saying is if she needs to pee she could at least wear a bra.
Izzie : Or maybe wait until she's alone.
UNK: For the love of sanitation, could she wash her hands? She's a surgeon.
UNK: You said you were blocking the sink. I think you're exaggerating.
Izzie : She peed. Naked peeing. Ask Meredith. Meredith?
Izzie : That's right, I forgot, you're not talking to her.
George : - Oh! - She'd say Callie crosses the line.
Izzie : So crossed the line. So freaking crossed.
UNK: Oh. We're still pretending that you're not seeing a patient, right?
Cristina : People, what's with all the evil misery? Huh? Live and let live.
George : - You're cheerful. - Oh, come on.
Izzie : You are. How's that possible?
UNK: I scrubbed in on a four-hour paraesophageal hernia last night.
Cristina : Then I got laid.
Cristina : And now, three ambulances are coming in full of bloody broken car crash victims,
Cristina : all who need to be cut open.
Cristina : So, I'm cheery!
UNK: And sometimes the damage is something we can't even see.
Cristina : I'm cheerful!
Cristina : Sorry, sir, I...
Meredith : - Hey. - How's my dog?
Meredith : - Better. Finn's running tests. - Good.
Meredith : - Our dog. - What?
UNK: Our dog. You said "my dog. " He's our dog.
Derek : - Yeah, whatever. - Are you mad at me or something?
Derek : Now's not the time.
UNK: 25-year-old restrained driver, Noah Reynolds.
