Burke : No. No. Not just like me. I am a person first.
Izzie : Someone page me? Denny?
Nurse : He collapsed.
Marshall : What happened?
Denny : - Too far, too fast. - What were you doing?
Denny : Stairs.
Denny : - Real bright, huh? - Your LVAD battery is almost dead.
Izzie : Um, get him to his room, I'll get Dr. Burke.
Nurse : Let's get him up now. Nice and easy on one, two, three.
Burke : Now, Denny, you knew that LVAD wasn't a cure.
Denny : I want to go home. I want to go home yesterday.
Burke : I know this is hard to hear, but that's just not an option at this point.
Denny : Since when do you get to decide what's an option in my life and what isn't?
Denny : My heart may be on your battery packs, but it's still my heart.
Denny : It's my decision. It's my damn life.
Izzie : That's right.
Burke : It is your life.
Burke : And it is your life that is at stake.
UNK: And it is your life that will end if you continue to push like you did today.
Denny : You said the LVAD would make me better.
Burke : I told you the LVAD would buy you more time. And it will.
UNK: If you respect its limitations and your own.
Denny : I want to go home.
Izzie : What do we do?
Burke : We put him on a tight leash.
Burke : Tell the nurses to keep an eye on him.
Burke : Make sure he doesn't take any more endurance hikes in the stairwell.
UNK: Yeah. But... Preston, what do we do?
Burke : The damage to his body we can try to control, but the damage to his spirit...
Burke : For a man like Denny to lie on this bed for years on end...
Burke : That's not something we could really understand.
Burke : And his feelings about it aren't something we should try to control.
Burke : Give him room, Izzie. Just give him room to grieve.
Cristina : - You finally got Melanie to shut up? - Finally. Thanks for that.
Bailey : - How's she doing? - Images coming up now.
Cristina : - Ooh, is that a teardrop fracture? - No head bleed, though. That's good.
Cristina : - Look at her lungs. - Is that her liver?
UNK: - Whoa! - How is she alive?
Bailey : Karev, page Shepherd, Burke, Montgomery-Shepherd, the Chief
Bailey : and every surgeon with an available hand and get an OR opened.
Bailey : Go! Melanie? Mel...
Bailey : Get me a stretcher. Let's pull her out of there now!
Bailey : Melanie?
Callie : Hey, have you seen Izzie?
Callie : She was supposed to prep an OR for Noah's surgery and she bailed.
Derek : What?
George : - Mr. And Mrs. Johnson? - Dr. O'Malley!
Millie : That little girl right there says she's going to fix Noah's leg all by herself.
Millie : And she just gave him a big old shot for his pain. I really like her.
George : Mr. And Mrs. Johnson? Big Jim?
Millie : - Is it Mel? - Yes, ma'am, it is.
Jim : What? What?
George : When your daughter came into the OR,
George : her body was over-pumping her bloodstream with adrenaline,
George : which kept her conscious and alert and, uh, pain-free.
UNK: During the CT scan, she was still for a longer period of time
UNK: and so her body relaxed.
George : And the adrenaline stopped flowing, which allowed her to succumb
George : to the full extent of her injuries, which...
George : They're catastrophic.
Millie : Excuse me?
Bailey : Bovie.
Richard : More suction here. Clamp.
Burke : Internal saw.
