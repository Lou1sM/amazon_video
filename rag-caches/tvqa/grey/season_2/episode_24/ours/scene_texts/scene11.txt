Bailey : Oh, she's still bleeding pretty profusely.
Bailey : Hmm. I can't get it controlled.
Cristina : Burke?
Burke : She's not coming back.
Richard : Let's stop.
UNK: Time of death, 19 : 48.
Bailey : Chief?
UNK: I am sorry.
Izzie : I am...
UNK: I am so...
UNK: so sorry.
Cristina : Please.
UNK: You're going to get in trouble.
Derek : I don't care.
Denny : I'm not going to cheer up for you.
Izzie : You don't have to cheer up.
Izzie : I'm not here for me.
Izzie : I'm here for you. OK?
Meredith : OK.
UNK: We're all damaged, it seems.
UNK: Some of us more than others.
Burke : You must be tired.
Finn : Yeah.
Burke : I'm tired too.
UNK: We carry the damage with us from childhood.
UNK: Then, as grown-ups, we give as good as we get.
Addison : Good work, Karev.
Alex : Yeah. Kid's alive. Without a mother.
UNK: Ultimately, we all do damage.
George : See you at home?
Finn : Yeah.
George : - OK. See you. - OK.
UNK: And then...
UNK: we set about the business of fixing... whatever we can.
Callie : Izzie?
Izzie : Hmm?
Denny : Would it be wrong for me to feel you up right now?
Izzie : Hmm. Not so much.
Izzie : Such a dirty boy.
Meredith : - I know. - Hmm.
UNK: I washed my hands. I... I went down to the kitchen and I washed my hands.
Callie : I didn't wash my hands in the bathroom
Callie : because those girls were staring at me like I was a rodent or something.
Callie : Like I was in high school and I was... having the naked dream,
Callie : only it was actually happening.
Callie : I didn't even know they were home.
Callie : I washed my hands.
Callie : You have to stand up for me.
Callie : You have to say I washed my hands.
Millie : I'm sorry.
UNK: You're driving me crazy with the hovering.
Meredith : This could be a mistake.
Meredith : This. Us.
UNK: You're a really nice guy and... well...
UNK: you... you don't want to get involved with me.
Meredith : - If you knew me... - Scary.
Meredith : - Finn. - And damaged. See? I told you.
Meredith : If you knew me? If you knew my family?
Meredith : If I told you the guys that I've slept with lately?
UNK: The scary and damage may actually be more than you can handle.
Finn : My mother's dead.
Finn : She got cancer when I was ten and she suffered for a really long time.
Finn : And then she died.
Finn : And my father never recovered.
Finn : It's kind of like he died with her,
UNK: except that his body's above-ground and permanently placed in front of the TV
Finn : with a bottle of Scotch in his lap.
Finn : The last woman I slept with was my wife, but she died too.
Finn : It was a car crash, so it was quick.
Finn : She didn't suffer, which I appreciated.
Richard : Don't worry.
Finn : I'm thinking that my luck is beginning to change because I've met you.
Finn : And you like dogs and you enjoy pony births,
Finn : and you have the ability to save lives.
Finn : I never said I wasn't scary and damaged too.
