UNK: I... I didn't know you were awake.
Noah : - What did you do? - Uh, has...
George : Has anyone talked to you about your wife? About what's happening?
Noah : What's happening? Uh...
Noah : You know, I can't really, uh, wrap my brain around what's happening.
Noah : You know, I'm from here. Uh, Seattle.
UNK: And, uh... you know, I go away to college
Noah : and I come back
Noah : married to this big-haired, drawling Southern girl.
Noah : And everyone I know thinks I'm crazy.
Noah : But I love her.
UNK: I just... I love her.
UNK: And, uh... what's happening
UNK: is that my... big-haired Southern girl
Noah : could be dying.
UNK: And... I can't think about that.
Noah : You know, I need... I need to think about something else.
UNK: I mean, it doesn't... matter so much.
Noah : Something that doesn't... doesn't have me
Noah : burying my 22-year-old wife and baby.
Noah : So, uh, so...
Noah : What the hell did you do?
George : I believed my friend when she told me that Dr. Torres doesn't wash her hands.
Noah : Well, I hope that's not true.
Noah : Seeing as she just, uh... performed surgery on me and all.
Finn : Yeah.
Derek : - You paged me. - CT results.
Derek : Good, thank you. All right, let's see what we've got here.
Derek : Marshall, everything checks out fine.
Derek : Your short-term memory loss was a result of the concussion.
Derek : But to be safe, I want to keep you here overnight for observation, all right?
Marshall : I have to apologize.
Derek : What?
Marshall : To the woman's family.
Marshall : I have to tell them I'm sorry for what I did.
Derek : You should get some rest.
Meredith : I never should have told you about George.
Derek : No, it's fine, I'm glad I know. About him.
Derek : And the vet. You really get around.
Meredith : - What did you just say to me? - It's unforgivable.
Meredith : I don't remember ever asking you to forgive me.
Derek : So was the knitting a phase? Who's next? Alex?
Derek : Because I hear he likes to sleep around.
Derek : You two have that in common.
Meredith : You don't get to call me a whore.
Meredith : When I met you, I thought I had found the person
Meredith : that I was going to spend the rest of my life with! I was done.
Meredith : So all the boys and all the bars and all the obvious daddy issues, who cared?
Meredith : Because I was done.
Meredith : You left me. You chose Addison.
Meredith : I'm all glued back together now.
Meredith : I make no apologies for how I chose to repair what you broke.
Meredith : You don't get to call me a whore.
UNK: This thing with us is finished. It's over.
Cristina : Finally.
Derek : - Yeah. It's done. - It is done.
Cristina : Her temperature is 95.4 degrees and her pH is 7.28.
Burke : Definitely clotting better.
Burke : But some of the wounds are still oozing.
Richard : Well, still a fine line. She may not be quite stable enough.
Millie : Y'all don't have to whisper. I'm sitting right here. I can hear you anyway.
Millie : And she's my baby.
Millie : She's my little girl.
Millie : It's a big decision like this.
UNK: Going back in. Sewing up her... organs.
Millie : It's the kind of decision that a mama ought to be involved in.
Millie : I mean, all her life, she's asked me everything.
UNK: From... what color dress she ought to wear to her kindergarten dance
Millie : to what she ought to name her baby.
Millie : Because I'm her mama.
Millie : And it's my job to have an opinion. It's my job to have an answer.
Millie : I may not have an answer here, but... I'm still her mama.
Millie : You just don't have to whisper.
Finn : All right.
Richard : What do you think, Dr. Bailey?
Bailey : I think if we wait much longer she'll go into multiple organ failure.
Richard : OK. If it's all right with you, Mrs. Johnson,
Richard : we think it's time to go and finish what we started.
Derek : OK. I'm done.
UNK: Yang. Come and start washing out the abdominal cavity.
