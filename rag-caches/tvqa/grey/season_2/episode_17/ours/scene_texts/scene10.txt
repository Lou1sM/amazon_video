UNK: Tucker smiling : Hello, my little man.
UNK: Tucker smiling : Hello.

Izzie : There's someone at the door for you.
MVO : Hey.
MVO : Hey.
Derek : You almost died today.
Meredith : Yeah. I almost died today.
Richard : I can't...
Meredith : I can't remember our last kiss.
Meredith : All I could think about was, "I can't remember our last kiss,"
Meredith : which is pathetic, but...
Meredith : the last time we were together and happy, I...
Meredith : want to be able to remember that.
Meredith : And I can't, Derek.
UNK: I can't remember it.
Derek : I'm glad you didn't die today.
Derek : It was a Thursday morning.
Derek : You were wearing that ratty little Dartmouth t-shirt you look so good in.
Derek : The one with the hole in the back of the neck.
Derek : You'd just washed your hair and you smelled like some kind of...
Derek : flower.
Derek : I was running late for surgery.
UNK: You said you were going to see me later.
UNK: Then you leaned to me.
Derek : You put your hand on my chest...
Derek : and you kissed me.
Cristina : Soft.
Derek : It was quick. Kind of like a habit.
Derek : You know, like we'd do it every day for the rest of our lives.
Derek : You went back to reading the newspaper and I went to work.
Derek : That was the last time we kissed.
Meredith : Lavender.
Meredith : My hair smelled like lavender.
Meredith : From my conditioner.
Meredith : Lavender.
UNK: Derek nods : Huh.
UNK: If you knew this was your last day on Earth...
UNK: how would you want to spend it?
