UNK: Izzie upset : jealous, and now...
UNK: Izzie upset : I was jealous, Alex.
Meredith : Is this the strangest thing to happen in your OR?
UNK: Burke nods : - I'd have to say that it is. - Good, because I'm very competitive.
Burke : All the best surgeons are.
George : Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd talked to the chief.
UNK: She's on the phone with Mercy West now
UNK: - to see if they have any ORs. - I need someone to drive me home.
UNK: They're talking about doing a C-section.
UNK: Let them talk. I'm not going to Mercy West.
Bailey : This baby is not coming out. I need a ride.
Bailey : I can't focus enough to drive myself
Bailey : and Tucker...
Bailey : - I need a ride. - You could lose it.
UNK: I told you, I'm not having this baby until tomorrow.
UNK: - It could die before it's even born! - Can you give me a ride home?
George : - Dr. Bailey... - Then get out!
Mindy : Is there any news?
UNK: What? Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Carlson.
Mindy : My husband. I was wondering if there was any news.
Mindy : Because you look so worried.
Mindy : And I heard this doctor saying
UNK: even though that girl has her finger on the tear in his heart...
UNK: that my husband's losing... blood.
Mindy : Every second he's losing blood.
Mindy : Which means he could die.
Mindy : He could die?
Mindy : I ask because I know you'll tell me the truth.
Mindy : Because you look so worried.
Richard : Mrs. Carlson...
UNK: Yes, it's possible that he could bleed out and die if we don't operate soon.
MVO : OK.
MVO : OK.
UNK: Mindy nods : Thank you for telling me the truth.
UNK: Mindy nods : I'll just...
UNK: Mindy nods : I'll just go wait... over here.
UNK: Will somebody get me an update?
UNK: Richard yells out : And where's the head of the bomb squad?
Dylan : I'm right here. And we're good to go.
Dylan : My team's in place, Dr. Burke is ready.
UNK: The patient is stable.
Dylan : We can have the bomb out in ten minutes if I'm not interrupted.
Richard : In the OR we put our patients under general anesthesia.
Burke : - Yeah. - That involves a steady flow of oxygen.
Dylan : Well, can't you turn off the oxygen to my OR?
Richard : I can and I have.
Richard : But... this is your OR.
UNK: This is the OR floor's main oxygen line.
Izzie : It's going to be OK.
Izzie : - You don't know that. - It's just what you say.
George : I know.
Alex : - Where you going? - I can't just...
UNK: I got to do something to help.
UNK: Mindy nods : Thank you... for saying that it's going to be OK.
UNK: Even if it is just what you say.
Meredith : Stop it.
Meredith : - I'm not a patient. - What?
UNK: You two are looking at me the way we look at patients.
