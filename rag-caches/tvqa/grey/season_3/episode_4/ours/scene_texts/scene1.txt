UNK: - My Shawny could sell anything. - Yeah, I believe he can.
UNK: What he can't sell me on is going back to work
UNK: before he gets his oxygen levels up.
UNK: So you put that oxygen back on, Mr. Sullivan,
UNK: before I think about letting you out of here.
UNK: You know, if I do, I want your word.
UNK: Nothing fried, no alcohol and no cigarettes.
UNK: What? You're tough, Miranda.
BAILEY : I need your word, or I'm not gonna sign those papers.
UNK: MR. SULLIVAN : - I give you my word. - Hmm. All right, then.
UNK: Mrs. Sullivan, go to the front desk to fill out paperwork.
UNK: Then you can take your husband home.
UNK: How we doing?
UNK: She's at eight centimeters. Baby's at minus three station.
Husband : So, what do we do? Patterned breathing? Squatting?
ALEX : Dude, squatting?
ADDISON : Dr. Karev, how do we normally proceed in a situation like this?
ALEX : We monitor the baby's progress, and if the descent stops entirely
UNK: during active labor, we perform a C-section.
WIFE : Not on me, you don't.
WIFE : I'm sorry, Dr. Karev, but Jeff and I have a natural birth plan.
UNK: Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd promised us...
UNK: I promised that we would do what we can, but if your labor intensifies
ADDISON : - and the baby doesn't descend... - Then we'll wait until he does. Right?
WIFE : I'm not having a C-section.
UNK: A C-section is the safest way to...
UNK: - To what? Avoid a lawsuit? - We don't have to decide now.
UNK: I'm not gonna miss out on an experience my body was made for,
WIFE : just because it's more convenient for you.
UNK: You all right, Dr. Grey?
MEREDITH : Yeah, Dr. Bailey. I just...
MEREDITH : ...need to make a choice is all.
DEREK : Karev. Dr. Grey, I am clipping a basilar tip aneurysm. Any interest?
UNK: Dr. Bailey, can I get...?
ADDISON : Oh, my God.
ADDISON : - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.
GEORGE : - Is that...? - McSteamy.
ALEX : What...?
GEORGE : No, Mr. Sullivan, don't light that!
DEREK : - Get a fire extinguisher! - Call a code red!
