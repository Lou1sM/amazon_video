UNK: Actually, there is one more thing : Bone dry cappuccino.
MARK : Make it a double.
MEREDITH : - You're a good friend. - You're so high right now.
MEREDITH : You're my best friend in the whole entire world.
CHRISTINA : - Now I just feel sorry for you. - Why?
UNK: Because I could die today?
CHRISTINA : This is why I hate being around stoned people.
UNK: And if I did die today, I'd only be remembered
MEREDITH : as the slutty intern who dated two doctors.
UNK: No, one doctor. One vet.
UNK: Derek, Finn. Derek or Finn.
UNK: I'd die as the girI who couldn't make a choice, right?
CHRISTINA : Probably, but none of that matters because you'll be dead.
BAILEY : Dr. Grey, you've got a fever, high white count,
BAILEY : and tenderness over McBurney's point, which suggests...
UNK: CHRISTINA AND GEORGE : - Appendicitis. - Appendicitis.
BAILEY : Dr. O'Malley, prep Dr. Grey. You're scrubbing in.
GEORGE : I am? On Meredith's appendectomy?
UNK: Am I the only who remembers the last time George scrubbed in
MEREDITH : on an appendectomy?
MEREDITH : He almost killed the guy. Sorry, George.
GEORGE : I don't have to scrub in, Dr. Bailey. I could just...
GEORGE : Unless you want me to, which, you know...
UNK: - Not gonna happen again. - Good enough for you, Dr. Grey?
MEREDITH : You're pretty.
UNK: George! Ice chips!
MEREDITH : - Hey. - I heard Meredith's having an appy.
GEORGE : It wasn't my idea to scrub in.
UNK: - I tried to get out of it. - George! I was just...
UNK: I thought maybe we could have a late supper at the Archfield.
GEORGE : Why would we have dinner at a hotel?
UNK: Because they bring it right to your room.
GEORGE : You're staying at the Archfield. How are you affording that?
CALLIE : I still have some secrets, O'Malley.
CALLIE : And if you come see me tonight, I just might show you one or two.
UNK: I was checking on the Sullivans. How is he doing?
MARK : - You are? - Dr. Bailey. We met this morning.
BAILEY : I was the resident on Mr. Sullivan's bypass.
MARK : I don't need a resident on this case.
BAILEY : I wasn't asking to be your resident. I was asking how my patient was doing.
UNK: He's not your patient anymore.
UNK: Hey, so congratulations. I told you.
CHRISTINA : - Yeah. - What? What?
BURKE : Shepherd shouldn't have cleared me.
UNK: Burke, you're back and you're fine.
CHRISTINA : - Burke? - What?
ALEX : What?
BURKE : He just shouldn't have cleared me.
NURSE : Another contraction, Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.
ADDISON : You're fully dilated, but the baby's only at minus two station.
UNK: - He needs more time. - We don't have it.
UNK: His heart rate's slowing with each contraction.
UNK: - If he starts having late decels... - Is he having late decels?
ADDISON : Not yet, but...
UNK: Well, stop trying to scare me into an operation I told you I don't want.
REBECCA : I have a birth plan.
