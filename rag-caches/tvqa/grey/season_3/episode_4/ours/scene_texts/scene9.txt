UNK: MR. SULLIVAN : - Thank you. - You're welcome.
BAILEY : The appendix is out.
BAILEY : Now what do I do, O'Malley?

UNK: OK, clamp.
MARK : Where's my coffee, Karev?

MEREDITH : - Finn. - Derek.
DEREK : - She's still in surgery. - Yeah. I figured I'd wait here.
FINN : - Meredith tells me that you fish. - She does?
FINN : She tells me a lot of things.
FINN : Have you been up to Cornet Bay?
UNK: - It's mostly Chinook, some rockfish... - You fish?
UNK: Yeah, as much as I can.
FINN : - My wife hated it. - You had a wife?
FINN : Yeah. She died.
DEREK : I'm sorry. I didn't know.
FINN : Meredith doesn't tell you a lot of things. Only me.
UNK: Funny. Very funny.
FINN : You know, when I heard that she was sick, I...
FINN : People come through appendectomies all the time.
UNK: She'll be fine, right?
DEREK : - You really like her, don't you? - Yeah.
DEREK : - You're a good guy. - Yeah, I think so.

UNK: I'll see you.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : It was doctor after doctor.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : Everybody had a different opinion.

UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : Before that, Denny had never been sick a day in his life.
UNK: Before that, he had been...
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : You know, the thought of having to bury your own son.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : His mother and I, we didn't handle it very well.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : One day we came home and found a note...
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : ...saying he didn't want us to have to watch him die.
UNK: Then he left.
UNK: We thought... We thought he was dead all this time.
IZZIE : I had no idea.
UNK: Believe me, if I had known, I would've never let him get away with that.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : I believe it.
IZZIE : I worked my way through med school.
MEREDITH : - You... - I paid off my debt.
UNK: Look, I'm sorry about before. You don't have to explain.
UNK: I do. I do.
IZZIE : You're his dad and you're trying to protect him,
IZZIE : and I want you to know that I've paid off my debt.
IZZIE : And when I met Denny, I was going to be a surgeon,
IZZIE : so I didn't need his money.
IZZIE : I had everything I needed.
IZZIE : I had everything I needed until...
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : We miss him.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : - God, we miss him. - Yeah.
IZZIE : I, um...
CHRISTINA : Yeah.
IZZIE : - What is this? - It's for you.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : It's from Denny.
UNK: Hey. You ready to go?
GEORGE : I'm sorry I have to do this. I have to go home.
GEORGE : It's Izzie.
CALLIE : It's always Izzie or Meredith. It's... It's never me.
UNK: Oh. That is not true.
CALLIE : Who am I to you, George? Am I your girlfriend?
CALLIE : Am I somebody you mess around with?
CALLIE : Do you even know?
CALLIE : Well, guess what? Now you don't have to bother figuring it out.
BAILEY : How's he doing, Mrs. Sullivan?
UNK: MRS. SULLIVAN : We're just getting an update now, Dr. Bailey.
UNK: The surgery went well.
MARK : We removed the necrotic tissue, applied the live cells and,
MARK : if his body responds, in three or four weeks...
UNK: He'll have his face back?
MARK : Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan,
MARK : your face may never be exactly what it was.
UNK: Even if everything goes well, there will be scarring.
UNK: But he's a salesman.
UNK: MRS. SULLIVAN : He has such a nice face.
BAILEY : You have an incredible wife, Mr. Sullivan,
UNK: and a half a dozen car salesmen in the lobby waiting to visit you.
BAILEY : Your face may be different, but you know as well as I do
BAILEY : it's not about what you look like, or your job, or how successful you are.
