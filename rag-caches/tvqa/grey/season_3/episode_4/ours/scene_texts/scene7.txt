MARK : If what happened between me and Addison is so unforgivable,
MARK : how do you justify you and Meredith?
IZZIE : - What are you talking about? - Want me to be the bad guy, fine.
MARK : But I'm not the only bad guy here. You and me? We're the same.
UNK: Addison! Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd?
UNK: - You bellowed, Dr. Grey? - Hi.
UNK: You certainly are, aren't you?
ADDISON : But you're not pregnant.
MEREDITH : No.
UNK: - Are you OK? - Fine.
ADDISON : How are you?
MEREDITH : I'm trying to choose between two men.
UNK: OK. Well... Good luck with that.
MEREDITH : How did you know Derek was the one?
FINN : Excuse me?
MEREDITH : I know you hate me and all,
MEREDITH : and you don't owe me anything.
BURKE : Nothing.
MEREDITH : No... thing.
MEREDITH : - What was I saying? - Derek.
GEORGE : Right.
MEREDITH : I want him to be the one.
UNK: But I would know if he was the one, right? You knew, right?
CALLIE : You don't...
UNK: I didn't... know. I just...
ADDISON : Derek's the kind of guy...
ADDISON : I just knew he wouldn't hurt me.
ADDISON : Not on purpose, anyway. Not the way I hurt him.
MEREDITH : He hurt me.
MEREDITH : - When he chose you. - I should've let him go.
ADDISON : I should have stepped aside, been a better person.
GEORGE : I should have...
ADDISON : A lot of things.
MEREDITH : Me too. A lot of things.
ADDISON : I don't hate you.
MEREDITH : How come we never talked like this before?
ADDISON : The only reason we are talking like this right now
ADDISON : is because I know you won't remember a single word of this
UNK: once the drugs wear off.
NURSE : - Dr. Karev, you need to see this. - I'm off the case.
UNK: - Page Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd. - We did, but...
ALEX : Oh, man.
DEREK : Were you just talking to Meredith?
CHRISTINA : Yeah.
ALEX : What?
ADDISON : Don't, um...
ADDISON : Don't hurt her again.
ALEX : You planning on killing a woman today?
UNK: The C-section you should've performed on Rebecca Bloom this morning?
ALEX : It may be too late, for her and the baby.
ALEX : Nice work, doc.
UNK: Get an OR and an anesthesiologist. We're doing a crash C-section right away.
UNK: What is happening?
UNK: Your baby is having late decels. He's in distress.
ADDISON : We have to get you into the delivery room and get him out now.
UNK: - No, please. - This is no longer a conversation.
UNK: I am your doctor. I am responsible for your life and your baby's life
ADDISON : and I am not about to lose either one of you. Are we clear?
