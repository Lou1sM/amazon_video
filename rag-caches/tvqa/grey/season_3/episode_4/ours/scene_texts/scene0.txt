BURKE : I need more chickens.
CHRISTINA : No more chickens.

GEORGE : - Why is that? - Because she's hot.
UNK: - Callie. Hey! Come on. Wait! - Uh-uh.
GEORGE : Before you start yelling, you were right.
UNK: I should've told you how I felt about you moving in.
GEORGE : Not that you were moving in.
UNK: It's just I'm not good at the whole talking about feelings thing.

UNK: You don't seem to have trouble talking to them, but me?
