MARK : Make sure he has an airway. Sir, can you hear me?
UNK: - Sir! - No, he's out. Hit his head.
BAILEY : Small hematoma in the occipital region.
MARK : Get him to the burn unit until he's stabilized and get a CT.
MARK : - Go! - Right away, doctor. Come on.
DEREK : - You're burning up. - I'm fine.
UNK: You don't look fine. You look beautiful, but you don't look fine.
CHRISTINA : - Now I'm going to throw up. - You have aneurysms to clip.
MEREDITH : - And surgeons to confront. - You gonna be all right?
UNK: - Yeah. I'm fine. - Look after her, please.
UNK: Mm-hmm. You think I'd miss this?
UNK: What idiot lights a cigarette in a hospital?
DEREK : Apparently, people do idiotic things all the time.
UNK: Chief! Chief!
ADDISON : I thought you were going back to New York.
MARK : - I thought it was time for a change. - You can't do this. You can't be here.
MARK : Sure, I can. It was easy.
UNK: I sublet the apartment, sold the practice.
DEREK : He is a liar and a cheat.
UNK: He's one of the finest plastic surgeons.
UNK: He'll generate twice the revenue neurosurgery does.
UNK: Money? That's why he's here?
MARK : - Why do you think I'm here? - This is why I left you.
MARK : - Thought you left me for Derek. - I left New York because of him.
CHIEF : He was your best friend. For years.
UNK: - Up until he had sex with my wife. - We all make mistakes.
CHRISTINA : Holy crap. Are you pregnant?
UNK: Well, this is just perfect.
ADDISON : An adulterous love child.
DEREK : Goes along with an adulterous sociopath.
CHRISTINA : Meredith.
UNK: - Uh-uh. You've done enough already. - Meredith.
UNK: Oh, doctor? I finished filling out the paperwork.
UNK: MRS. SULLIVAN : When do you think I can take Shawny home?
BURKE : Um...
UNK: CHRISTINA who is poking around Meredith's stomach : - So who's the father? - I'm not pregnant.
CHRISTINA : Didn't think I was pregnant when I was pregnant.
CHRISTINA : Abdominal pain, fever, the non-stop vomiting.
MEREDITH : - I'm not pregnant. - Don't know who the father is, do you?
MEREDITH : It would have to be Derek's. There's no way it could be Finn's.
UNK: You haven't had sex with the vet yet?
CHRISTINA : Get out of that relationship. Immediately.
MEREDITH : - I can't be pregnant. Can I? - With McBaby?
UNK: Oh, OK.
UNK: - Was I mean when you were pregnant? - I thought you said you weren't.
BAILEY : She's not. We'll have to run more tests.
MEREDITH : In that case, can I have some morphine?
UNK: Check the fetal monitor every 30 minutes.
ALEX : What's the point? The baby's nowhere near where it needs to be.
UNK: You're gonna have to cut her open, so why not get it over with?
UNK: It's not what the patient wants.
ADDISON : It's our job as doctors to balance the desires of the patient
