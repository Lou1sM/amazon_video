UNK: You just gonna stand there, Karev, or are we doing this?
UNK: Mr. Duquette, Denny and I... He was my patient for months.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : And the minute he died,
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : - you quit your job. - I couldn't...
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : Four years of medical school. That's a lot of debt.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : How were you planning on paying that back? Huh?
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : Did you think that Denny would pay for everything?
UNK: Why are you...?
IZZIE : - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about protecting my son.
IZZIE : But where were you when he needed you?
UNK: Because I was there the whole time. I was there.
UNK: I was working 80-hour weeks and I was still always there!
IZZIE : He had so many surgeries.
IZZIE : So many procedures. He was so scared.
IZZIE : Where were you then? Where were you?
IZZIE : You may not get me.
IZZIE : But you don't have to, because I don't get you either.
IZZIE : I don't get how a father abandons his dying son.
UNK: Wait. Wait.
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : Is that what he told you? That I... That his mother and I abandoned him?
CHRISTINA : Well...
UNK: MR. DUQUETTE : ...he didn't tell you the truth.
ALEX : What?
ALEX : What?
UNK: Burke. I thought you told me...
BURKE : I can't hold it still long enough to attach the graft. Look, I can't!
UNK: - You told me your hand was fine! - It's not fine!
UNK: You wanted to believe I was fine. You wanted me to be fine.
UNK: You wanted... I wanted... Damn it!
BURKE : My hands are the only things that I have that are of any value to me...
BURKE : - To you! - Not to me...
UNK: Oh, yes! Yes, to you! You want Preston Burke!
BURKE : My hands...
BURKE : These are who I am.
BURKE : If I can't do this, if I can't finish this surgery, then...
UNK: What if I hold the vessel?
UNK: What if I hold the vessel? Come on.
CHRISTINA : Burke.
CHRISTINA : If I hold the vessel...
BURKE : - I can attach the graft. - OK, so...
CHRISTINA : I put my hand...
UNK: Nobody has to know.
UNK: Derek!
UNK: Look, I know you're mad at me, but Mark Sloan is the best in his field.
UNK: Any unit in this country would be lucky to have him.
DEREK : - You did what you thought was best. - I did.
UNK: Uh, are you all right?
DEREK : Can I ask you a... personal question?
DEREK : Why did you leave Meredith's mother?
CHIEF : I could have left Adele.
UNK: I could've gone away with Ellis.
CHIEF : But I would have had so much baggage,
CHIEF : so much guilt.
UNK: Ellis couldn't see it, but I wasn't...
CHIEF : I never would have made her happy.
CHIEF : Not like she deserved to be happy.
UNK: I was a better man for walking away.
CHIEF : I loved her enough to walk away.
UNK: Oh, oh! On the table, keep me draped.
MEREDITH : Too many people have seen me naked already.
MEREDITH : I'd like to keep what dignity I have left.
UNK: - McSteamy. McSteamy! Whoo-hoo! - Meredith.
UNK: That what you're calling me? McSteamy?
UNK: Yeah. I don't think you're supposed to know.
MARK : How's my favorite dirty mistress?
