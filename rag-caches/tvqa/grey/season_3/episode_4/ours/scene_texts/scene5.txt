UNK: I'm not gonna be one of those weak-ass women
UNK: who'd give all that up the minute things start to get scary. I...
UNK: Rebecca, your birth plan is just that. It's a plan.
UNK: - Jeff, get her out. - She's just trying to be cautious.
UNK: Just get out! Get out!
UNK: Ah! Get out!
BAILEY : Since when do you get out?
UNK: Clearly, I am not myself today.
BAILEY : Never would have figured Mark Sloan to be your type.
UNK: He's not. He's not.
ADDISON : What is he doing here?
ADDISON : He's not supposed to be here. I can't have him here. I can't...
ADDISON : He's supposed to be in New York. I can't function with him here.
UNK: I'm a professional here. People respect me here.
ADDISON : But when he's here, I'm just...
UNK: The woman who gets the hots for man candy and cheats on her husband.
ADDISON : That is rude. And unkind.
ADDISON : And completely true. Oh, my God, what am I gonna do?
BAILEY : For starters, you can keep your knees closed in his presence.
UNK: MR. SULLIVAN : - Miranda. - You asked.
BAILEY : Also, you can remember that no man,
BAILEY : not Derek, not Mark, defines who you are.
DEREK : Well, let's see, your complexion is flushed.
UNK: Abdominal wall's tender.
DEREK : Aren't you happy to have a boyfriend who works in a hospital?
MEREDITH : You are just one of many men I happen to be dating at the moment.
DEREK : Really? How many of us are there?
UNK: - Well, there's, uh, you. - Mm-hmm.
MEREDITH : And Finn. And...
DEREK : Forgive me for pointing out the obvious, but I don't see
UNK: practitioners of veterinarian medicine at your bedside.
FINN : You would if you turned around.
UNK: - Ah, Finn. - Derek.
MEREDITH : Oh, can I just say how much it helps that I'm on drugs right now?
MEREDITH : - So... - So...
DEREK : - So how's life in the animal kingdom? - How about you, Derek? Slow day?
MEREDITH : - Just... - If you need to take off, that's...
UNK: - No, it's fine. I can stay. - Great.
DEREK : - Great. - Great.
UNK: OK, let's get you prepped and ready.
UNK: - Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Finn. - Now all my boys are here.
UNK: You're all so handsome. And such good kissers.
GEORGE : - Oh, God. - Excuse me?
GEORGE : - She's on drugs. - He's an excellent kisser.
FINN : - You two dated? - You didn't know?
MEREDITH : It wasn't a date so much as a disastrously uncomfortable
MEREDITH : sexual experience.
UNK: Oh, I... I can't be here right now.
UNK: None of you can. She's being prepped for surgery. You all need to leave.
GEORGE : - Gladly. - Now! Not you, O'Malley.
MEREDITH : Dr. Bailey. All my boyfriends are here.
BAILEY : Not for long. Say goodbye, Dr. Grey.
DEREK : - I'll be here when you wake up. - So will I.
BAILEY : Now!
CHRISTINA : What are you doing?
BURKE : What does it look like I'm doing?
CHRISTINA : You're not in med school. You don't need to practice on a corpse.
UNK: - Better than on a patient. - Burke. Your hand is fine.
