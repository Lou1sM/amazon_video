Cristina : I just don't know if it's me.
Jane : Five generations of Burke women have worn this on their wedding day.
UNK: It's a way of joining our family.
Jane : - Becoming a Burke. - A Burke.
Jane : I'm afraid I misjudged you early on. I thought you were selfish.
UNK: You've given way to his ideas about the wedding. You've been flexible about
Jane : the things that are... most important to him.
Jane : And that is wonderful. Oh, it's just...
Jane : What were you planning to do about your eyebrows?
Derek : - Nothing. - Uh-huh.
UNK: - How she doing? - BP's 92 over 56.
UNK: How's Jane Doe and her husband?
Alex : Whatever. He cried like a baby, she looked bored.
Addison : Don't go overboard with compassion.
UNK: She's not sure she wants to stay with him. It's complicated.
UNK: It's not, actually. Complicated. They're married, she took a vow.
Izzie : You don't mess with vows. Married is married. Game over. So freaking over.
Izzie : Just an opinion.
Burke : Pressure's dropped to 60. She's bradying down! How much longer?
Addison : I just need two minutes to get these babies out.
UNK: Make it one. She's flatlined. Start compressions.
UNK: - I got the first one out. Clamp. - Come on, come on.
UNK: - Second baby's out. OK, go. - Bulky, ten-blade.
UNK: Poor guy, he just wanted to climb, and he ends up with an ax in his head.
UNK: He shouldn't have tried turning back.
UNK: If the group goes up, you move with the group. OK, drill, please.
UNK: He panicked. Have a right to turn back if you're scared.
UNK: No. He chose to climb a mountain.
Derek : You can't change your mind in the middle of a climb.
RVO : - OK. - Now we pull it out?
UNK: Yeah, but the ax went in as they fell. So there'll be some tearing.
Derek : Should be a shallow wound. It should come out easily.
UNK: - You got it? - Yep.
Derek : All right, everybody. Here we go. Ready?
UNK: OK, one, two, three.
Derek : That's strange.
UNK: One, two, three.
UNK: - That's a clean cut. - You said there was gonna be tearing.
