Cristina : Thought I was gonna hate this party game thing, but it's great.
Cristina : - Can we set her on fire after? - No, we cannot.
UNK: - These wedding vows aren't gonna fit. - Write smaller.
UNK: Hold still, please. "Thou" just became "Cow. "'
Izzie : You don't need vows on your hand. Just speak from the heart.
Cristina : Izzie, the heart is an organ.
UNK: It pumps, circulates blood, gets clogged from time to time.
UNK: It does not speak. It doesn't have tiny little lips on it.
UNK: You're all "glass totally empty. "'
UNK: I'm going to like being married. It's the wedding part that's ridiculous.
UNK: - The party's over. - Damn.
Cristina : Hey, mine didn't go off. Piece of crap.
Meredith : You can do this, right?
Cristina : Become a piece of chattel? Sure. Looking forward to it.
Meredith : No matter what, you're walking down that aisle. I need you to go down that aisle.
UNK: - Toilet paper cutting off circulation? - You marrying Burke?
UNK: It's a sign. A sign that people like you and me can do this.
Meredith : Be healthy. Be happy. You marrying Burke restores my faith in me.
Cristina : - Oh, I get it. My wedding's about you. - Yes.
RVO : - OK. - You can do this, right?
Cristina : - I can do this. - OK
Bailey : They found the fourth climber. Vitals are stabilizing after fluids, but...
Mark : - I thought he was dead - Friends said he was. CT show a bleed?
Bailey : - We haven't done a CT yet. - You said it was head trauma.
Bailey : Yeah, there's been a little head trauma. Ice ax to the head.
Mark : What the hell happened up on that mountain?
Derek : That's a good question.
Richard : You don't think it could be uterine cancer, do you? It runs in the family.
UNK: No. It's not. She was in earlier. She was in a fender-bender.
Richard : My wife came into my hospital and you neglected to tell me?
UNK: Doctor/patient confidentiality.
Richard : We're still married. She's unconscious. There are medical decisions to be made.
UNK: Legally, I have the right to know. I have a right...
UNK: She might be having a miscarriage.
Addison : She's pregnant.
Burke : I need to know what time your chest pains started.
Rina : I don't know. Yesterday afternoon.
Burke : What time exactly? This is important.
UNK: Around three o'clock. What's wrong with me?
UNK: I'm going to explain everything to you.
Burke : But, right now, we need to get you up to the surgical floor.
UNK: Surgery? What about my babies?
Burke : I think those babies are coming out today.
UNK: But I haven't decided.
UNK: I haven't chosen parents. I need time to decide.
Joe : You don't need to decide anything right now.
Joe : Right now the most important thing is making sure that you're OK. All right?
Meredith : Burke.
UNK: I've got a surgery. It shouldn't take me more than four hours, five tops.
UNK: - I could scrub in. - How's Rina?
Burke : Need to get a CT angio, but I'm pretty sure it's a tear in her aorta.
Burke : Heart is about to blow.
Addison : Most dissecting aortas burst within 48 hours.
Burke : We have less than 12 hours to fix it before she's dead.
Addison : - Need me to get the babies out. - So I can save her.
Cristina : You have an aortic dissection?
