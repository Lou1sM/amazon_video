UNK: I know. That doesn't make sense.
George : You are a lucky guy.
Derek : Yeah. Or the ax didn't go in there by accident.
Richard : It's probably unfair, but I hold you to a higher standard.
Richard : And you let me down this year, Preston. After you got shot, the tremor.
UNK: This job is about making the tough calls.
UNK: Sometimes the toughest call you can make
UNK: is admitting when you're in over your head.
UNK: You don't do that.
UNK: You know a lot, Preston.
UNK: You're one of the best surgeons I know.
UNK: One of the best men.
UNK: But you're not perfect.
UNK: You don't know everything.
UNK: I want to give you the job.
Cristina : I want to.
UNK: But I can't.
Bailey : - Preston. - I have a wedding to get to.
Adele : Thank you. The babies are doing great.
Addison : They're in the NICU. How you doing up there, Preston?
Burke : - Close call, but she's stabilized. - Good work, Dr. Burke.
Addison : We may actually get you to the church on time.
Addison : You nervous?
UNK: No. Not really. More... excited.
Burke : Except about my vows. I wrote them myself.
UNK: And I don't know. They may be too... I want them to be right.
UNK: - Well, let's hear them. - What? Now?
Addison : Got a room full of women. Try 'em out on us.
UNK: "Cristina, I could promise...
UNK: ...to hold you and to cherish you.
Burke : I could promise to be there in sickness and in health.
UNK: I could say, "Till death do us part. "'
Burke : But I won't.
UNK: Those vows are for optimistic couples,
Burke : the ones full of hope.
Burke : And I do not stand here on my wedding day
Burke : - optimistic or full of hope. - OK, um...
Burke : I am not optimistic. I am not hopeful.
Burke : I am sure. I am steady.
Burke : And I know I am a heart man.
UNK: I take them apart, I put them back together.
Burke : I hold them in my hands.
Burke : I am a heart man.
UNK: So, of this, I am sure :
UNK: You are my partner, my lover,
Burke : my very best friend.
UNK: My heart, my heart, beats for you.
Burke : And on this day, the day of our wedding,
UNK: I promise you this :
Burke : I promise you to lay my heart in the palm of your hands.
Burke : I promise you... me.
UNK: - Too trite? Because I can rewrite it. - No. No, it's...
Addison : I think I speak for...
Addison : ...every woman in this room when I say dump her.
Addison : Dump Yang and marry me.
George : Hey. Hey.
UNK: Hey. Oh, God! Did I miss a page?
George : No, no, no, no, no. Everything's OK.
UNK: - What? What's up? - Is this really what you want?
UNK: Because if it's really what you want, we could do it.
Callie : - Really? - Yeah.
UNK: - OK, wait, really? - Really.
Callie : - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Really? - Really.
