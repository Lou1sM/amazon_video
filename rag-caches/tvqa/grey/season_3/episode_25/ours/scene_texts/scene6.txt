UNK: She looks like Rebecca. Or, at least, what Rebecca used to look like.
Jeff : - But still... around the eyes. - Yeah.
Jeff : I thought I'd give her some space. She seemed a little overwhelmed.
Alex : The ferry crash was on the news everywhere. Your wife goes missing.
Alex : How could you not look for her?
Jeff : I thought she left me.
Jeff : We got into a fight that night.
Jeff : She was trying to tell me how unhappy she was and I shut her down.
Jeff : Yeah, I didn't look for her when she was missing, but what's worse is,
Jeff : I didn't see her when she was there.
Jeff : I can't imagine what it must have been like for her.
UNK: Her face must have looked all broken.
Alex : She was beautiful.
Jeff : I love her. You know?
Cristina : Meredith.
UNK: Oh, you are not going to believe... Derek met a girl.
Meredith : In a bar. And he flirted with her.
UNK: He told me. You know, no big deal.
UNK: - Thought I should know. - Meredith.
Meredith : I'm not exaggerating. He didn't even hint. He just flat-out told me.
Cristina : You know how sometimes it's about you and sometimes it's about me?
Cristina : - This is really, really about me. - Whoa.
Cristina : Mama took my eyebrows. She took my eyebrows, and now I am a Burke.
UNK: Lonnie's stable. But the damage he sustained is significant.
UNK: - But is he going to wake up? - Do you want him to?
Callie : What?
UNK: The ax in his head was put there deliberately.
UNK: I want to give you three guys another opportunity to tell me the truth.
UNK: - It wasn't what... - Shut up, Andy.
Andy : - But we can't just... - I said shut up, Andy!
Derek : Is that how you let him talk to you at 14,000 feet?
Derek : I have to talk to his family. You guys can talk to the cops.
UNK: - Dr. Bailey? - Yeah? What?
Meredith : Cristina needs to cut something.
Meredith : I can't really explain it in a way that won't make you glare.
Meredith : But they took her eyebrows and they called her a Burke.
Meredith : She really needs to cut somebody open.
UNK: Yang, go.
UNK: Do "getting married" things. Get out of this hospital.
Cristina : Hey!
Cristina : I mean, hey... I...
Cristina : You have to let me cut
UNK: because I'm standing here eyebrow-less with no dignity left.
UNK: I'm a surgeon, Dr. Bailey. But right now, I don't feel like one.
Cristina : I feel... like...
Cristina : ...somebody else.
UNK: Do you know what that's like? Not to feel like yourself?
Bailey : Yeah.
Addison : What's going on?
Richard : Started cramping and then she got diaphoretic.
Addison : Alert OB to a possible D&C due to an incomplete miscarriage.
Addison : Adele, you could have a placental abruption due to the trauma.
UNK: We've got to get you to an OR now. Let's move, people!
Patricia : Sir, Dr. Shepherd is here.
Adele : Thank you.
UNK: Richard, are you sure you want to...? You don't have to do this today.
Richard : Yes, I do.
Addison : She went into early DIC. I gave her blood, platelets, FFP.
Addison : Pregnancy at 52 is dangerous. I tried everything. I couldn't save...
