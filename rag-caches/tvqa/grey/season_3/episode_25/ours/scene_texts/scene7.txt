Adele : He doesn't even know about it. I didn't tell him.
UNK: I... I think I misjudged him.
Adele : I thought he'd go running for the hills.
Adele : But, actually,
UNK: he's a much better man than I thought.
Adele : He'll get over his initial judgments and he'll sit with you,
Adele : and he'll make you drink your water.

UNK: ...I also have to say...
UNK: ...that I'm in love with you.
UNK: I'm in love with you.

Andy : He was in so much pain.
UNK: - So I... picked it up and I put... - Andy shut up!
UNK: No! I'm not going to shut up.
