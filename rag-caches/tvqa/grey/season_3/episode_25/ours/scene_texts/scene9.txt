Meredith : If you want to break up with me so you can see other women, just do it.
Meredith : Don't tell me you met another woman. Just end it, if that's what you want.
Jeff : I can't.
Meredith : Sure you can. Here's how it goes.
UNK: "I don't want to see you anymore. Meredith, I don't love you anymore. "'
Cristina : Meredith...
Derek : ...I do love you.
Derek : Don't you see? Don't you understand?
Derek : You're the love of my life. I can't leave you.
Derek : But you're constantly leaving me.
Derek : You walk away when you want, you come back when you want.
Derek : Not everyone. Not your friends. But you leave me.
UNK: So I'm asking you, if you don't see a future for us, if you're not in this...
UNK: Please... please just end it because I can't. I'm in it.
Derek : Put me out of my misery.
UNK: I can't. Cris... Cristina's getting married.
Meredith : I have to go make sure she gets married.
Cristina : Meredith.
Meredith : I really need to make sure she gets down that aisle.
Derek : Let's go. We're running late.
UNK: - You OK? - I'm fine. Fine.
Derek : You need anything? Need a mint? Getaway car?
Burke : If it's the chief thing, don't worry. You deserve it.
Derek : Richard didn't pick me to be Chief.
Burke : We all assumed... Well, who did he pick?
Derek : I don't know. It wasn't me.
UNK: Oh, you really don't... look so good.
Derek : Meredith and I, we may not make it.
Derek : I think I want it more than she does.
Derek : But today's your day. It's all about you today.
Burke : - You really are a good best man. - I'm trying.
Cristina : Cristina.
Meredith : - Cristina? - I didn't run.
Helen : You look beautiful.
Helen : - I'm proud of you. - Thank you.
Helen : Frankly, I always feared you were
Helen : too emotionally stunted to settle down.
Meredith : You can do this.
UNK: I always found it confusing.
Addison : If you know both the bride and the groom, whose side do you sit on?
UNK: I look for the hottest chick and sit next to her.
RVO : - Stop. - Wanna ditch the reception?
Alex : - Grab a drink instead? - Stop it. You don't want me.
Alex : - Maybe I do. - No, you don't.
Addison : You want Ava.
Alex : She's not Ava anymore. She's Rebecca now. I barely know her.
Addison : Look at me. Look at me.
Addison : You suck.
Addison : To me, you suck. I kind of hate you.
UNK: But, Alex?
UNK: We do not get unlimited chances
Addison : to have the things we want. And this I know.
Addison : Nothing is worse
Addison : than missing an opportunity that could have changed your life.
UNK: And no matter what her name is, she'll always be Ava to you.
UNK: Dr. Bailey?
Bailey : - You didn't go to the wedding either. - No.
UNK: I am so sorry, George.
RVO : So...
George : What do I do now?
Bailey : You fail your intern test, you have two options.
UNK: You can walk away from being a surgical resident altogether.
Bailey : Or you can start from the very beginning.
George : Repeat my internship?
RVO : No.
Jeff : I can't.
Jeff : I can't.
UNK: - Did I... Did I fail you, George? - No.
