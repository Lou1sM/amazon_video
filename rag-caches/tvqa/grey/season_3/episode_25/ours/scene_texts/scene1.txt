UNK: Yeah. I promise I will make it to the chapel in time.
UNK: Richard Voice Over RVO : I...
UNK: OK. Listen up. O'Malley, you're with Shepherd and Sloan.
Bailey : Stevens, you're with Burke, Karev, Addison. Go.
UNK: - Grey, you are with the chief's wife. - The chief's wife?
Bailey : Is pregnant. Yes, I did say pregnant. I recommend you lose the shocked look
Bailey : and try for something a little more dignified. Go.
Cristina : Who am I on?
Bailey : I didn't page you. Go home, get some sleep.
UNK: But I'm here, so...
Bailey : You're getting married in less than 12 hours.
UNK: Give us room!
Cristina : Burke's getting married and he gets to operate.
Bailey : - There's only one Preston Burke. - There's only one Cristina Yang.
Bailey : I've given you the day off. The whole day. It's a kindness. Take it.
Bailey : It's your wedding day. Always be more surgeries.
UNK: What would you rather be doing? Prepping a patient or for your wedding? Go home.
Richard : I never got the sense you wanted the job.
Richard : Seems to me you got in the race to play out some kind of unfinished business
UNK: you have with Derek.
Mark : I was in this to win, sir. I don't know if he's your new Chief,
Mark : but if he is, he got there because I made him fight for it.
Richard : You made them all fight for it.
UNK: - So I'm not going to be Chief? - No, you're not.
Dale : They recovered Lonnie's body?
Derek : Not his body. He's alive.
Derek : Why don't you tell me what really happened up there on the mountain.
UNK: We're halfway up this ice wall. There's a...
Jack : There's a ledge a couple hundred feet above us.
Jack : We figured we'd set up the tents. Wait out the storm.
Jack : Only Lonnie's insisting we go down the mountain.
UNK: I told him we got to dig in. Sit tight.
Dale : He started freaking out. Keeps saying down's the way to go.
Dale : Then he starts climbing down. We were tied together, and just like that...
UNK: We're falling. I swing out with my ax... just trying to catch a rock.
Andy : I clip Lonnie in the back of the head. The ax just... snags.
Andy : We thought he was dead.
Jack : It was an accident.
Addison : - What happened? - You've been unconscious for a while.
UNK: What about...?
UNK: He knows. You lost a lot of blood. I'm going to try to find a heartbeat.
Addison : You should prepare yourself.
Addison : - Heartbeat. - Oh, good.
Addison : It's a little slower than I'd like,
Addison : but once we tank you with liquids and a transfusion, it might get stronger.
UNK: Got to rush off to surgery. I'll be back with you the minute I'm done.
Adele : - Thank you. - OK.
Richard : Adele, why didn't you tell me?
UNK: Oh, come on, Richard.
