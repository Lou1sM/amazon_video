Bailey : - No. I wasn't looking for Chief... - Yeah, you were.
UNK: Yeah. OK, I was.
Callie : - George. - Hey.
UNK: What I'm about to say is crazy and... I... I... I am not responsible.
Callie : I am saying this against my will because I am a surgeon, OK? I love my job,
Callie : I love my life exactly as it is. OK, exactly as it is!
Derek : - Understand? - Not really.
Callie : I have no desire to house a human being in my body for nine long months
UNK: and then... and then push it out and raise it,
UNK: - OK? None. Zero. - OK.
Callie : Except housing a human for nine long months is all that I can think about.
Callie : The thoughts are invading the surgeries that I love and it's... It's hormonal.
UNK: It's... And horrible.
UNK: But it is happening. To me.
George : - You want to have a baby? - Apparently.
George : There's a guy with an ax in his head...
UNK: Right. Go. It's... I'm a freak. Just go. Just run. Just...
Adele : - Thank you. - Please.
Adele : Go. I'm fine.
UNK: Take your pill and drink your water.
UNK: You know you want to go out that door and start bossing people around.
Richard : Take your pill, Adele.
UNK: See, I can do my bossing right from this chair.
Adele : Go ahead, Richard. Ask. I know you are dying to know whose baby...
Richard : Not really my place.
UNK: Mrs. Webber, your room is ready.
UNK: Excuse me, what do you want to do about the announcement for Chief of Surgery?
Richard : I will be right back. I promise.
Adele : We've met before. You probably don't remember. You were little.
Adele : My husband always flirted with your mother.
Adele : I didn't want to see that, so I watched you a lot.
UNK: Watched you grow. You turned out well. I'm sorry about your mother.
UNK: I'm... sorry about my mother too.
Adele : It wasn't your fault. Maybe it wasn't anyone's fault.
UNK: We get married at 25 thinking, "this is it. "'
UNK: "Happily ever after. "' Maybe there is no happily ever after.
Jane : It's stunning.
Addison : It's a little... Is this supposed to be so tight?
Jane : Well, it's a choker.
Cristina : It's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful.
