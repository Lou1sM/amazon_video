Violet : Be a man, Cooper. Be a man.
Pete : There you are.
Pete : Stopped by to see how Lisa and the baby are doing.
UNK: - You OK? - Yeah, I just, I...
Addison : I had a little too much surgery today, but I'm good.
Pete : You look good. You look... beautiful.
UNK: Sam told me to stay away from you because you're Naomi's friend.
Addison : - Stop it. - What?
Addison : - You're flirting. - What's wrong?
Addison : What's wrong with it? What's wrong?
Addison : What's wrong is that I don't have time for it.
Addison : I am out of time. I missed my chance.
Addison : And now I have two eggs left.
Addison : I might as well have no eggs left. I am eggless.
Addison : Naomi says that she's dried up, I'm the one who's dried up.
UNK: I'm all barren and dried up and I've clearly been wasting my time on men.
Addison : I mean, I might as well take up hobbies. Like needlepoint.
UNK: Or collecting those little ceramic dolls, you know?
Addison : Because that's what dried up women do. They do needlepoint.
Addison : They do not waste their time flirting with men
Addison : who clearly just want to get laid. They do not waste their time...
UNK: ...telling overly personal information
Addison : about their eggs to total strangers.
Addison : Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
Addison : What are you doing?
UNK: I'm going to kiss you. I'm going to kiss you with tongue.
UNK: I'm going to kiss you so you feel it.
UNK: OK?
Addison : OK.
UNK: Why did you do that?
UNK: To remind you that you're not dried up.
Pete : If you need me to remind you again...
Pete : ...let me know.
Addison : OK.
Meredith : - When did the cramping start? - A while ago.
Thatcher : - What is it? - Probably nothing serious.
UNK: Could be a reaction to the antibiotic. May have to switch to another.
Meredith : - But it may mean another night here. - It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.
Naomi : Wait.
UNK: Jane Doe : I know. I know that you think we're awful.
Carol : And I think that we're awful. I just...
Carol : I just wanted a baby so badly. I just wanted a baby.
Carol : And I don't care who the father is. I don't care if the baby is mine.
Carol : All that matters is the baby. Is she going to be OK?
UNK: Just tell me that she's going to be OK.
