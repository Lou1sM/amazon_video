UNK: She's going to be OK.
Carol : - Thank you. - You're welcome.
UNK: - I hear Callie's a bridesmaid. - Yeah.
UNK: Would you say that you were the one that needed more urging to get married?
UNK: Oh, I hadn't really been thinking about it.
UNK: I... It just seemed like a good idea at the time.
George : You and Cristina have been together for a while.
Burke : You got married pretty fast.
George : In theory, it's better to know someone. Way better than...
Burke : Still, no guarantees.
UNK: - I don't believe in divorce. - Neither do I.
UNK: Is it possible, do you think,
George : to love two people...
George : ...at the same time?
Burke : I, uh...
Burke : I'm still hoping it's possible just to love one person.
UNK: Hey. So it's not going to be too weird, right?
Callie : - Me as a bridesmaid? - No. No, it's fine.
Callie : - I can tell Cristina... - It's fine. Really. No worries.
UNK: So did George tell you he's thinking about transferring to Mercy West?
Izzie : Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.
Callie : - So we're fine? - Oh, we are. Fine.
Cristina : That last dress was OK, wasn't it?
Cristina : I mean, it was too tight and I couldn't breathe, but...
Cristina : A wedding's just one day, right?
Sam : - Yeah. - Yeah.
Sam : Yeah.
UNK: We got Paul's MRl back.
Sam : And I've consulted with Dr. Strayley at Sloan-Kettering.
Sam : We found a tumor on your adrenal gland, all right?
UNK: It sits on top of the kidney. It's what's been causing your low sex drive.
Kathy : So it wasn't me? He's got a condition?
UNK: Uh, a tumor. That's not too...
Kathy : You can treat that, right?
Sam : These tumors are usually aggressive and found late
Sam : because the symptoms are so subtle.
UNK: What does that mean?
Sam : Treatment is difficult and risky, but there is hope.
Kathy : Oh, my God, honey. I can't believe I yelled at you.
Kathy : - I'm so sorry. - It's all right, honey.
Susan : - It's OK. - No, I'm horrible. I'm so sorry.
Kathy : I love you so much.
Addison : Hello?
Addison : Hello?
UNK: Are you there, elevator God?
Addison : It's me, Addison.
Derek : - What? - Hi.
Naomi : Hi.
UNK: OK, look, you may be a figment of my imagination,
Addison : or maybe I'm going completely insane.
Addison : I don't know.
UNK: Or maybe this is payback
Addison : for my crimes on some ginormous karmic level. I don't know.
Addison : I just...
Addison : I just want to tell you I'm sorry.
Addison : For yelling at you.
UNK: OK?
Addison : OK.
UNK: Well, bye.
UNK: I'm such a screw up. My life...
Kathy : Up until now, I've been really great at one thing.
UNK: I am great at being Paul's wife.
Kathy : And I thought he didn't want me anymore.
UNK: I thought... I was sure that he was in love with somebody else.
Violet : Of course you were.
Kathy : I lied to Paul.
Kathy : I was with a man. That night I didn't come home.
Kathy : I didn't even find him that attractive.
UNK: I just told myself I wasn't going to settle for being alone.
Violet : Kathy, you were reacting to what was in front of you.
Violet : There was no way you could know what was really going on.
Kathy : What do I do now?
Violet : You do what you're great at.
Violet : You love your husband.
UNK: You're going to have to tell me that a lot, OK?
Addison : OK.
Dell : Hey, everyone else is gone. I was heading out.
UNK: Unless... I was going to get some food. You want something?
UNK: Oh. No. I ate. Thanks for asking.
Dell : Another night?
Naomi : - Dell, are you... - Asking you out on a date? Yes.
Naomi : - You can't ask me out. - Yes, I can.
Addison : - You can't. - I asked.
Naomi : You're a fetus. You could be my fetus.
UNK: Coo coo ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson.
UNK: You can't use The Graduate as a defense.
Naomi : You can't use a movie made before you were born as a defense.
Dell : Go out with me.
Dell : I like you. And you like me.
Naomi : - Dell. - Yeah?
UNK: Never going to happen.
Addison : I'm starting to think LA is like New York, but with a beach.
UNK: Why do you think we moved?
UNK: Pete, isn't it time for you to get some refills?
Naomi : Thanks.
