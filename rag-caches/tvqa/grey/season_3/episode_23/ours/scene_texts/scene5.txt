UNK: You've been married a long time, right?
Bailey : O'Malley, I do not have time to answer...
UNK: Did you have doubts? About your marriage?
UNK: I don't mean insecurities, I mean really serious doubts.
Nurse : I need you to sign this before I can discharge bed ten.
Bailey : No. He's supposed to get an IV dose before discharge.
Bailey : Why don't people listen?
UNK: One day you'll have to explain how antibiotics actually work.
Susan : - They are miraculous. - Good afternoon.
Richard : Dr. Bailey asked me to look in. Everything looks good.

Burke : I didn't think anyone would come looking for me down here. I apologize.
Bailey : No problem. Take your time.
UNK: - Dr. Bailey? - Yeah?
Burke : You've been married a long time now, right?
Burke : Do you think it matters if one person is more ready?
Bailey : O'Malley!
Burke : - Yeah? - Come here.
UNK: Yes? Hi, Dr. Burke.
Bailey : I want the two of you to talk to each other.
Bailey : Talk to each other and leave my marriage out of it.
Bailey : I also want you to leave my clinic out of it.
Bailey : And by that I mean, get out.
Bailey : I need the space, I need the peace, I need the quiet and I need it now.
UNK: - Sorry. Gone. - Right. Sorry.

Naomi : Did something go wrong with Lisa's surgery?
UNK: No. We handled it.
UNK: Addison, she is pretty excellent. She's pretty excellent.
UNK: OK. Only because you sighed twice, what's the matter, Cooper?
Cooper : I don't go to hookers. I don't go to strip clubs.
Cooper : I meet women on the Internet that want to meet me.
UNK: So I like them a little younger and a little dirtier. Is that wrong?
UNK: - It's wrong? - You need to meet a grown-up.
Naomi : You need to date someone your own age.
Violet : Someone without a porn-y Internet name. And perhaps no criminal past.
Naomi : - A nice girl. - A viable girl.
Naomi : - With whom you can have a relationship. - You're a doctor.
Naomi : Go out in the real world, meet a woman your own age and ask her out.
