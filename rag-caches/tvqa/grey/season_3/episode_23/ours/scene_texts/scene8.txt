UNK: OK, Pete is my friend. Don't get me wrong, but...
UNK: Why are you warning me? Is he a serial killer?
Addison : Is he a felon? Is he secretly my ex-husband's best friend?
Sam : His wife died eight years ago.
Addison : - Now I feel shallow. - No. It's just...
Sam : He can't connect with women.
Sam : He's a good man, but if you want someone who's going to be there,
Sam : then Pete's not that guy.
UNK: - We were good. - Very good.
Cooper : This is nice, huh?
Violet : - It is. - Yeah.
UNK: - No, no. Oh, no! - What?
UNK: - That's not nice. No. No... - You say...
UNK: - You said be a man. - Oh, Cooper. I commend you.
UNK: You were making an effort, but I'm... I'm your friend.
Violet : You can't be a man with your friend.
Violet : - Isn't that settling? - Kind of. Yeah.
George : - Yes. - OK.
Violet : - Settling. - Great.
Cooper : - Thank you. Yes. - But we're good?
Cooper : - We're very good. - OK.
UNK: Hey, ex-best friend! Hey, ex-husband!
Addison : - You are drunk. - Ten more minutes and I dance.
Naomi : And I require company.
Sam : I don't think I've ever seen her drunk before.
Pete : Sam...
Addison : Did you cheat on her?
Sam : Over the years there have been temptations.
UNK: But no, I didn't.
UNK: - Was there a lot of fighting? - Hardly ever.
Sam : Honestly...
Sam : It was bad, what I did.
Sam : I have no good reason.
Sam : I woke up one day... and I couldn't do it anymore.
Sam : It wasn't even a choice.
Sam : I had a thought,
UNK: the next thing you know, I'm burning it all down.
Sam : I left her.
UNK: I don't know why.
UNK: I don't know why.
UNK: - What kind of person does that? - Hell if I know.
Addison : And I did it too.
UNK: So I ran into Allan. At Whole Foods.
UNK: You want to hear something funny?
Violet : He said he didn't believe in marriage. That marriage wasn't for him.
Violet : But I guess that was wrong.
Violet : Because it only took him four months.
UNK: Four months after we broke up he got married.
UNK: To someone who can't be more than 25 years old.
UNK: Isn't that funny?
Cooper : It heads off rejection.
Derek : - What? - That's why I like the Internet.
Cooper : I can't stand...
Cooper : It's horrible being rejected.
Violet : It is.
Jane : Preston, I thought you had a late surgery.
UNK: You know all that "I trust you" crap?
Burke : You've been pulling that on me since I was this high.
Jane : - Preston, language. - No.
Burke : "I trust you" is code for "learn from your mistakes. "'
UNK: - This is not a mistake! - I never said it was a mistake...
Burke : Cristina never knows what's good for her, that's who she is.
Jane : - Preston. - She hates change.
Burke : I lead, I have to, and then she's grateful.
Burke : That's how it was with dating, with moving in.
