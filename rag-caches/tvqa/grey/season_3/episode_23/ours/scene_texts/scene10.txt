UNK: She came here because she trusted you.
Thatcher : I trusted you.
Derek : - Meredith, just stop. - No, don't. Don't!
MVO : At some point,
UNK: maybe we accept the dream has become a nightmare.
Thatcher : She had the hiccups. Oh, God.
Susan : The hiccups.
Burke : They've left. It's just us.
Cristina : Oh, thank God.
Cristina : - I got a dress. - Yeah?
UNK: Mm-hm.
Burke : You happy?
UNK: Yeah. Are you? Happy?
Sam : Yeah.
MVO : We tell ourselves the reality is better.
Alex : Limes!
Alex : - Limes! - Limes!
Alex : So, what are we drinking to this time?
Izzie : Friends. Crappy friends.
Meredith : Family. Crappy family.
Alex : Again?
Addison : - Again. - Again.
Meredith : Who wants another?
MVO : We convince ourselves it's better that we never dream at all.
MVO : But the strongest of us,
MVO : the most determined of us, we hold onto the dream.
Naomi : - You're ugly and old. - I'll miss you too.
Addison : OK.
Naomi : - There is an empty office. - Ha! Don't tempt me.
Naomi : Think about it.
MVO : Or we find ourselves faced with a fresh dream we never considered.
UNK: Hold the door!
MVO : We awake to find ourselves...
MVO : ...against all odds...
MVO : ...feeling hopeful.
UNK: This is going to sound...
Addison : When no one else is around,
UNK: the elevator kind of talks to me.
UNK: - Hi, Tillie. - Hey, Pete.
UNK: That's Tillie. She works security.
Pete : The camera is right there.
UNK: - Hello, Tillie. - Hey, I get my kicks wherever I can.
UNK: - You going home? - Yeah. Home.
Pete : You get what you came for?
UNK: I honestly don't know.
Pete : Do you want me to kiss you again?
UNK: I think... not.
Pete : Because of the elevators where you come from?
Pete : Those horny, aphrodisiac elevators?
UNK: Yeah, that and I'm not interested.
Pete : You're interested.
MVO : And if we're lucky, we realize,
MVO : in the face of everything,
MVO : in the face of life...
MVO : ...the true dream...
MVO : ...is being able to dream at all.
