Burke : Then I'm pleased for you.
Burke : Look, I am going to make her happy, Mama!
Burke : The wedding is a huge step. She's been a great sport. You know why?
UNK: Because she will be happy some day!
Jane : If you are so sure, why are you yelling at me?
Meredith : - What happened? - She's septic.
UNK: Sooner we get her to an OR, sooner we help. Let's move.
Meredith : - What happened? - Extremely rare complication.
UNK: Toxic megacolon with a perforation. Get your dad out of this room.
Thatcher : - This fast? How... - Sometimes it progresses rapidly.
Richard : Rarely, but sometimes. We booked an OR.
UNK: You're going into surgery now? I didn't sign a consent form.
UNK: She needs surgery right now. Not tomorrow, not later today. Right now.
UNK: - Thatcher? - Honey, listen...
UNK: You need to just stay back, OK?
UNK: We're standing by. OR's ready.
UNK: You're going to be OK. This happens. You're going to be OK.
UNK: We're losing her pulse! She's coding!
UNK: - Let's go! - OK, let's go. Let's move! Move!
UNK: Coming through!
UNK: She's OK, huh?
Lisa : I mean, after all she went through she still looks pretty awesome.
Cooper : Lisa, we need to know what you want to do with the baby.
UNK: - Carol, she wants this so bad. - This is about what you want.
Naomi : - We did find out the paternity. - I don't want to know.
Lisa : She's awesome, though.
Addison : You don't have to decide right now.
Lisa : No. I know what I want to do.
UNK: - Oh, hi. - Lisa gave the baby to Carol?
Cooper : On the condition they'd all be part of her life.
UNK: Turns out the baby'll have three dads anyway.
Naomi : - And two moms. - Lisa did a good thing.
Violet : They look happy.
Naomi : They look like a family.
George : - Izzie, look... - Look, I don't want you to go.
UNK: To Mercy West. I don't want you...
Izzie : It's not fair.
Izzie : I know we can't help what happened, and I know that we didn't...
Izzie : I stood in that bridal shop with your wife and I smiled
Izzie : and I talked and I felt like...
Izzie : It's not fair.
Izzie : I don't want you to go to Mercy West
Izzie : because I'm losing my best friend and it's not fair.
UNK: It's just not fair.
Izzie : We can't.
UNK: Jane Doe : I know.
UNK: Hey! I was looking for you. You ready to go?
Alex : A lot of folks would kill for what you have, you know?
Alex : A clean slate.
UNK: So you don't remember. So what?
UNK: You'll make new memories.
UNK: Oh, wow. Look at that.
UNK: So beautiful.
UNK: Jane Doe : How can you be so...
UNK: Jane Doe : You're so good with me.
UNK: Jane Doe : What's wrong with you that you can't be this good
UNK: Jane Doe : with someone you have feelings for?
UNK: Jane Doe : What happened to you, Alex?
Alex : Maybe I don't remember.
Alex : So what?
UNK: We did everything we could.
Thatcher : You said it was really simple
UNK: and that it was a small thing.
Meredith : It was.
UNK: She had the hiccups!
