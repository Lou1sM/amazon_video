UNK: Stop saying "ow. "' It doesn't hurt.
UNK: - OK. I'm done. - Wait, wait. Where are you going?
UNK: - You can't leave me like this. - Lie there. Don't move. Breathe.
Pete : You're going to experience a rush of emotion.
UNK: A release of psychic pain.
Addison : Hello?
Addison : Hello?
UNK: I don't feel anything!
UNK: Except stupid for letting a cute hippie boy put needles in my face.
Addison : Hello!
UNK: Yeah, Pete!
Addison : I...
Addison : This isn't working. I don't have any psychic pain.
Addison : I'm great.
UNK: Barren but fan-freaking-tastic.
UNK: You can come back now!
Addison : I am not feeling any, you know, rush of emotion or anything.
Addison : I don't feel... anything.
Addison : I don't feel anything at all.
Addison : I don't feel anything at all.
Addison : I hate LA.
Bailey : - Hey. - Hey.
Derek : I heard Susan was back.
UNK: - Everything OK? - An infection. She'll be fine.
UNK: Good. I figure if anything was wrong, you'd tell me.
Meredith : If it was serious. In a "letting you in" sort of way.
Meredith : - You know, it's weird. - What?
UNK: My father. We're almost talking.
Derek : Really?
Meredith : - How's the trailer? - It's freezing.
UNK: You want to eat later? I'll bring something over.
Meredith : - Using me for central heating? - Among others.
Addison : - OK. - All right.
Dell : - Lisa...? - I think something is wrong.
Jim : - She's in pain. - Lisa?
Lisa : Something is not right.
UNK: - My God. I think I've wet my pants. - Your water broke. She's in labor.
UNK: - It's fast. - I'll call an ambulance. Get Cooper.
Addison : Let the hospital know we're coming.
Addison : Call the chief. I don't want problems when I scrub in.
Pete : Breathe.
Lisa : - I need to push! - Don't push!
UNK: Get her to labor and delivery. Jim, check her in.
Carol : Lisa!
UNK: - Is she OK? Are they OK? - What happened?
Keith : - Too early. - She's not due for a month.
UNK: I guess the stress of you fighting and crowding her,
Addison : declaring yourselves the father didn't help! Move!
Violet : Any word on Lisa and the baby?
Pete : We're still waiting.
Violet : - Therapy sucks. - Said the shrink.
Violet : No, I mean, my particular brand of therapy?
UNK: It might, actually, be full of crap.
Violet : People talking about their problems endlessly.
Violet : Telling people to think positively, visualize their destiny.
Pete : - It doesn't work? - I think positively.
Violet : I visualize my destiny.
Violet : And look. Just look.
UNK: - What am I looking at? - Me.
Violet : My pathetic, miserable existence.
Violet : He left six months ago. He was a loser!
UNK: Did you know he peed a little bit every time he coughed?
Violet : Like an incontinent old woman. He smelled like pee.
Violet : There I was in the car, crying. And I am a serious feminist.
