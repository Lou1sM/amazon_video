UNK: and I don't want to because I don't know how long she's going to be ours.
SUSAN : We'll call him together. He's just going to be happy to hear your voice.
UNK: And the baby's going to be OK, you hear me?
ALEX : - I thought you were Sloan's right hand. - Sloan can kiss my...
PETE : Ow!
ALEX : - I haven't even put the needle in yet. - Sorry. I'm just not a big fan of pain.
UNK: You're having extensive and painful surgery.
UNK: You think this is an elective procedure?
UNK: That we're in here because we're getting on each other's nerves?
JAKE : You want to know the real reason?
UNK: - Come on. She doesn't want to. - It's because we have rules.
ALEX : Rules?
UNK: Like say one of us is on a dinner date.
UNK: According to the rules, the other one's supposed to sit there quietly,
UNK: eat and shut the hell up.
UNK: I try. It's just the way you talk to her sometimes...
JAKE : - Is none of your business. - How?
UNK: He sticks up for me. I think that that's kind of nice.
UNK: You don't talk to him anymore.
UNK: What? We can't even be friends now?
JAKE : - We have other rules too. - Oh.
UNK: Like for when we're with someone?
ALEX : Got it. Sort of.
JAKE : No looking. No talking. No touching!
PETE : - It was an accident! - This is going to end badly.
UNK: You were dreaming.
ELENA : I told you. I'm completely fine with it.
UNK: How are you OK with the fact that he's touching you while you're naked?
UNK: Because it wasn't a big deal.
ELENA : It was kind of sweet and... It wasn't a big deal.
UNK: Wait, you liked it?
JAKE : You enjoyed it.
UNK: I'm completely in love with you, that's not even...
UNK: You're a great guy and you know, when we make love,
UNK: that's great. It's really great.
ELENA : And I've never had that before and it's just that
UNK: when you fall asleep... that...
UNK: Pete and I just... we talk.
ELENA : And... I really love that too.
JAKE : - Elena. - No. No. No. You have to choose.
CHIEF : - What? - Him or me.
JAKE : We're going to have this surgery and you can't have us both.
JAKE : So choose. Him or me.
JAKE : This is the part where you're supposed to say, "You, Jake. I choose you. "'
ELENA : I'm so sorry, Jake. I'm so sorry.
UNK: - Elena... Ow! - No, no, no!
UNK: Don't do this!
UNK: I swear to God! I'm going to kill you!
IZZIE : I think it's romantic. Two brothers fighting over the same woman.
UNK: Know what's freaky?
UNK: The "conjoined twin having sex in front of the other one" thing.
ALEX : - How do you do that? - Family is complicated.
UNK: You're here. You haven't been kicked out yet.
MEREDITH : - Alex. - No, not yet. I'm still here.
ALEX : How'd you do it?
UNK: Did you have some kind of signal so that the nurses wouldn't know?
UNK: - Or did you...? - Alex.
UNK: I'm wondering how to get ahead here.
UNK: I get coffee for Sloan. Yang gets surgeries none of us would get.
GEORGE : Got a head count on how many patients you two lied to in the past month?
CHRISTINA : George.
IZZIE : Her patients lived, so she gets to scrub in.
MEREDITH : Izzie.
UNK: Meredith, please. Can we just stop defending me?
BAILEY : Ah.
UNK: - No, no, no. No, I'll... I'll go. - Oh, wait, wait.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Georgie, you should make nice with her.
UNK: - Look, Dad... - Mr. O'Malley, it's fine.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : It's not fine.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : - George, you're so angry. - No, I'm not.
