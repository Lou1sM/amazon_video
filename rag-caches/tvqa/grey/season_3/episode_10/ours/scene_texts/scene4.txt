ADDISON : You left me hanging in there, Grey.
UNK: I'm sorry. I was... I'm sorry. Do you need me to scrub in on the baby?
UNK: No. I want you to keep them apprised of the baby's condition while I operate.
MEREDITH : - I'm sure they'd rather talk to you. - Baby's got jejunal atresia.
ADDISON : She may die. I got consent, but I don't have time for updates.
MEREDITH : I think I would really learn a lot from observing.
ADDISON : It was a mistake to let you in the OR with your family.
ADDISON : It's not going to happen again. Check in with me every hour.
UNK: How many valve replacements have you performed in your life, Dr. O'Malley?
BAILEY : None. And how many do you think Dr. Hahn has performed?
UNK: - That is my father. - And you're in that room as his son.
BAILEY : You interns think you can do whatever you want. Not anymore.
BAILEY : Which is why you are going to stay away. Fifty feet away, to be precise.
UNK: You are to remain 50 feet away from your father today.
BAILEY : And Dr. O'Malley, do not make me tell you again.
UNK: - Everything OK with the O'Malleys? - The kid's a pain in the ass.
HAHN : But Dr. Yang here is proving to be an extremely capable asset.
HAHN : I hear she studied under you. You trained her well.
CHIEF : Yes.
BURKE : She's very...
BURKE : ...professional.
UNK: What do you know about Dr. Levine?
CHIEF : Pretty good.
BURKE : Better or worse than Dr. Korsikov?
BAILEY : Wait.
CHIEF : Why are you researching neurosurgeons
UNK: when we both know that Derek's better than anybody?
BURKE : I don't want Shepherd.
UNK: You blaming this on him?
CHIEF : You know, up until now, I have not yelled.
CHIEF : I have not yelled because you were a guy in trouble and I was supporting you,
UNK: - but now? I am yelling! - Chief.
UNK: I'm yelling very loudly! I want to retire, Burke!
CHIEF : I want my wife back and I passed the torch to you!
CHIEF : I passed the torch to you and you blew it out!
UNK: Look, I know I let you down.
CHIEF : Burke... I'm tired.
CHIEF : I'm tired of you men acting like boys.
CHIEF : You let me down.
CHIEF : And if you don't let Derek fix that hand, you're letting yourself down.
UNK: Twenty-two surgeons. It takes 22 surgeons to do this.
UNK: So where are we?
UNK: I've gotten to the cauda equina.
BAILEY : I'll be working on the musculature of the perineal floor.
MARK : I'll be harvesting the sural nerve for transfer.
UNK: And once I resect this artery, we'll have less than two minutes before
UNK: all sensation to these nerves are gone.
UNK: I'm pretty sure we'll have enough nerve to transfer and cover the deficits.
UNK: We can definitely do this.
UNK: Oh, damn it.
DEREK : It's going to be a lot more fragile in the body.
DEREK : It's one thing if this is a life or death situation
UNK: and this is all we can do to save them,
UNK: but these guys are fine.
DEREK : This isn't worth the risk.
UNK: How's our baby?
MEREDITH : She has an intestinal obstruction, which is why she couldn't breathe.
MEREDITH : Dr. Montgomery is operating on her right now.
UNK: I can't do this. I can't do it.
UNK: Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
UNK: I'm right here, baby, and Dad's on the way.
Molly : - I have to call Eric. - OK.
Molly : - I don't know what to tell him. - Her husband. He's in Iraq.
UNK: I can't tell him this. He's going to want to name her,
