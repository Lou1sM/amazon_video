DEREK : It'd be nice if every love triangle could be fixed with a scalpel.
UNK: If they could, you'd have stabbed me with a ten blade a long time ago.
UNK: I'll call you back. How is she?
SUSAN : Tell me good news because I have to go tell Molly
Molly : and I don't want to tell her anything bad.
MEREDITH : Dr. Montgomery is on her way and she will explain everything.
MEREDITH : - But the baby... - Laura. Molly named her Laura.
MEREDITH : Laura... will need some recovery time, but she should be just fine.
UNK: Oh, thank you. Oh, I was so scared.
UNK: Oh, thank you! Oh, God.
UNK: She's going to be so happy to hear this.
SUSAN : Hey, this is your niece, you know?
MEREDITH : I'm sorry. You're very nice.
MEREDITH : You both seem so nice.
MEREDITH : But I don't know you.
MEREDITH : And you are not my family.
UNK: We're closing the aortotomy. What's next?
CHRISTINA : Place the needle in the ascending aorta to remove air,
UNK: then release the aortic valve clamp.
HAHN : You remind me of myself when I was an intern.
CHRISTINA : - I do? - Focused, intense. Cold.
HAHN : And I don't mean that as a bad thing. Cold is good.
HAHN : The dating, the friends, the family. Ifyou ask me? It's all overrated.
UNK: All right. Tubes are out.
CHRISTINA : The ascending aorta is looking dilated.
HAHN : There's too much bleeding around the aortic suture line.
UNK: BP's 68 over 42.
UNK: God.
UNK: He's bradying down.
HAHN : Get me another TEE and an echocardiogram, stat!
HAHN : Let's move it, people. This doesn't look good.
UNK: We got to get control of this bleeding.
UNK: Let's get him back on bypass.
UNK: I could put the cannula into his right atrium.
HAHN : - By yourself? - Yes.
UNK: All right, do it.
UNK: Replace it with a two stage venous cannula.
GEORGE : Why is she doing that? Why is Hahn letting her do...
UNK: It's OK. She's doing a running whip stitch.
BURKE : She's done it before.
BURKE : There you go.
UNK: Yeah, that's beautiful work, Dr. Yang.
BURKE : Dr. Hahn's work was impeccable, O'Malley.
BURKE : I wouldn't have done anything different myself.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : It's just...
UNK: You can never tell how the body is going to respond.
BURKE : Every surgery, every body is different.
UNK: You just... never know.
UNK: But it's OK now. They're in the home stretch.
GEORGE : Thank you, Dr. Burke.
BAILEY : It undermines everything for my interns to see Yang go without punishment.
BAILEY : For me to see Burke go without punishment.
CHIEF : Take a step back. Try and get some perspective.
UNK: So there will be no consequences? For either of them?
UNK: What would you have me do?
UNK: Fire the both of them? End their careers?
UNK: They made a terrible judgment call.
UNK: - That happened with Denny Duquette! - And they didn't kill anybody!
BAILEY : And I did.
CHIEF : You didn't kill Duquette, and I won't have you saying you did.
UNK: But I was responsible for Izzie Stevens. I was responsible.
UNK: And I'm responsible for Cristina Yang.
UNK: I... am the common thread here.
UNK: I lost them.
UNK: Cristina, Izzie.
CHIEF : Are not the same.
