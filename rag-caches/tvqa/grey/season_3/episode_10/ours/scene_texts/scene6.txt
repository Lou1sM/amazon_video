UNK: You've been picking fights and that's not like you.
GEORGE : Dad.
GEORGE : You don't know what's been going on.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : OK, then, tell me. Why are you so mad at Dr. Torres?
CALLIE : - I have patients to see. - You know what? I'm going to go.
UNK: No! Everybody stays.
UNK: You're angry, Georgie.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : At Callie, at your brothers, at Dr. Hahn, at Dr. Bailey,
UNK: at Dr. Yang, at Dr. Burke!
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : That's a long list of people to be angry at.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Especially when the person you're really angry at... is me.
GEORGE : Dad.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : I drink. And I smoke. And I don't exercise.
UNK: And I eat all the wrong things. And now I have cancer.
UNK: And you have to take care of everything. You have to take care of me.
GEORGE : I don't mind.
ADDISON : You do.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : You're mad at me.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : And that's OK, because I'm mad at me too.
UNK: You think I want to die and leave my boy in charge?
GEORGE : You are not going to die.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : What's going on?
RONNIE : You're not supposed to be in here, Georgie.
GEORGE : Georgie doesn't work here in this hospital! My name is Dr. O'Malley!
BAILEY : Dr. O'Malley.
GEORGE : - Dad? - Honey!
GEORGE : Dad?
UNK: Get Dr. Hahn.
PETE : - I can't... - Dad? Dad, don't try to talk.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : - He's having a heart attack. - Why don't you pump his chest?
UNK: - They always use the paddles! - He's not having a heart attack. Dad?
UNK: I'm trying to help you. Your heart's going too fast.
CALLIE : Recycle his BP.
UNK: Pull verapamil. Five milligrams. Dad! Dad! Stop fighting the mask!
BURKE : O'Malley, what's going on?
UNK: - You should've paged Hahn. - I paged anyone from cardiothoracics!
GEORGE : He's got A-fib. I've ordered verapamil.
UNK: He's in V-tach. The verapamil is going to cause more problems.
UNK: - One hundred lidocaine. - Put on his O2 mask.
UNK: All right. What happened?
UNK: He went into V-tach. O'Malley is giving him lidocaine.
BURKE : It's already put him back in normal sinus.
HAHN : I need everyone out of here.
IZZIE : - I got your page. - Need another cappuccino.
IZZIE : Did you think I was kidding before?
MARK : I am your attending.
