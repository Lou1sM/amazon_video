ELLIS : He's with her. He's with that woman, his wife.
UNK: I don't think he is. Not anymore.
UNK: He is. I mean, why would he do that? He loves me.
ELLIS : I mean, why would he go back to her? I gave up everything for him.
UNK: Mom?
MEREDITH : Mom, look at me.
MEREDITH : This happened a very long time ago.
MEREDITH : This is not happening now.
ELLIS : It's because I have a daughter, isn't it?
ELLIS : He always said he didn't want kids. I should never have had a kid.
BAILEY : - What's going to happen to them? - What?
UNK: Dr. Burke and Dr. Yang? What are you going to do to them? Their punishment.
CHIEF : - Dr. Bailey. - There's a need for justice here.
DEREK : Justice?
CHIEF : Justice has no definition within the four walls of a hospital, Dr. Bailey.
CHIEF : - This isn't a court of law. - What's going to be done?
UNK: Legally and technically, they've done nothing wrong.
CHIEF : Nobody died, there was no malpractice. I haven't made a decision.
UNK: - Excuse me? He... - He what?
CHIEF : Nothing.
UNK: Dr. Yang, you go back on the floor with Dr. Bailey.
BAILEY : - Sir! - Am I not understanding this?
CHIEF : Does this situation directly harm you in some way?
BAILEY : No, sir. I am fine.
CHIEF : Then get back to work.
CHIEF : Burke, you and Shepherd need to come together on this as soon as possible.
DEREK : - He doesn't want my help. - Derek.
BURKE : - I don't want his help. - That hand is worth 2 million dollars.
CHIEF : I want it fixed and I want it fixed yesterday. Figure it out.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Listen, your brothers are good boys, but they're not that responsible.
GEORGE : It's a standard procedure.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : - It's just that if things go wrong... - Dad.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : If things go wrong,
UNK: the life insurance papers are in the second drawer in my nightstand.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : And my magazines are in the garage, with the truck manuals.
UNK: Your magazines?
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Get them out of there, so your ma doesn't see them.
UNK: Your magazines?
UNK: Good morning, Mr. O'Malley.
UNK: I wanted to stop by before the surgery and see how that collarbone was healing.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Georgie.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : You're not going to say hello to Dr. Torres?
UNK: I'm going to see you for rounds, Dad.
UNK: Ifyou had told me you were developing a tremor, I could've run some tests.
UNK: The likelihood is compression ofthe structures around the injury.
UNK: - I can go in there... - I don't want another surgery.
UNK: Could be a small clot. I just go in...
BURKE : Shepherd, I don't want another surgery.
BURKE : The first one caused enough damage.
DEREK : I can do this.
UNK: That's what you said the last time. Now I have a tremor.
IZZIE : Maybe she'll be on "look, don't touch" patrol.
UNK: - At least I'd have some company. - Whatever she gets, I hope it's bad.
MEREDITH : - She made a mistake. We all... - Mistake?
GEORGE : She was going to let Burke, Burke with the shaky hand, operate on my father.
