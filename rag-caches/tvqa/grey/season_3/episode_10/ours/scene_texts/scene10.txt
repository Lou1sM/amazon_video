UNK: Miranda, you raised them.
CHIEF : You raised them like... like children.
CHIEF : And some of them make mistakes and some of them disappoint you.
CHIEF : Some of them...
CHIEF : Do you know what kind of strength it must have taken Yang to come to me?
CHIEF : To report on an attending? On her boyfriend?
CHIEF : Do you see how much she's grown?
UNK: You raise them. Like children.
UNK: And some of them turn out exactly like you, Dr. Bailey.
UNK: - We're finally alone. - Yeah.
DEREK : Pete?
PETE : It's been a long day.
UNK: OK. All right.
ELENA : Well, you get a good night's sleep and I'll come back in the morning.
UNK: At the end ofthe day, when it comes down to it,
MEREDITH : all we really want...
MEREDITH : ...is to be close to somebody.
JAKE : Couldn't stay away?
MEREDITH : So this thing, where we all keep our distance
MEREDITH : and pretend not to care about each other?
MEREDITH : It's usually a load of bull.
SUSAN : - Did you want to come in? - No. I just...
UNK: - She's OK? - She's beautiful.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Good.
SUSAN : We could be your family if you wanted.
SUSAN : You have a mother, I know. I'm not saying...
SUSAN : I'm just saying that we could be your family too.
MEREDITH : So we pick and choose who we want to remain close to.
UNK: - I can't take this anymore. - What?
MEREDITH : Let her off the hook. Let Cristina off the freaking hook.
SUSAN : Meredith.
MEREDITH : Izzie, you cut the LVAD wire. She stuck by you and did Denny's echo.
MEREDITH : You cheated on Izzie with syph nurse and she helped you study for your boards.
UNK: And George, when everybody was calling you 007...
GEORGE : She was calling me 007.
MEREDITH : Just let her off the hook.
BURKE : It's OK.
MEREDITH : Sorry.
CHRISTINA : Why can't you mind your own business? You know, what is your problem?
MEREDITH : You're my sister. You're my family. You're all I've got.
MEREDITH : And once we've chosen those people...
CHRISTINA : I'm so tired.
MEREDITH : I know. Me too.
MEREDITH : ...we tend to stick close by...
UNK: I just... I wanted to check on your dad and see how he was doing.
UNK: Good. He's resting, but he's good.
MEREDITH : - OK. - OK.
MEREDITH : ...no matter how much we hurt them.
CHIEF : Hey.
UNK: Hi there.
UNK: I'm going to go upstairs with Dr. Burke.
DEREK : He wants me to take a look at his shoulder.
UNK: Going to be a while. Don't wait up.
MEREDITH : OK.
MEREDITH : The people that are still with you at the end of the day?
MEREDITH : Those are the ones worth keeping.
MEREDITH : And sure, sometimes, close can be too close.
ELLIS : I couldn't stay with him. I don't care that he's Meredith's father!
UNK: I just couldn't take it! And then Richard... and he...
UNK: What am I...?
SUSAN : Meredith.
MEREDITH : Mommy.
MEREDITH : But sometimes, that invasion of personal space...
MEREDITH : ...it can be exactly what you need.
