UNK: And ifyou want in on my surgeries,
UNK: you're going to learn how to fetch and stay and heel.
BAILEY : - Fine. - Don't fetch angry.
UNK: Do you think this means I respect you? Ifyou want me to respect you,
IZZIE : you have to do something worth respecting.
UNK: All these cables of nerves. Oh, God. I can't do the surgery, Miranda. It's...
BAILEY : I started to think I shouldn't be operating after the Duquette M & M.
UNK: All the whispers and the talk.
BAILEY : - I let that in. - Mmm.
BAILEY : Started to question myself.
BAILEY : I believed it when I was told I was no longer of use in the OR.
UNK: When you said you wanted justice, you were talking about...
UNK: Because I'm a surgeon.
UNK: There are lives in my hands and to make me question that?
UNK: That's like to put a life at stake every time I hold a scalpel.
UNK: I told Burke I could fix his hand and...
BAILEY : - Well, you did. - Yeah.
BAILEY : He is not paralyzed or disabled in any way. He has a tremor.
BAILEY : And if he'd been honest about that,
BAILEY : well, there's no telling what you could've done to prevent it.
BAILEY : You can do this.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Hold onto my wedding ring, honey. Hospital rules.
UNK: Georgie, are you going to be there in the operation?
GEORGE : They don't allow family in, but you'll be fine.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : - I'll be fine. - We'll take good care ofyou.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : What am I going to do? What am I going to do if he dies?
JAKE : - I changed my mind. - Oh, no, you didn't.
GEORGE : I'd like to be excused from the twins. I'd like to be with my mom.
BAILEY : That's the right call, O'Malley. Go.
JAKE : Promise me something?
JAKE : When you separate us, can you make sure his ass is bigger than mine?
PETE : I can hear you.
UNK: You're still here? I went to the NICU, I thought you'd be done.
UNK: Having trouble with this anastomosis and still have to look at the distal bowel.
MEREDITH : - What should I tell Molly? - I don't know.
ADDISON : Tell her I'm doing the best I can. I don't know.
MARK : Dr. Bailey, I'd like my intern to observe from a better vantage point.
UNK: Dr. Stevens?
UNK: Yes. She's my intern today and I'd like her nearby during surgery,
MARK : not up in the gallery, if that's OK with you.
BAILEY : No problem.
CHIEF : Dr. Bailey, Stevens is without privileges.
