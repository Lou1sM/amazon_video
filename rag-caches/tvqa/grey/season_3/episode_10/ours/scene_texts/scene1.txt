CHRISTINA : Could you stop looking at me like that?
UNK: It's creepy and it makes me feel like you haven't been fed.
MEREDITH : - How's it going? - How's what going?
MEREDITH : You and Burke. Are you OK?
CHRISTINA : We're existing in total silence.
UNK: - He's not talking to you? - I'm not talking to him either.
MEREDITH : I'm sorry. Are you OK?
UNK: Stop asking me that.
UNK: - I'm making an effort here. - Please don't.
BAILEY : Rounds started 30 seconds ago.
BAILEY : The chief may be confused about punishment for you, but I'm not.
BAILEY : You late again, you will find another resident.
ADDISON : Dr. Bailey, can I have Grey?
BAILEY : - You can have them all. - Something you needed, Dr. Montgomery?
UNK: I thought you might want to be warned.
MEREDITH : I'm sorry.
UNK: Your sister Molly's just been admitted for an emergency C-section.
MEREDITH : Molly's not my sister.
ADDISON : Technically, she is. You have the same father. And Susan...
UNK: Susan Grey is definitely not my mother.
UNK: I appreciate you trying to be nice, but I really don't need to know this.
ADDISON : Actually, you do.
SUSAN : Hello, Meredith.
GEORGE : Hi, Mom.
ELLIS : Hi.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : I put out some breakfast in case you kids haven't eaten.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : - Oh. - Score.
BAILEY : - Karev. - Hey, ready for the big day, Pops?
JERRY : Food.
UNK: Let's make this fast, people. I have a day. Which one of the interns is mine?
ALEX : - He's family and she's a candy striper. - I'm ready.
UNK: What if you did pick me?
GEORGE : - Pick me. - Guys! This is serious.
BAILEY : Yang.
CHIEF : - What? - What?
UNK: Dr. Hahn, Cristina is very good with cardio.
UNK: I'm sure you can use her for the day.
UNK: What are you waiting for, Yang? Present the case.
UNK: Harold O'Malley, 63, diagnosed with esophageal cancer and aortic regurg.
CHRISTINA : Scheduled for aortic valve replacement.
UNK: I wanted that surgery and she hands it to Yang.
ALEX : - I haven't had a cardiac case in ages. - It's my father.
UNK: Guess there's a double standard. Yang does something wrong and gets rewarded.
IZZIE : - That's fair. - Yeah.
UNK: If you don't stop whining, I won't show you what's behind this door.
BAILEY : And trust me, you want to see what's behind this door.
PETE : Excuse me, doctors, you're going to have to wait a few minutes.
UNK: - He's got to pee. Every five minutes. - I've always had a small bladder.
UNK: I can't live like this any longer!
UNK: - I put up with your whining. - Like what you're doing now?
PETE : - It's going to go all over your leg. - So what else is new?
UNK: Now which one ofyou thinks that Yang got the better case?
BAILEY : That's what I thought.
