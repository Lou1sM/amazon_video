George : I need you to start liking my wife, because sometimes I don't
George : and I need you to talk me back into it, that's the job.
Izzie : - OK. - I need to vent and to be OK.
Izzie : OK.
George : And I need to vent with alcohol.
George : I got married and I'm scared it was a bad idea.
Izzie : Nobody ever got married and didn't think that at least once.
Derek : Did you find the fuse box?
Thatcher : Yeah, yeah, I just needed to...
Derek : Take a break?
Thatcher : I don't know how to...
Thatcher : ...what to talk to her about.
Derek : Work's a good place to start. Yeah, she's proud of what she does.
Derek : She's good at it, too. I'd start with that.
Thatcher : You get each other, that's nice.
Derek : Some days it's nice.
Derek : Some days I'd like to come home to someone
Derek : who doesn't know a thing about it.
Thatcher : Rough day?
Derek : I almost lost a friend in my own OR.
Thatcher : Was it your fault?
Meredith : I don't know.
Derek : You were both nervous tonight. It'll get easier.
Thatcher : - She was nervous? - Yeah.
Derek : She's tough, she tries to hide it.
Derek : She's difficult, but if you make an effort, she's worth it.
UNK: - You OK? - Not entirely.
Derek : She's worth the effort.
Susan : All right.
UNK: Oh, nice.
Izzie : Oh.
Mark : - Damn it. - Gotta go back in?
Alex : Yeah.
Helen : Why is there an 11 inch incision in my chest?
Derek : You coded on the table, air embolus. I had to open you up and aspirate.
Helen : See, I'm sure you did a great job,
Helen : but that's why you're gonna have real trouble
Helen : convincing me to do it again.
UNK: Helen... we got it all.
Derek : The tumor, we never have to go back in there again.
Mark : - You sure? - I'm sure.
Derek : You're gonna live a long, long life.
Helen : And here I thought you were just being an ass.
Derek : I was an ass.
Derek : I had no right to push you like that.
Helen : No, you did not.
Derek : I was going through some stuff and... I was an ass.
Helen : OK, but in this moment,
Helen : you're the ass who gave me my life back.
Susan : - I am so glad we did this. - I am, too.
UNK: Thank you for suggesting it, I...
Susan : You never would have in a million years.
Richard : - Good night. - Thank you, good night.
Thatcher : I'm sorry about your mother.
Jane : Thank you.
UNK: Swing's still here.
UNK: Yes, it, uh, doesn't swing. Nobody uses it.
Izzie : Here.
Thatcher : I put this in there, you used to catch your fingers.
Izzie : Suck it up. Go back with your tail between your legs and just apologize.
Cristina : - No! - Just say "I'm sorry, I'm an ass. "
George : - I'm always apologizing. - Blah, blah, blah and it's all over.
UNK: No, I can't be wrong all the time.
UNK: Is that really possible? No, don't.
Izzie : - Don't be grabby. - I don't have any.
UNK: Bogey.
Izzie : Maybe you're wrong all the time, maybe she's just insecure.
Izzie : It doesn't matter, you still have to grovel.
George : She's insecure,
George : that is a fact.
George : She's insecure.
Izzie : What?
Izzie : What? Just tell me.
Izzie : Come on, come on.
UNK: No. It's, um, just... nothing, just that
George : she thinks you have feelings for me and that's the problem.
UNK: I love that. That's fabulous.
UNK: And... And... And that, I... I desperately want you.
Izzie : I'm crying.
Izzie : Is she crazy?
George : I think she's maybe a little crazy.
Izzie : - I can't breathe, I can't breathe. - Shh. Shh.
UNK: We got to be quiet. Shh! Ow!
Alex : - Scary day, huh? - Yeah.
UNK: Your amniotic sac is intact, placentas in good position.
Alex : Dr. Montgomery sewed your cervix up tight, nothings coming out of there.
UNK: So, the baby's gonna be OK?
Alex : We're gonna have to see how it goes.
Alex : I'm sorry. You asked me what I thought and I told you to go for it.
UNK: I'm... I'm really sorry.
Jane : It's not your fault.
Alex : No, see, when I pulled you out of that water at the ferry...
Alex : ...I talked to you like you were my sister and I shouldn't have.
Alex : I'm an intern, you've gotta get your medical advice from an attending.
UNK: I asked you 'cause I trust you.
Jane : Why don't you sit and tell me a bedtime story or something?
UNK: What's worse?
MVO : New wounds which are so horribly painful...
Meredith : Move over, you're in the middle of the bed.
MVO : ...or old wounds that should have healed years ago and never did.
Cristina : Am I gonna screw up this engagement?
Meredith : I don't know, do you want to?
Meredith : I don't know.
Meredith : My mom is dead.
Cristina : Yeah, she is.
MVO : Maybe our old wounds teach us something...
MVO : ...they remind us of where we've been and what we've overcome.
MVO : They teach us lessons about what to avoid in the future.
MVO : That's what we like to think.
MVO : But that's not the way it is, is it?
UNK: Some things we just have to learn
MVO : over and over and over again.
