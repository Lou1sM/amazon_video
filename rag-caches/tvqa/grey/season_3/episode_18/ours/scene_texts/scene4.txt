Richard : It's not a good feeling.

UNK: You deserve to have a family whether you like them or not.
Addison : Thought we had a deal?
Mark : We agreed I wouldn't sleep with anybody, never said I wouldn't look.

George : ...it's not fantastic.
Izzie : - Cristina did Colin Marlow! - Callie's rich.
George : - Don't talk to her about it. - "Her?" I don't have a name?
UNK: "Don't tell anyone," my words.
Izzie : - So, she's rich. - Just shut up about it.
George : Do you think that's possible?
