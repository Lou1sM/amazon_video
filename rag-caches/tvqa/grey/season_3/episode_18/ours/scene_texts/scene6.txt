Richard : He's lucky it didn't travel down to his aorta.
Richard : OK, little suction there.
UNK: Almost... I got it.
Richard : Get that back, the patient wants it.
Izzie : - He's got a warped sense of nostalgia. - I get it.
UNK: Pull a bullet out of me, I'd cast it in gold and mount it.
Izzie : Yeah, well, you can afford it.
Richard : A little more suction, let's get ready to close.
Derek : She's not responding. I'm gonna open her up.
Colin : Open cardiac massage? You're a neurosurgeon.
Derek : You have no privileges in this hospital.
Nurse : - Page Dr. Burke? - No, I got it.
Colin : Cross clamp, you don't want air in the arteries.
UNK: Give me a ten blade, quickly. O'Malley, get over here.
Derek : Let's roll her, ready, one, two, three, go.
Derek : OK, rib spreader.
Derek : Scissors.
Derek : Massage the heart, O'Malley.
Derek : I need to aspirate.
Colin : - Any air return? - 10 cc.
UNK: - End title CO2's starting to go up. - Heart's starting to beat.
George : Pressure's 60 over 40. It's low but it's there.
Colin : She's gonna make it.
George : Should I start closing her up?
George : Dr. Shepherd?
Derek : O'Malley, I just sliced my friend's chest open, give me a moment.
Colin : That's very well handled, Dr. Shepherd. Very impressive indeed.
UNK: Not something to do every day, thank you.
