Meredith : Not to mention stubble cures
Meredith : because it's now become physically impossible for me to kiss your face.
UNK: I am too tired to shave!
UNK: Sloan! Dr. Sloan. Bone dry cappuccino.
Alex : I watched them make it this time, so no mistakes.
UNK: I noticed you had a reconstructive rhinoplasty today,
Alex : and I'd really like to scrub in if at all possible.
UNK: You've been working with Addison this week?
Alex : Yes, sir. Working. Working a lot.
UNK: Working hard. Just working.
Mark : - Is she miserable? - I'm sorry?
Mark : It's just...
Mark : I need to know if she's at least miserable this week.
UNK: Did she seem...?
Mark : - Is she miserable? - Well, dude, she's awful.
Alex : She's torturing me. I have to get away from that woman.
UNK: I mean, she's completely and utterly 100 percent miserable.
Addison : Good.
Alex : - So can I scrub in? - No.
Cristina : - Are you sleeping? - I should be.
Meredith : - I haven't slept in days. - Me neither.
UNK: I can't sleep alone anymore. I used to sleep just fine.
Cristina : And then he...
UNK: God, he gets me all strung out on him and then he disappears.
Meredith : He didn't disappear. He's in the hospital.
Cristina : - I just want to know how he's doing. - You could just ask him.
UNK: He could just tell me!
Meredith : George's dad is going into renal failure.
Cristina : - I heard. - My dad's here.
Meredith : Everywhere, every day.
Meredith : He's perfectly healthy, and I have nothing to say to him.
Meredith : - If George's dad dies... - I know.
Meredith : If Thatcher died, my life wouldn't be any different.
Meredith : Is it weird that I'm a little jealous of George?
Addison : Yes.
UNK: Bailey re-intubated him, but he was without oxygen for, I don't know...
UNK: - ... a few minutes. - O'Malley.
Burke : There's no blame here.
Burke : Your father's body is diseased and has undergone tremendous trauma.
Burke : Now his organs are shutting down.
Burke : - There's no blame here. - Do people come back from this?
UNK: His BUN and creatinine are high, I get that.
UNK: I'm just wondering, in your experience, can people come back from this?
Burke : I don't have any statistics.
Burke : I don't have any more medicine for you.
Burke : Now it's about faith.
George : We're men of science.
Burke : In my experience, science is not enough, O'Malley.
Burke : But if you want me to hope with you,
Burke : if you'd like me to send up a prayer, that is a thing I'd be happy to do.
Louise : You have family here?
UNK: Mrs. Douglas : - Yeah, a daughter. She's 17. - Oh, I'm so sorry.
UNK: Mrs. Douglas : Yeah... She had surgery on her spine.
UNK: And they said it went well,
UNK: Mrs. Douglas : but then she has trouble with her kidneys, and...
UNK: Mrs. Douglas : Well, she hasn't woken up.
Louise : My husband, either.
UNK: Mrs. Douglas : It was a dangerous surgery. They told us that.
Louise : My husband's, too.
Louise : He has cancer so...
Louise : I was surprised when they went through with it.
Louise : I thought I'd be taking him home.
UNK: Excuse me. Mrs. Douglas?
Izzie : Heather is asking for you.
Louise : - She woke up? - She did.
Izzie : - And she looks great. - Congratulations.
UNK: - That's wonderful. - Good luck.
Richard : I'll...
UNK: Mrs. Douglas : - Good luck. - Thanks.
George : - Why did you do it? - Dr. O'Malley.
UNK: Why did you do the surgery once you saw the cancer had spread?
Izzie : George.
George : He asked you, right?
George : He asked you to do it no matter what?
