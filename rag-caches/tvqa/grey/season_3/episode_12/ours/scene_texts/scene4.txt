Richard : Dr. Bailey, you have a lot more hands-on hours these days than I do.
Richard : I'll be standing by to help, but this is all yours.
Bailey : All right, Grey, let me have an eight-0 ET tube.
Richard : Dr. Bailey. This is a patient.
Richard : Like any other patient. There's no room for error.
Richard : Which means there's no room for nerves. So shake it off.
Bailey : All right. Let's do this.
UNK: Great. Eight up.
Bailey : - I can't... - Is it too tight?
UNK: I can't get past the vocal cords. Damn it!
Richard : - Pulse ox down to 88. - Damn it.
UNK: Eighty-six. Come on. Let's go.
UNK: Let me have a seven and a half.
UNK: - Hurry. - Come on, come on, come on.
Addison : Good.
UNK: - Let me get in. - OK. I got it.
Richard : Beautiful job. Beautiful job.
Meredith : Can I go tell George?
UNK: Dr. Bailey, you all right?
Bailey : My son is named after his son. I just need a minute.

Meredith : Sure. And while we're at it, let's look at halitosis cures for you.
