Mark : She told you.
George : Uh...
Addison : Yeah.
Mark : You think I'd be a terrible father?
UNK: Oh, I don't... I don't... Are you...?
Callie : - OK, do you like kids? - I don't know.
Mark : Depends on how loud they are.
Callie : OK. Do you like your family?
Callie : I mean, are you a family kind of guy?
Mark : I don't really have a family.
Mark : - Derek was my family. - OK.
Callie : Well, what about birthdays and anniversaries?
UNK: - Do you remember those sorts of things? - No.
Mark : - I don't know. Sometimes. - Hmm.
UNK: - Isn't it the same with all men? - No.
Callie : Some men just like kids. To some men, family's everything.
Izzie : Right.
Mark : - And you know these men? - I do.
Callie : I know one.
Mark : I would've made a terrible father.
Ronny : You're saying...
UNK: You're saying it's not getting better.
Louise : You're saying he's not going to wake up.
UNK: They stand in a line outside his room : Mrs. O'Malley, all of his organs are shutting down.
Richard : His liver and his kidneys are no longer supporting him.
UNK: He's entirely dependent upon his life-support machines.
UNK: We're saying he's not going to wake up.
UNK: You can keep him on life-support and wait for nature to take its course.
UNK: That can take days or weeks.
UNK: Or you can take him off life-support.
Louise : - Unplug him? - Yes, ma'am.
Izzie : - George? - Yeah.
Jerry : What do you think?
George : Dad's in pain.
Burke : His organs are shutting down. He can't breathe on his own.
George : It's painful.
George : And he's on medication, but...
George : ...medication can only do so much.
Jerry : You think...?
UNK: You're saying you think it's time?
Louise : To let him go?
Bailey : We can't tell you what to do here, George.
George : He's not dad like this.
George : And he's not going to wake up, Mom.
Meredith : Is there a drawer of unopened cards somewhere?
Alex : I'm sorry?
Meredith : I just... wanted to know.
Meredith : I've only ever heard my mother's version of the story of why you left.
UNK: And I was just wondering if, maybe, you have a side that I haven't heard.
Thatcher : Your mother moved to Boston, and...
Addison : I wanted to.
Thatcher : But she told me not to call or come around,
UNK: and, uh, she was, uh...
Thatcher : Eventually, I remarried.
Bailey : And I...
Bailey : I'm sorry.
Meredith : - Do you snore? - What?
Meredith : It appears that I snore.
Meredith : My mother never did, so I was just...
Meredith : - Forget it. - I snore.
Thatcher : Snore like a trucker.
Thatcher : You get that from me.
Thatcher : The wax earplugs work pretty good.
Louise : Thanks.
