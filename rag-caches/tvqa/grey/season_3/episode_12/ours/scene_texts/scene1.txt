UNK: Yeah. No, she's out of the woods.
Meredith : - How am I related to that man? - What do you mean?
UNK: - No, no, no. - Look at him. He's a mess.
George : Yeah...?
Meredith : I mean, he's a disaster. A stammering, mumbling, clumsy disaster
Meredith : with whom I have absolutely nothing in common. Not one thing.
Izzie : I hate to break this to you...
Derek : - What? - You do your own share of stammering.
Izzie : That nervous talking thing you do, it's actually a lot like him.
UNK: - Right. I'm so happy. - No, it's not.
Cristina : - Plus that messy thing. - Totally.
Meredith : - You're the messy one. - No, no. My apartment's messy.
UNK: My locker's messy. But I am not messy.
Cristina : Sometimes you have, like, food and stuff in your hair.
Izzie : Yeah, food.
Izzie : Band-Aids on your face. I can see that indentation
UNK: from the nose strip you were wearing last night.
Meredith : You are in a relationship with no words.
Meredith : And you are a millionaire in $20 shoes. So, whatever.
Cristina : Oh, my God.
Cristina : - She's just like him. - Right?
UNK: - Dr. Bailey, you paged me? - Yes, I did.
Derek : We're going to proceed with Heather's surgery as scheduled.
UNK: The insurance company changed their mind?
UNK: No, better.
Bailey : It seems an anonymous donor has offered to foot Heather's entire bill.
Izzie : Wow. That is incredible. You're a very lucky girl.
UNK: It's the first time anyone's ever said that sentence to me in my entire life.
Heather : I like it.
UNK: You spent three hundred grand so you could scrub in on this surgery?
Meredith : - No. - No?
UNK: I spent the three... Have you seen that girl?
Izzie : Her life is miserable. She's desperate.
Izzie : She'll never have a date.
Izzie : She'll never wear high heels, never feel normal.
UNK: I spent three hundred grand because it's a good thing.
