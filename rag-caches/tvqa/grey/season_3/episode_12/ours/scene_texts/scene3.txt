Meredith : Laura Grey. Tiny baby.
UNK: Laura. The baby. Right. She's, uh, doing fine.
Alex : She's doing well.
UNK: I got to get out of gynie, though. I got to get back to Sloan.
Christina : What are you plotting, and can I get in on it?
Izzie : - Shut up. - Oh!
Izzie : This is my surgery. I should be down there.
George : No. Excuse me.
Meredith : - Mr. O'Malley. - 911?
Addison : Yeah.
UNK: - That sucks. - Yeah.
Derek : - Give me the retractor. - Can you proceed without me?
Derek : Are you kidding me? This is your surgery, Torres.
Derek : This is your find. You want to leave?
UNK: I am... I don't, but, yes. I'm sorry.
UNK: But, if it's all right, I need to leave.
Derek : Give me some sponges.
Bailey : I called the family in because I need to perform a procedure on your father
Bailey : to help him breathe.
Ronny : So you're saying he can't breathe?
Bailey : With the extensive surgery, your father is not breathing on his own,
Bailey : which is why we still have him intubated.
Jerry : - Intubated? - The tube in dad's mouth.
George : It's breathing for him.
Bailey : And, right now, that tube has a kink in it, which is straining his breathing.
Louise : - How did it get a kink in it? - It just happens.
George : - We don't always know why. - But he's doing good today.
Ronny : I mean, he made plenty of pee...
Bailey : Still, we need to replace the tube.
Ronny : Why don't you just do it? What are we waiting for?
Bailey : OK. With the damage to your father's esophagus,
Bailey : and the swelling in his throat from being intubated...
George : You might not be able to get it in? The new tube.
Bailey : Under these circumstances, it can be a complicated procedure.
Bailey : If I'm not successful...
UNK: I'm saying, uh, you need to prepare yourselves.
Louise : - What is that? - It's Jerry.
Jerry : I'm sorry. I'm nervous.
UNK: - Oh, God! - My God.
UNK: - God, stop it, Jerry! - I'm nervous!
UNK: For God's sake, take some charcoal or something, son.
UNK: That's disgusting!
UNK: Shh!
Cristina : - Tyler. - Yeah?
Cristina : Could you let Dr. Burke know
UNK: that Mr. O'Malley is having some kind of medical crisis right now,
UNK: and I thought he would like to know?
Tyler : He's awake, you know.
Cristina : Yeah, I know.
