Alex : Hey.
Addison : Derek.
Burke : I was waiting on an update on Mr. O'Malley.
Burke : I didn't want to intrude, but do you have an update?
Derek : They're letting him go.
UNK: Hm.
UNK: I haven't had any more tremors.
Burke : Not one all week.
Derek : How about that?
UNK: Yeah. How about that?
UNK: And I'm not going to give up either part of me.
Izzie : And I'm not going to apologize for it.
Christina : There's a club.
Christina : The Dead Dad's Club. And you can't be in it until you're in it.
UNK: You can try to understand, you can sympathize.
Christina : But until you feel that loss...
UNK: My dad died when I was nine.
Izzie : George...
Christina : I'm really sorry you had to join the club.
UNK: I don't know how to exist in the world where my dad doesn't...
Christina : Yeah, that never really changes.
Alex : Beer, Joe, please.
Joe : George's dad?
Alex : Hey.
Alex : Hey.
Addison : You got a dad?
UNK: Not really. Not anymore.
