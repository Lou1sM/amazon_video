Cathy : You know what I mean?
Callie : - Mrs. Rogerson... - I know I'm gonna die.
Cathy : You know, maybe not today, but soon.
UNK: I just need to talk, you know?
Cathy : Nina won't let me talk.
Cathy : I just need to talk.
Richard : No coffee.
UNK: One more thing for Marlowe to tweak.
Richard : Please tell me you're not coming up with a 10 year plan for this hospital.
UNK: You can me up with all the plans you want, but in the end, it just...
Derek : Doesn't make one bit of difference.
Derek : - Things happen. People just... - Drown?
Derek : Yeah, you know, when I pulled her out of the water, it was...
Derek : She was like ice.
Derek : She can swim.
UNK: Richard, she's...
Derek : She gave up.
UNK: I close my eyes for a moment, it's like she's back in the water.
UNK: I'm up, and I just listen to her breathe, you know?
Izzie : Just...
Derek : In case she stops.
UNK: So I can come up with plans for the hospital, but...
Derek : But if they ask me where I'm gonna be in ten years...
Meredith : George.
George : Mr. Torres.
UNK: You want to take care of her in your own way.
UNK: Mr. Torres : I understand that.
UNK: Mr. Torres : I respect it.
UNK: Mr. Torres : But you have to understand,
UNK: Mr. Torres : she's my only little girl, George.
UNK: And you need to promise me that you will love her and protect her,
UNK: because the minute that you hurt her...
UNK: Mr. Torres : You understand?
Callie : Good.
UNK: Mr. Torres : Then I'll tell Callie's mother she can plan the party.
UNK: What pa... what?
UNK: Your wedding party.
UNK: - Oh, dad, come on. - Oh, no, please, Mija. For my sanity,
UNK: Mija, just let her plan a party.
UNK: All right, all right. Okay.
Mark : All right.
UNK: Mr. Torres : I have a plane to catch.
Colin : Come here.
Meredith : George.
Callie : Bye, dad.
Callie : You stood up to him. Nobody does that.
Callie : I was all proud.
Callie : So listen...
UNK: About last night, I don't know about you, but personally
UNK: I'd like to take back about 90% of it.
George : Me, too.
Callie : Good.
UNK: Good. Okay. Then go...
Callie : Go find Izzie and help her prep Mrs. Rogerson. I'll see you in surgery.
Jane : You here to keep my baby alive?
Derek : I am.
Callie : Good.
Alex : So?
Izzie : So...
UNK: Call me Ava.
Mark : You been practicing? You know the chief will be watching today.
Meredith : The chief. Right. Of course.
UNK: "Of course" what?
Meredith : Derek was right about you.
Meredith : You're using the memory of my dead mother
Meredith : to win points with the chief.
Meredith : It's despicable,
Meredith : and I'm not gonna play.
Derek : The chief...
Mark : The way he was looking at you this morning...
Mark : Was like you were some beaten down puppy he picked up off the side of the road.
Mark : You do this procedure
Mark : and you do it well,
Mark : he'll start looking at you like a surgeon again.
UNK: But, you know...
Mark : You wanna think of me as despicable,
Mark : you wanna pass up this shot, that's up to you.
Cristina : They're doing amazing things with prosthetics these days.
Cristina : This doesn't mean your life is over.
UNK: Uh, take him up to the O.R. I'll meet you there.
UNK: You've got your board thing now?
Cristina : The chief picked you...
Cristina : Originally. You were always supposed to be the next chief. That was the plan.
Burke : That was a long time ago.
Burke : A lot has happened since then.
Cristina : But you're still that guy.
