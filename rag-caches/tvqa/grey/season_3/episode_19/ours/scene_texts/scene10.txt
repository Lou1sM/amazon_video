UNK: I should've brought her in sooner...
Nina : The first time she threw up.
Nina : I knew better.
Callie : - Nina, there was nothing any of us could... - No.
Nina : It was a mistake.
Derek : Your mother...
Izzie : Talked to me.
Izzie : She wasn't ready to leave you, but she was ready to leave her body.
Richard : Please.
Nina : I don't need you to explain the relative comforts of death for my mother.
Izzie : What she was afraid of
Izzie : was that you had taken on so much of her disease that you were freezing up, too.
UNK: You've spent so much time planning and...
Izzie : Helping her avoid risk... God knows, that's
UNK: what you should've been doing... but...
Izzie : She was worried.
Izzie : You have a healthy body, Nina. If you fall down, you won't turn to stone.
UNK: And your mom so wanted you to just let yourself fall.
Izzie : Messing up...
UNK: It's what makes a person.
UNK: It's how we learn...
UNK: Where we find joy...
Izzie : In the things you don't plan for,
Izzie : the things you never see coming.
UNK: Okay. It happened.
Izzie : It was a mistake, and it happened. People make mistakes.
Izzie : We need to figure out where we go from here.
Izzie : We need to figure out how to tell Callie.
George : I'm not gonna tell Callie.
George : Do you know how much this would hurt her?
George : .I'm not gonna clear my conscience at her expense
George : She has done nothing but
George : support me, encourage me and believe in me, and this is how I pay her back?
George : No, I have to live with what I did.
UNK: This is our secret, okay?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: The thing about plans is,
UNK: they don't take into account the unexpected.
UNK: So when we're thrown a curveball
UNK: whether it's in the O.R. Or in life...
Cristina : How are you feeling?
UNK: We have to improvise.
Doug : I'm a guy without a foot.
Doug : What do I do now?
Cristina : You move forward, you...
Cristina : You follow the plan, and you try and keep your other foot.
Doug : My other foot.
Meredith : Right.
UNK: Of course, some of us are better at it than others.
Addison : I'm impressed, Karev.
Addison : You spent the whole day watching a fetal monitor and never complained.
Alex : - Well, I do what I'm told. - Since when?
Alex : Depends on who's doing the telling.
Addison : Good night, Dr. Karev.
Jane : What was that?
UNK: Hey, how's... Ava?
Jane : I don't think I'm gonna know the answer to that for a little while.
Jane : What do you say we talk about you and the redhead instead?
Alex : Well, the redhead's my boss, so...
Alex : - So? - So it's complicated.
UNK: Mr. Torres : - And? - And...
UNK: Some of us just have to move on to plan B...
UNK: and make the best of it.
Cristina : It has to be small... Just you and me...
UNK: And Meredith... And.. And Shepherd, too, if you want. But that's it.
UNK: And a justice of the peace. I know you're...
Cristina : spiritual and stuff, but
UNK: I... I don't want any rabbis or ministers, nothing religious.
UNK: We'll just...
Cristina : make an appointment at city hall, and
UNK: that'll be that.
Cristina : And no veil.
UNK: I don't want to get married with mosquito net all over my face.
UNK: I let Mark use the memory of my mother to win points with the chief.
Meredith : You were right.
Cristina : I'm sorry.
Meredith : - You know what's weird? - What's weird?
Meredith : It's exactly what she would have wanted.
Derek : - Dead mommy's proud? - Dead mommy's proud.
Meredith : How was your interview?
Derek : Not great
Derek : It wasn't great.
Derek : I was distracted.
Meredith : By what?
Colin : Nothing.
Jane : I don't know.
Derek : On a scale of one to ten, how bad is it?
UNK: Eight.
UNK: How about now?
Meredith : Seven.
UNK: And sometimes...
UNK: How about now?
Meredith : Six
UNK: What we want
UNK: Five.
UNK: Is exactly what we need. - Four, three...
UNK: But sometimes...
UNK: I can smell your clothes through the closet door.
Callie : Did you tie them up in a plastic laundry bag?
Izzie : Yeah.
Cristina : I'm sorry.
George : I'm so sorry.
UNK: Well, I guess I can... live with it.
UNK: Sometimes what we need
UNK: is a new plan.
