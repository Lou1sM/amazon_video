CHIEF : You want to talk about it, Addie,
CHIEF : or you just want to be glib a little longer?
ADDISON : Why are you living in your office?
CHIEF : Marriage is hard.
ADDISON : Well, thank goodness mine seems to be just about over.
UNK: Ms. Seabury, what...?
UNK: What are...? No, I'm sorry, you cannot be eating.
CHIEF : What is all this?
UNK: MS. SEABURY : Except for maybe the banana cream torte there. It's pretty stunning.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : Bakeries deliver. Please grab a fork.
CHIEF : You're scheduled for surgery this afternoon.
UNK: We push the surgery. Tomorrow maybe? Oh, my God, you've got to taste this!
BAILEY : Ma'am, you have an aggressive form of lung cancer.
BAILEY : The sooner we get you into surgery...
UNK: "The better your chances of surviving. " So I heard. It's all very aggressive.
UNK: It's funny.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : I have never smoked a cigarette in my life.
UNK: I have never smoked pot.
UNK: I never drank.
UNK: Before today, I hadn't had a dessert in 10 years. I am the picture of health.
UNK: And I have lung cancer. I mean come on, it's absurd, right?
BAILEY : I'm sorry.
UNK: I think I'm on a sugar high. I'm sorry.
CHIEF : O'Malley, reschedule her surgery for tomorrow.
CHIEF : - And get her a psych consult. - Yes, sir.
CHIEF : - And no more food deliveries. - Yes, sir.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : OK.
UNK: So... um... Dr. Bailey?
UNK: Surgeons don't say "um. " You wanna be a surgeon, learn to speak like one.
ALEX : He wants you to talk to the chief about Izzie.
UNK: She's baking, a lot of baking, and it seems a waste for all her talent
GEORGE : and medical skills to go into muffins.
UNK: - We just thought you might help... - Stop talking.
DEREK : Well, good morning. Benjamin, Ruth.
DEREK : - Good morning. - Doesn't feel like a very good morning.
BENJAMIN : I have to have brain surgery today. Pretty scary.
BENJAMIN : Plus, my sister's nervous, and so she sweats,
BENJAMIN : and the windows in here don't open so it's pretty rank.
DEREK : - Benjamin. - Was I rude, Ruthie?
RUTH : - Let's let the doctors talk. - Benjamin O'Leary, 32.
CHRISTINA : In for the removal of a brain tumor pressing on his frontal temporal lobe.
CHRISTINA : It's effecting his impulse control.
UNK: It makes me say everything I think, which apparently is annoying.
BEN : This doctor looks annoyed anyway.
UNK: Although it's hard to tell. She always has a pinched, uptight look on her face.
BEN : - Am I annoying you? - It's fine.
RUTH : You can't say it's fine. He doesn't perceive sarcasm or irony.
RUTH : If he's annoying you, you have to tell him.
BEN : - Maybe I'm not annoying her. - No, you are.
BAILEY : - Dr. Yang. - He asked.
DEREK : OK, Dr. Yang, pinched and annoyed though she may be,
UNK: is gonna prep you for surgery. Do you have any questions?
BEN : Is that blonde your girlfriend? The way you look at her,
BEN : you might as well mount her right here and now.
BEN : I'm sorry, was that rude?
BAILEY : I'm proud of you all. You make me proud.
BAILEY : You reflect on me well.
BAILEY : Grey, if you think you can keep your clothes on long enough
BAILEY : to follow up the labs, I'd appreciate it.
UNK: Karev, cover the pit.
UNK: Wait, the pit? I'm off Gyne?
