NURSE : You're blocking our path. Please!
UNK: - Are you OK? - Sir.
UNK: MR. MARLEY : You son of a bitch. Where's my son?
BAILEY : We took him in there.
UNK: - He was blocking them! - He is terrified. His child is a tree!
BAILEY : Listen to me. You will not get physical
BAILEY : with another human being on my watch ever again.
BAILEY : You will not question my authority. You will not defend your girlfriend
BAILEY : for killing a man. Are we clear?
ALEX : She's not my girlfriend.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : As you know, I'm sure, he graduated first in his class from Tulane.

CHRISTINA : Married? I'm sorry, married?
UNK: Come, Cristina. You must have considered the possibility.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : You're no spring chicken.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : I don't know a young woman who wouldn't want to marry my Preston.

UNK: MRS. BURKE : Preston, what on Earth are you doing out of bed?
CHRISTINA : Oh...
CHRISTINA : Well, I...
BURKE : I wanted to... get some...
UNK: I... Stretch my legs, Mama.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : But you're not supposed to stretch your legs.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : You're supposed to be resting.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : Right.
UNK: But I wanted to have some air.

UNK: MRS. BURKE : You did this.
UNK: - Did what? - Cristina, listen to me.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : It's not that I don't like you.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : I think that you're a very smart, very attractive young woman.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : - But you're selfish. - I beg your pardon.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : You pulled him out of his sick bed because you were uncomfortable.

UNK: MRS. BURKE : Not much longer.
UNK: Hey, hey, hi. All right. All right.
BURKE : I brought you a scone, Mama.

MEREDITH : She was fun. A lot less angry.
