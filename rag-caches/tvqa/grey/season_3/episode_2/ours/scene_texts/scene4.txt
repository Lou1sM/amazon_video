RUTH : - That was rude, Benjamin. - It is?
MEREDITH : No, actually, it's true, and it's refreshing.
UNK: - You have sex with that brain surgeon? - Benjamin...
UNK: It's OK. Nope. I haven't.
MEREDITH : - Not today anyway. - I would.
UNK: He's hot. And arrogant, in a way that's still sexy.
UNK: I would totally have sex with him if I could. Looked like you could.
UNK: So what's the holdup?
CALLIE : - You trying to seduce me? - I was wondering...
UNK: I got a lot of work to do, but I was just wondering about the panties.
GEORGE : Panties that are yours, and how they ended up on the bulletin board.
GEORGE : Black lacy panties on the board.
CALLIE : - You are trying to seduce me. - No.
GEORGE : No, I'm not. I'm just wondering how panties I haven't seen before...
GEORGE : And I've seen your panties a lot of days in a row.
UNK: I'm wondering how black panties that apparently belong to you
UNK: end up on a bulletin board.
UNK: Wow, you're jealous.
UNK: - No. No, no, no. I'm not... - Yeah.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, you are.
UNK: Is that my patient? Ms. Seabury?
UNK: Ms. Seabury? Hey! Stop! Get...
MEREDITH : - I'll tell him. - What?
UNK: - The truth about the panties. - Don't you dare.
CALLIE : He is jealous.
ALEX : So you and O'Malley, huh? How'd that happen?
CALLIE : You're a surgeon, how'd that happen?
BAILEY : Karev, she's a resident. She outranks you.
UNK: You don't ask personal questions.
CHRISTINA : - It's fine. - He's my intern, I say it's not fine.
BAILEY : - Are we clear? - No.
BAILEY : What's not clear?
ALEX : Why you won't talk to Izzie. That's what's not clear.
UNK: Really? You want to push me on this? Today? Today you want to push me?
UNK: What do we got, Jill?
UNK: Harley Hernandez was street-luging when he lost control and hit a car.
Jill : Witnesses say he was catapulted 20 feet into the air.
UNK: Landed on tree trimmings. Broken pelvis is apparent,
Jill : as are, I would guess, some massive internal injuries.
BAILEY : You would guess?
UNK: Harley, you're at the hospital. We're gonna take care of you now.
MARLEY : hospital? What's the matter with me?
UNK: MR. MARLEY : - You're an idiot, that's what. - Dad?
BAILEY : - Back away. - Your friends are idiots,
UNK: MR. MARLEY : and you don't use the sense God gave you.
