CHRISTINA : Next time I see her, if she even looks at me sideways,
CHRISTINA : I'm telling her what I think. She wants to call me racist?
CHIEF : - What? - Yeah. I'll call her sexist.
CHRISTINA : Change my career after I'm married?
CHRISTINA : What is this, 1953?
CHRISTINA : She comes at me, I'm going there.
MEREDITH : - I think you should. - Mmm-hmm.
MEREDITH : I think we all should just go there.
MEREDITH : You know, tell the truth. Spit it out.
MEREDITH : Go with your gut. Follow your instincts.
CHRISTINA : I miss philandering whore Meredith.
UNK: She was trashy and much less idyllic.
GEORGE : Do women have two sets of panties?
UNK: Two sets they wear for different occasions?
MEREDITH : I made a choice. I'm picking Derek.
MEREDITH : Finn is great. But Derek is... Derek.
MEREDITH : And I'm following my gut.
CHRISTINA : Whatever.
CHRISTINA : I want my patient back.
CHRISTINA : You know, the one you stole after... Mama cornered me?
UNK: That's fine. It's my day to check on Izzie anyway.
GEORGE : You paged me?
NURSE : Your patient was caught shoplifting chocolate from the hospital gift shop.
CHIEF : - What? - Never done that.
UNK: MRS SEABURY : - It was exhilarating. - And now she's planning to leave.
UNK: Leave? You can't... She can't leave.
GEORGE : You're sick. You should be sleeping. Resting.
UNK: MRS SEABURY : - Preparing for death? - For surgery.
GEORGE : - There's a difference. - Maybe. Maybe not.
UNK: MRS SEABURY : That's what they mean when they give you a 60 percent chance of survival.
UNK: Means four out of ten people die whether they have the surgery or not.
UNK: MRS SEABURY : I have lived my entire life pent-up, repressed.
UNK: MRS SEABURY : Stifling every impulse, following every rule. Now I'm done.
UNK: And you know what? You should be too. We should all be done.
GEORGE : - So you're leaving? - I'm claiming my life.
UNK: - I can't do that from a hospital bed. - You know you'll die.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : Maybe.
UNK: MRS SEABURY : But at least when I do, I'll know that I have lived.
UNK: MRS SEABURY : Oh, God, this is good.
MEREDITH : Izzie?
CALLIE : Wow.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : OK.
MEREDITH : - Finn. - Hi.
UNK: Why are you home? I thought you were working.
MEREDITH : I am. I was. I still am.
MEREDITH : I just came home to check on Izzie.
FINN : So did I.
FINN : Brought her lunch.
MEREDITH : You brought Izzie lunch?
FINN : When my wife died, there really wasn't anything anyone could say.
FINN : But... the bringing of food actually helped.
FINN : The only thing that helped.
MEREDITH : - You brought Izzie food? - Yeah.
MEREDITH : Even though you didn't think I was here.
UNK: Is that OK?
BAILEY : Yeah.
MEREDITH : It's amazing, actually.
MEREDITH : You're amazing.
MEREDITH : Sweet and thoughtful. And sensitive.
FINN : Meredith, I don't want to pressure you. You have a decision to make.
FINN : I want you to take all the time you need.
FINN : But I do want to make one thing clear.
MEREDITH : What's that?
UNK: I'm not all that sensitive.
MEREDITH : So...
FINN : Have a nice day at work.
BAILEY : Mr. Hernandez?
UNK: How is he? Is he OK? You've been operating for hours.
BAILEY : There is extensive damage. We've had to remove
UNK: one of his kidneys and a portion of his bowel.
UNK: But the tree's out, and he's OK?
UNK: OK, Mr. Hernandez, the branch actually is still there.
BAILEY : We're operating around it which is what's taking so much time.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : His mother's not here yet. I mean,
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : do you think he'll be OK by the time she gets here?
BAILEY : I do have to get back in there. I just wanted to give you an update.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : - That he's still alive. - Yes, that he's still alive.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : OK.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : OK.
JOE : Izzie. How you doing, sweetie?
IZZIE : I brought you some muffins.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : - OK. - I made a lot.
IZZIE : I was running out of room and I thought maybe...
IZZIE : ...you would like some.
IZZIE : I'm a good baker.
JOE : Yeah, absolutely. Thank you.
UNK: Dr. Stevens.
UNK: Please don't call me doctor.
UNK: OK. Please don't call me Mrs. Shepherd.
ADDISON : That's funny.
IZZIE : - She's drunk. - True.
UNK: So did you know about the slutty sex
ADDISON : your slutty friend had with my super slutty husband?
IZZIE : You should have a muffin.
IZZIE : They're really good, and they'll help you.
ADDISON : I may be beyond help.
BAILEY : Yeah.
IZZIE : Me too.
IZZIE : Don't let her drive, Joe.
ADDISON : Good.
