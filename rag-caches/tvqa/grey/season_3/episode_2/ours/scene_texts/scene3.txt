DEREK : A little more public. I like it.
MEREDITH : You're married. You're married, and you said things to me.
DEREK : Yes, I said things to you.
MEREDITH : Normally, I would like the things you said to me.
UNK: I would think the bulletin board thing was funny.
CHIEF : - What? - But you're married.
MEREDITH : Which makes none of this normal. It makes me a home wrecker.
UNK: I hate the fact that I'm a home wrecker.
UNK: Meredith, I'm not gonna pressure you. Take all the time you need.
DEREK : Just so you have all the information,
UNK: my home was wrecked well before you came into the picture.
DEREK : And I am just now done trying to rebuild it.
UNK: - You're done? - I'm done.
DEREK : Whatever you decide, I'm ending it with Addison.
CHIEF : Today.
MEREDITH : You have said this before.
DEREK : I know, but this time I mean it. I'm gonna come clean,
DEREK : just as soon as I see her.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : You are?
ADDISON : I am.
CALLIE : You guys should think about getting a hotel room or something.
CHRISTINA : Your mother wants to have coffee with me.
BURKE : - And? - And she thinks I'm a racist.
CHRISTINA : Oh, and a stripper. She thinks I'm a racist stripper.
CHRISTINA : Oh, come on, what's funny? This is not funny.
UNK: Well, it's kind of funny.
UNK: She's just my mama, Cristina.
UNK: Your mama?
BURKE : You'll love her when you get to know her. Everybody loves my mama.
UNK: You will save me from this, OK?
CHRISTINA : You will save me from this or...
CHRISTINA : You will save me.
DEREK : You haven't heard from Addison, have you? She's not answering phones.
UNK: Actually, she needed a day off.
CHIEF : Something about finding another woman's panties
CHIEF : in the pocket of your tux.
DEREK : That's not how I wanted her to find out.
CHIEF : You don't leave another woman's panties in your tux
CHIEF : unless you want her to find them.
CHIEF : I know a thing or two about affairs.
UNK: Even know a thing or two about affairs with women named Grey.
DEREK : It's not an affair. I was gonna tell her.
UNK: I was gonna tell her today. I was gonna end it.
CHIEF : Give her some space. Give her some time.
UNK: No. That's not it.
UNK: No. No, I gotta talk to her today.
DEREK : If something's over, it's got to be over.
UNK: Meredith, she's... She's not an affair.
BEN : Ow!
BEN : I don't think I want this surgery.
RUTH : You have to have this surgery.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : Right.
UNK: You're very pretty but look tired and should change your hair conditioner.
