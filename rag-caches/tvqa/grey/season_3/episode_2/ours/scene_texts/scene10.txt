FINN : - Both of us? - Yes.
MEREDITH : I understand if you're not up for it.
MEREDITH : But I really hope you are.
FINN : You bowing out?
DEREK : No. You?
FINN : I don't think so.
CHIEF : You're here first.
CHIEF : You get all the best cases. Trauma comes in at night, you get first dibs.
CALLIE : Exactly.
CHIEF : I respect it. I do.
CHIEF : And also, I can't have it, and you know that.
CALLIE : - You're throwing me out. - Got no choice.
CHIEF : This violates all sorts of codes, and you know it.
UNK: So I have to go, but you're allowed to live in your office?
CHIEF : - You noticed that, huh? - I'm pretty observant.
CHIEF : Guess if I'm throwing you out I have to follow my own rules.
UNK: GEORGE with flowers for Callie : OK, I'm jealous. But I have a right to be jealous
UNK: because I don't want other guys touching your panties.
MEREDITH : Great.
GEORGE : That's great!
UNK: - You might want to clear that up. - Yes, sir.
UNK: - You headin' out? - Gotta get back to the hospital.
UNK: - Gotta go kick this cancer's ass. - All right.
UNK: Joe, what do I owe?
UNK: Hey, Alex.
BAILEY : About today...
ALEX : Dr. Bailey, you were right. I shouldn't get physical with patients.
MEREDITH : The body is a slave to its impulses.
BURKE : I don't know if it's gonna get any better, Mama.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Well, I do, baby.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : I do know.
UNK: Cristina, it's late.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Preston needs his sleep.
MEREDITH : But the thing that makes us human...
CHRISTINA : Sorry, Mrs. Burke, I was just coming to see if either of you needed anything
CHRISTINA : before I went home for the evening.
MEREDITH : ...is what we can control.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : We're fine.
CHRISTINA : Good night, Preston.
CHRISTINA : Sleep well.
UNK: Mr. BURKE : Hang in there.
MEREDITH : After the storm,
MEREDITH : after the rush,
MEREDITH : after the heat of the moment has passed...
MEREDITH : - The panties? - Yeah.
CALLIE : Not mine.
GEORGE : - Yeah? - The jealousy?
BAILEY : Yeah.
CALLIE : Insanely hot.
GEORGE : What's with the suitcase?
MEREDITH : ...we can cool off and clean up the messes we've made.
IZZIE : I'm busy you guys, leave me alone.
ALEX : Izzie.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I went soft.
BAILEY : I had a baby,
BAILEY : and I swore it wouldn't change me.
UNK: But it just... It does change you.
BAILEY : I got tired.
BAILEY : I got busy, and I stopped teaching.
BAILEY : I stopped teaching when you needed a teacher the most.
IZZIE : You couldn't have stopped me.
BAILEY : Yes, I could have. You couldn't have stopped you, but I could have.
BAILEY : And in the past, I would have.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I went soft.
BAILEY : And I'm partly to blame for what happened, so...
BAILEY : I want you to come back.
BAILEY : You'll talk to the chief. We'll work it out,
BEN : because you're... talented and you're capable,
BAILEY : and we all make mistakes.
BAILEY : And it's enough muffins.
MEREDITH : We can try to let go of what was.
ADDISON : I thought you were room service.
DEREK : I feel terrible.
DEREK : I'm not proud of what I did.
DEREK : You deserve better.
DEREK : And I'm sorry about the...
DEREK : Sorry about the panties.
DEREK : The prom.
DEREK : I'm sorry I did that.
BAILEY : Yeah.
ADDISON : I'm sorry you did that too.
DEREK : Our marriage is over.
ADDISON : Yeah, I guess it is.
DEREK : It's all my fault.
UNK: God, this is incredibly sad.
DEREK : Incredibly sad.
MEREDITH : And then again...
CHRISTINA : Oh...
MARK : ...this is awkward.
DEREK : I feel much better now.
