UNK: At any given moment, the brain has 14 billion neurons
MEREDITH : firing at a speed of 450 miles per hour.
MEREDITH : We don't have control over most of them.
UNK: When we get a chill, goose bumps.
MEREDITH : When we get excited, adrenaline.
Moloko : The Time is Now
MEREDITH : The body naturally follows its impulses,
MEREDITH : which, I think, is part of what makes it so hard for us to control ours.
IZZIE : That's enough muffins.
IZZIE : We don't need all these. No more muffins.
MEREDITH : Of course, sometimes we have impulses we would rather not control...
BURKE : What are you doing?
UNK: Just because you can't touch, doesn't mean you can't enjoy.
MEREDITH : ...that we later wish we had.
BURKE : Mama. Daddy.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Preston?
UNK: Mama, Daddy?
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Is this a new service the hospital is providing?
CHRISTINA : I told you to guard the door.
NURSE : - I had a code blue. - I had parents walk in.
NURSE : - We saved the guy's life. - I want my 20 bucks.
UNK: Sorry. Bought everyone coffee to celebrate saving the guy's life.
CHRISTINA : I want my 20 bucks back!
MEREDITH : It's not Tyler's fault you're a dirty, dirty stripper.
CHRISTINA : You heard.
MEREDITH : Everyone heard.
MEREDITH : - Stripper. - Oh, you're one to talk.
CHRISTINA : Sleeping with two men.
MEREDITH : Wrong. I'm not sleeping with either one of them.
MEREDITH : Not until I pick one.
MEREDITH : If I haven't made a decision by the end of the day, I'm flipping a coin.
UNK: A girI can only hold out for so long.
CHRISTINA : Oh, and somehow I'm the dirty stripper.
UNK: You have time to round or are you too busy getting naked on hospital property?
UNK: No, it wasn't naked. I wasn't naked!
UNK: You've got a coffee stain on your shirt.
UNK: You got a bed on your couch.
UNK: Hope you're not planning to see patients in your sweatsuit.
ADDISON : Actually... I need the day off.
UNK: A day off for what?
ADDISON : For drinking.
ADDISON : I am feeling the need to do some drinking.
ADDISON : Actually, I'm feeling the need to do some crying,
ADDISON : but my tear ducts seem to be too proud,
ADDISON : so I'm going to do some drinking instead.
CHIEF : What, no laboring moms today?
IZZIE : No.
ADDISON : Because I think God knows that I need to do some drinking today.
