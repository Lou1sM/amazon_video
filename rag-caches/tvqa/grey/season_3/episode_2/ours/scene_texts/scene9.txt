MEREDITH : In my opinion, you could keep using the darts as weapons,
MEREDITH : or you could go get lucky with a sexy, hot, dirty girI.
CHRISTINA : - Where's he going? - To get laid.
CHRISTINA : There is something wrong in the world
CHRISTINA : when Bambi's getting laid and I can't get five minutes alone with Burke.
BURKE : - What are you doing? - Day's over. Flipping a coin. Call it.
CHRISTINA : The brain surgeon should be heads.
UNK: MS. SEABURY : Right.
MEREDITH : Choice made.
UNK: Oh, that's it? You'll base your choice on flipping a coin?
MEREDITH : I'm taking a cue from Benjamin. Impulsive, honest.
UNK: It's my new motto.
CHRISTINA : Benjamin died.
CHRISTINA : He wasn't impulsive. He wasn't honest.
CHRISTINA : He was sick and brain damaged.
CHRISTINA : And now he's dead.
BAILEY : Mr. Hernandez?
BAILEY : May I?
UNK: You OK?
UNK: Your son is gonna be fine.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : He was off with his friends.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I let him go off with that thing.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I knew better.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : His friend, he has this driveway up on a hill.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I just keep picturing him.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : Keep picturing him going down that hill and...
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I didn't stop him. I should have stopped him.
BAILEY : Kids spin out of control sometimes.
BAILEY : They spin out of control. You can't...
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : Yes, you can. You can control them.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : It's your job as a parent to control them.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : Ever since the divorce, I only get to see him every other weekend.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I never would have bought him that luge,
UNK: or let him go off on his own that way before.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I went soft.
UNK: MR. HERNANDEZ : I went soft when he needed me to be the father.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : I wish I'd had more fun.
UNK: I didn't want to be a slut. I didn't want to be a tramp.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : I didn't have any fun. My ex-husband, he had fun.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : All sorts of fun with all sorts of women who were a lot more fun than me.
UNK: Nobody ever called him a slut.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : Why is that? Men can do it but women can't.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : Women can. I know some who do.
UNK: Not without getting called names.
UNK: What do you care? I get called an ass, I don't care.
UNK: I don't think you're an ass.
UNK: I don't think you're a slut.

UNK: MRS. SEABURY : I'm single too.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : And I'm very bad at this. Never have I had any practice.
ADDISON : So I'm...
UNK: I'm gonna go into the bathroom.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : And if I find myself alone in there after two minutes,
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : I'll just touch up my makeup and come back out.
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : But should you have any interest in
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : fulfilling the wish of a potentially dying woman,
UNK: MRS. SEABURY : you know where I'll be.

MEREDITH : - Derek. - Hey.
MEREDITH : Thanks for coming.
MEREDITH : Both of you, thanks for coming.
UNK: So here's the thing.
MEREDITH : I like you...
MEREDITH : ...and I like you.
MEREDITH : And I thought I had a choice to make. I thought I had to decide.
MEREDITH : But I think I owe myself the chance to consider my options.
FINN : - Options? - Options?
MEREDITH : There's this thing that allows for the considering of options.

UNK: - You wanna try dating. - Yes.
