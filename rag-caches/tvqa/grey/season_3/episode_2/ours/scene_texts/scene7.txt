UNK: But I knew, I knew that you'd...
MEREDITH : She's still here.
CHRISTINA : Never leaves.
CHRISTINA : She never even pees.
CHRISTINA : I'm not entirely sure she's human.
MEREDITH : Finn brought Izzie lunch.
CHRISTINA : - You went to see Izzie? - Yeah, she wasn't home.
MEREDITH : I'm taking that as a good thing. At least the baking has stopped.
MEREDITH : But my point is, Finn brought Izzie lunch.
UNK: He's that guy, the guy who brings your roommate lunch when she's sad.
CHRISTINA : So you didn't end it?
MEREDITH : He's the guy who brings your roommate lunch when she's sad.
UNK: - So I'm gonna end it with Derek. - Whatever.
CHRISTINA : You know, I'm not selfish.
CHRISTINA : I'm by his side.
CHRISTINA : I took off all my clothes. That's not selfish.
CHRISTINA : And I'm going in for surgery.
CHRISTINA : Selfish people don't save lives.
CHRISTINA : George.
CHIEF : - What? - You're flirting with that nurse.
GEORGE : I'm young. I'm healthy. I got a life to live.
MEREDITH : Is this about the panties? Are you still jealous?
GEORGE : I'm not jealous. I'm just living my life.
BEN : Do you have a boyfriend? Do you have a boyfriend? Do you have a boyfriend?
UNK: He's gonna keep asking till you answer.
UNK: Yes, I have a boyfriend. Look here.
BEN : If I had a boyfriend, I would definitely not be as angry as you.
BEN : Why are you so angry? Is it because you're frigid? Or he's frigid? Or..?
CHRISTINA : Nobody's frigid.
UNK: My boyfriend's mother called me selfish.
UNK: Are you selfish? You do seem kind of self-obsessed to me.
DEREK : - Ben. - I'm a surgeon.
CHRISTINA : In order to be a surgeon, a certain amount of self-obsession is necessary.
CHRISTINA : My boyfriend gets that. His mother doesn't, it's her problem.
BEN : I used to have a boyfriend. When I got the tumor, he understood.
BEN : He tried to understand. He loved me.
BEN : But his mother didn't.
BEN : My offending everyone offended her.
BEN : And he said he didn't care what his mother thought.
BEN : But in the end, he did care,
BEN : 'cause now it's two years later, and I'm having brain surgery,
BEN : and only my fat sister Ruth is with me.
CHRISTINA : Benjamin, that was kind of rude.
NURSE : Sorry.
UNK: When the tumor is removed, will it bring his old personality back?
DEREK : If we get the tumor out and Benjamin lives,
DEREK : anything else is icing on the cake.
CALLIE : Locking down the external fixator.
