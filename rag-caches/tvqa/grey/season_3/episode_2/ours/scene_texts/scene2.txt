BAILEY : Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd is out sick.
UNK: You can cover the pit, or you can...
UNK: You can tell me whose damn panties
BAILEY : are on the bulletin board?
CHRISTINA : Are those yours?
BAILEY : This is a hospital, people.
BAILEY : Serious work happens here.
BAILEY : We save lives here.
BAILEY : Oh, is something funny? Whose are these?
MEREDITH : - This is bad. This isn't good. - You better claim them.
CHRISTINA : - She thinks they're mine! Claim them! - No.
BAILEY : Yeah, I know it's one of you. It's always one of mine. Always.
BAILEY : So tell me, which one of you left your damn drawers
BAILEY : on my surgical floor?
UNK: Oh, no, did I leave my underwear Iying around again? I am so sorry, Bailey.
CALLIE : It's my bad.
BAILEY : O'Malley, Yang, prep your patient for surgery.
BAILEY : Karev, pit, Grey, charts.
BAILEY : All four of you, do not make me regret setting you loose in this hospital.
UNK: O'Malley, what do I mean by that?
GEORGE : Check with you before we cut wires or steal hearts.
BAILEY : - Are you trying to be clever? - No, ma'am.
BAILEY : Better not be.
GEORGE : Holy crap.
CHRISTINA : - The Nazi is definitely back. - Louder than ever.
UNK: Oh, Mrs. Burke. Hi, I'm Cristina.
CHRISTINA : I may have said that earlier, but...
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Did I hear you refer to Miranda Bailey as a Nazi?
IZZIE : No.
CHRISTINA : I mean, yes, but...
UNK: You understand that the Nazis were responsible
UNK: MRS. BURKE : for the worst genocide in the history of man.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : And a racist genocide at that.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : I would think that as a woman of color and a doctor, no less,
UNK: that you would think twice before using that word as a punchline.
UNK: I'll think about that in the future, Mrs. Burke.
DEREK : Mrs. Burke? Preston's mother?
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Yes, and you are?
UNK: Derek Shepherd. The surgeon who operated on your son.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Thank you, brilliant surgeon.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : And a handsome man too. Your mother must be very proud.
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Do you mind, Dr. Shepherd, if I borrow
UNK: your intern for a cup of coffee? I'll bring her right back.
DEREK : No problem. Dr. Grey can cover for Cristina.
MEREDITH : - I'm sorry? - Dr. Grey is very busy.
CHRISTINA : She has charts to do for Bailey. Bailey is on the warpath.
UNK: Not the German warpath. It's a hospital warpath.
DEREK : I'll take care of Bailey. Enjoy your coffee date.
UNK: - Very nice meeting you. - Thank you.
UNK: I'II, um...
CHRISTINA : I just have this one quick...
CHRISTINA : I'll meet you in the cafeteria in a couple minutes, all right?
UNK: MRS. BURKE : Yes, I look forward to it.
