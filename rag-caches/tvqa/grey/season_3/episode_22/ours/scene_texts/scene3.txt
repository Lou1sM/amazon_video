Kathy : - You'd do it with me, right? - Hm?
Sam : I think you need to spend some time with our therapist.
Cooper : Hey!
Addison : Hey.
Cooper : Thanks for the ride.
Cooper : Have you been crying?
Violet : - Where's your car? - Were you crying?
UNK: You want to walk?
Cooper : I met a girl at a bar.
Cooper : On the Internet. And she borrowed my car.
Violet : - Did you file a police report? - She might bring the car back.
UNK: - She was hot. - Cooper. Cooper.
Violet : All right. So you meet a strange woman on the internet. Again.
Violet : You bring her back to your apartment to have sex with you again.
Violet : She steals from you. Again. What's that suggest to you? About you?
Cooper : That I'm an optimist.
Cooper : That I believe in magic.
UNK: That there is a soul mate out there waiting for me.
Cooper : Oh, Violet.
UNK: Allan's not worth it. You deserve better.
Violet : I know that. I do.
Violet : I'm not... I'm not crying about him.
Burke : I'm not.
Violet : Don't look at me. Look over there.
