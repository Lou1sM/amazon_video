Addison : - I can refer you to someone local... - No, I want you. You will be there?
Sam : I thought Kathy was coming to the appointment today.
Addison : Oh.
UNK: It's just Kathy didn't come home last night.
Addison : You know what, I don't blame her, but it's just
Paul : what if she's with some guy right now? Some guy...
UNK: ...some guy who can bring it?
Sam : Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's OK.
Sam : All right? There are plenty of medical reasons for low sex drive, all right?
Paul : - Sorry. Sorry. - Honey. Where were you?
Kathy : - I was out. - All night?
UNK: Mm-hm.
Kathy : And I had a chance to cheat, believe me.
UNK: But I passed, OK?
Kathy : I passed up being with someone because I am stuck with you!
Kathy : You're crying?
UNK: OK, let's all just calm down here.
Kathy : I'll be in the waiting room.
UNK: Oh, she's starting to hate me.
UNK: What am I going to do if little Paul can't perform?
UNK: OK. Don't talk about your penis while you hug another man.
Paul : - I'm sorry, man. - That's OK. Let's draw some blood.
UNK: OK. Let's draw some blood.
Mark : - What's in L.A.? - What?
Mark : For Addison.
UNK: Any idea what she might be doing there?
Derek : Naomi and Sam are down there.
Derek : You all right?
Mark : We were gonna try.
UNK: We were going to make a go of it. As a couple.
Mark : She bet me I couldn't go 60 days without having sex.
Derek : Oh. Let me guess, you couldn't do it.
Mark : No, she couldn't.
Mark : She didn't want to be with me.
Mark : I thought she did.
Mark : I thought she might.
Mark : But she didn't.
Mark : And I caught her, you know.
Derek : Sleeping with somebody else?
UNK: God, that must've been so hard for you.
Derek : Not that I can't relate.
Mark : - So I told her I did it. - You told her you did?
Mark : I told her I lost the bet. I told her I slept with someone.
UNK: If she didn't want to be with me, she shouldn't have to feel guilty about it.
UNK: Selfless. That's... out of character.
Cristina : Yeah.
Mark : Anyway...
Mark : ...I was just wondering if you knew what was in L.A.
UNK: OK. Now I am going to the beach.
Naomi : Wait, Addie.
Naomi : Your test results came back in.
UNK: Oh. Good. Because, um, I picked a donor.
UNK: I think I'm going to go with physicist guy.
Naomi : Your FSH level is high.
Naomi : Well, they're high this month. We can do ovarian stimulation.
Naomi : And your antral follicle count is only two.
Addison : - That could be due to stress. - Addison. I'm sorry.
Naomi : I did all the tests.
UNK: There is no fertility potential here.
Violet : OK, uh...
Addison : ...this is good. This is...
Addison : Oh, this is just perfect.
Mark : - Addison... - I have the great guy,
UNK: I don't have the baby because I'm focusing on my career.
Addison : Then I have the other guy, I don't have his baby because he's not the great guy.
Addison : And now I don't have the great guy or the other guy
Addison : and I'm finally ready to have a baby and I can't.
Addison : That is so...
Addison : ...exactly what my life is.
UNK: - Addie, there are other options. - Yeah, I know about the options.
Naomi : I'm so sorry. I know how much you wanted this.
Allen : It's OK.
Addison : I just, um...
Addison : I just didn't realize I was out of time, that's all.
Naomi : Addie, please stay so we can...
UNK: No, it's OK. I'm fine. Thank you... for telling me.
Addison : Thank you. I will see you at home.
Voice : Looks like you had a bad day.
Burke : OK.
Woman : Enough.
UNK: OK? Not today. This is not a good day. All right?
Addison : So why don't you just shut up?
Addison : Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Addison : All right then.
