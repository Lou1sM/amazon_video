Allen : Violet?
UNK: - Allan. Great to see you. - Hey!
Allen : - How you doing? - Great. I'm really wonderful.

MVO : - Hi. - Hi.
Allen : - This is Violet. - Violet. Oh! Violet.
UNK: Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Cami.

Addison : Oh.
Violet : Congratulations.

UNK: Hey, Addison, a latte? Or more of a cappuccino.
Addison : Lisa's baby has something called placenta accreta.
Violet : Is that bad?
Addison : The placenta abnormally attaches to the uterine wall.
Addison : It makes delivering dangerous for both mom and baby.
MVO : - Something else. - That's not enough?
Addison : The baby has some genetic markers that don't match Carol, just Lisa.
Naomi : What? The embryo...
Addison : - Did not implant. - This is Lisa's baby?
Addison : Which also means that the paternity is once again up for grabs.
Addison : Good luck. I'm off to the beach.
Cooper : You can't leave. Someone has to tell the patient.
Cooper : Honestly, I have...
Cooper : ...low people skills with anybody over 12.

UNK: She just... She borrowed my car.
UNK: Mm-hm.
UNK: - She borrowed it. Borrowed! - OK.

Cooper : 911 Turbo with hand-sewn leather seats.

Cooper : But she was so hot.
Pete : - Crazy hot chick. - I loved that car.
Sam : - That was a single man's car. - That's the point.
Cooper : I thought maybe I was done being single.
UNK: I thought she would be the mother of my children.
Sam : What was her name again?
Cooper : SexyBoobs316.
UNK: Are you...? Dude, are you crying?
