Izzie : I switched my hours at the clinic so I can go to the bridal shop.
UNK: - She cheered. - Someone's not being very bride-y.
Cristina : I am not a bride. I am a surgeon.
Meredith : Don't tease the caged animal.
Izzie : You're not excited?
Izzie : I'm excited. I love weddings.
Izzie : Weddings are all about hope and the future and...
Callie : OK, I rescheduled an ACL repair, but I want to be clear.
UNK: I will not wear pink or baby blue, I do not do flowers in my hair
Callie : and I will never be seen with a bow on my ass, OK?
Cristina : The right attitude.
Cristina : Thank you very much.
Addison : - Hey. - Hey!
UNK: Hi. I'm here with Susan. She's down in the clinic.
Meredith : Is everything OK?
Izzie : Callie's a bridesmaid?
UNK: Yeah. Yes! Of course. Callie's a bridesmaid! Fun.
Cristina : Yeah.
UNK: Do it. That kid ofyours is going to need you on your feet.
UNK: Jane Doe : She's cute, huh? She's a cute, shriveled kid.
Alex : She's cute. Come on. Let's keep walking.
UNK: So. Where is she, Red? I thought that was on.
Naomi : - Walk. - Gossip.
Alex : You called it.
Alex : She was too serious about the whole thing.
UNK: Jane Doe : And Alex is a rolling stone.
Alex : I was being thoughtful.
UNK: Right. Dumping Red after one night is sensitive?
UNK: Come on. You need to buff up.
UNK: Jane Doe : Did she just take off? What did you say to her?
UNK: Jane Doe : Did she cry?
MVO : - Ow. - Idiot. You divorced Naomi?
Sam : Look, just mind your own business.
Sam : - Ouch. - Moron. She is my best friend!
Sam : Stop hitting me on top of my head.
Addison : Did you cheat?
Sam : OK. Two things I learned way back in kindergarten.
Sam : One, keep your hands to yourself.
Sam : Two, he who smelt it, dealt it.
Addison : - That makes no sense. - Yeah, well...
Sam : You cheated. You cheated on your husband with his best friend.
UNK: There, smelt it, dealt it. It works.
UNK: You're using fart logic!
Sam : - If you want details, go see Naomi. - She won't talk about it.
Sam : - Then you get no details. - I'm on her side.
Sam : - That's why you get no details. - Details.
Sam : Woman, be quiet.
Addison : - I've missed you. - Yeah.
Sam : Well, you know, Naomi's known you longer, so...
Sam : ...she gets custody of you in the divorce.
UNK: So, other than Project Baby,
Addison : this is strictly a vacation.
Addison : I am here to read trashy novels and go to the beach.
Naomi : OK, nobody over 30 goes to the beach.
UNK: You should stay at the practice. Hang out. See how we work.
Naomi : It's more fun than a stuffy hospital.
Naomi : And we have an empty office.
Addison : Are you trying to lure me?
Naomi : Look, maybe. We do have sunshine and cute boys.
Addison : Speaking of which. Cute boy behind the desk is tracking you with his eyes.
Naomi : No, he's not.
Addison : Oh, cute boy wants Naomi.
UNK: OK, maybe you should shut up and go get some coffee or something, please.
Naomi : - You have to stop. - Stop what?
UNK: You can not watch me like that.
Naomi : - I won't allow it. - You can't make rules about my eyes.
Woman : - Enough! - No!
Naomi : Did you hear that?
