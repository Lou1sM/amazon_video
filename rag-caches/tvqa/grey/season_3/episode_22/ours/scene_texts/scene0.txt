Richard : That'd be great.
UNK: - Has anybody seen Addison? - Oh, she's gone.
Mark : - Gone? - She took a leave of absence.
Mark : Why? I mean, did she tell you why?
UNK: - What'd you do? - She didn't give a reason.

Addison : You know? Just get on.
UNK: Ride. Without the sex.
Addison : Right?
Addison : Oh, my God.
