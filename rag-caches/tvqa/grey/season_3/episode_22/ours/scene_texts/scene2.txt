UNK: So you two still work together?
Naomi : Hey, Pete.
UNK: Who is that redhead with your ex-wife?
Pete : She's hot. Possibly insane, but hot.
Sam : Don't even think about it.
Addison : You work with your ex-husband in a shrine for your ex-husband.
Naomi : It's actually a good book, and we're friends.
Naomi : We stayed friends, even after we got divorced.
Naomi : It's very healthy, we're healthy.
Addison : What happened between you and Sam?
Naomi : You and I were close in med school. It was a long time ago.
Addison : Oh, Naomi. Come on.
Addison : You can't stay mad at me forever. I know you.
Naomi : - You got fat. - I did not.
Naomi : - Your hair looks hideous. - It does not!
UNK: - And you're getting really ugly. - Oh. I have missed you too.
UNK: So, why you really here?
Addison : You're a fertility specialist. One of the best.
UNK: - You want to have a baby. - I want to have a baby.
UNK: Susan Grey? You sure you're in the right place?
Susan : I have reflux. Acid reflux.
UNK: And the hiccups come and go
Susan : when it gets really bad.
UNK: They've stopped a few times, but lately it's been getting... worse.
Bailey : Have you had chlorpromazine?
Bailey : - Here you go. - Thank you.
Susan : Isn't that the crazy person's drug?
Bailey : It's used as an anti-psychotic, but it's also helpful with hiccups.
UNK: Now if we don't stop these soon, you will be a crazy person.
UNK: - Ah! - OK.
Susan : Hey, how is Meredith doing?
Susan : I know they have that big intern exam coming up
Susan : and she's been really busy. I tried to call, but...
UNK: Hey! No hiccups.
Bailey : Chlorpromazine.
UNK: I'm not getting any younger. I always planned to have one.
UNK: Now clearly a man is not in the cards for me.
Addison : I mean, this is Addison, post-McDreamy, post-McSteamy.
Addison : I just have to...
UNK: - Mc-what? - Forget it.
Violet : You know what? Let's never Mc-anything.
Addison : A baby. That is... my answer.
Addison : Find a sperm donor, have a baby.
UNK: My new dream. A baby.
Naomi : A baby's not really an answer. It's more of a crying, puking, non-answer.
Addison : - But you did it. - With a husband.
Addison : Yeah, but you did it. You got married, you had a baby.
Addison : You're my example.
Naomi : OK, we should check your FSH and your estradiol levels
Naomi : and we should probably do an antral follicle count.
UNK: Holy crap. I'm going to have a baby.
Sam : - Treadmill, huh? - Hm.
Sam : OK. What's going on?
UNK: I tried to take it up to ten and do the hilly terrain mode
UNK: which you can do if you're an Olympian. I paused and went flying off.
UNK: No, what's going on with you pushing yourself this hard?
Sam : This is your fourth sports injury in three months.
Kathy : I am a sexual person.
Kathy : I'm a normal sexual person. I like sex.
UNK: I need sex. And he won't do it.
UNK: He won't have sex with me. He just... won't.
UNK: Hope you mean your husband. Not hoping, 'cause of the no sex part...
UNK: - It's been 18 months. 18 months! - Wow.
Kathy : Do you have any idea what that is like?
UNK: My husband won't do it!
Kathy : - So you know what I do? - You run?
Kathy : I run. I run so I won't sleep with someone else.
Kathy : I run so I have someplace to channel my energies.
Kathy : I run so I won't pick up a tire iron and beat my husband to death! I need sex!
