UNK: It was nice talking with you.
Dell : - Bye. - Bye-bye.
Izzie : Any news about Mercy West?
UNK: There's a spot. A lot of takers, but they said it looks good.
Izzie : - So, after the intern exam... - I'm not an unfaithful guy.
George : I'm not a cheater.
UNK: - Think it'll happen again if you stay? - No. I don't know.
Izzie : - George. - I have to go.
Addison : - Sam? - Yeah?
UNK: So, Paul and Kathy? I gave them an assignment,
UNK: I told them to do it. He didn't rise to the occasion.
Sam : Nothing? No wood.
UNK: Not even a twig. There's got to be something physical going on, right?
Violet : Because the only other option, that he just
UNK: doesn't love her anymore, that's just...
Cooper : Not the only option.
Cooper : Did they meet in the drama department in college?
Sam : - Could be a thyroid thing. Anemia. - Have you checked for extreme ugliness?
UNK: - Not funny. Will you get back to me? - Yes, I will. OK.
Violet : And Cooper, you know what?
UNK: Ugly people have sex, Cooper. Ugly people are people too.
Addison : Hello?
Addison : Hello?
Addison : Hello?
Addison : Hello?
Mark : - You fill out this EEG request on Ava? - Yeah, you asked for it.
Mark : I asked you to run labs on her every other day.
Alex : Shepherd's doing a full neuro workup. Get the hell...
Mark : Go ahead. I would love to have an excuse to lay you out.
Pete : I didn't do anything.
Mark : Whatever you didn't do sent Addison running for the hills.
UNK: OK. This guy is six-two, dark hair, green eyes.
Addison : Totally healthy. He plays the violin and he's a physicist.
Addison : That is good sperm.
Addison : Geeky, but, uh, good.
Naomi : Lisa has extra donors if you want to borrow one.
Naomi : Her tests come in yet?
Addison : No, tomorrow. I don't want to ring any alarm bells until we're sure.
UNK: Ooh. What about this guy? He's a marine biologist. Good hair.
Naomi : Are you sure you want to do this?
Naomi : Your life is really gonna change.
Addison : That's why I'm doing this.
Addison : I want my life to change.
UNK: I need my life to change.
UNK: I mean, look, you have Maya. You have a family.
UNK: You did everything the way you're supposed to. You didn't wait.
Naomi : Maybe I should have.
Naomi : - Waited. - What do you mean?
Naomi : Addison, I did everything exactly the way I was supposed to.
Naomi : After college, I never dated anybody but Sam because he was the one.
UNK: I never had sex with anybody but Sam because cheating is wrong.
UNK: I had a baby because that's what you do when you get married.
Naomi : I never made a single mistake. I did everything right.
Naomi : And then Sam comes home and says he wants a divorce.
Naomi : So, all those photos you're busy admiring,
UNK: all they are, are reminders of all the stuff I didn't do.
UNK: I'm 38 years old and I don't know how to have fun. That's not lucky. That's sad.
UNK: So shut up about lucky!
UNK: Poor sad dried up Naomi.
Naomi : Shut up.
Addison : Poor little special,
Addison : talented doctor girl.
Addison : Let's make a made-for-TV movie
UNK: about the poor little dried up special girl who has no fun.
UNK: I could put you out. You'd have to sleep in the car.
Meredith : I just...
UNK: I just wish I'd been a little more like you.
UNK: What, an adulterous bitch who forgot to have kids?
