Naomi : - Did you hear that? - What was that?
Violet : Did I just hear...
UNK: Man 2 : - I'm the father! - No, I'm the father!
Carol : - If it's anybody's baby, it's mine! - Calm down! Hey! Hey, hey!
UNK: Whoa! A little help here! A little help!
UNK: Oh, my God! Cooper!
Carol : - Dr. Freedman! - Ow!
Carol : Oh, that's great. Really great.
UNK: You got to be kidding me.
Meredith : You could've called.
Susan : It's such a silly problem. Hiccups.
Thatcher : We didn't want to bother you.
Meredith : It's not silly if you can't sleep.
Bailey : Chlorpromazine is good, but it doesn't always work long-term.
Bailey : We've had some good result with endoscopic gastroplication.
Meredith : We put a tube down your throat
Meredith : and sew together the bottom of your esophagus
UNK: to protect it from acid in your stomach.
UNK: - An outpatient procedure. - I'm sold. Ready when you are.
UNK: You sure that's not...?
Susan : Just think of it like breathing into a very expensive brown paper bag.
Naomi : OK, let me see if I can explain this to everyone.
Naomi : So, Carol was married to Rick. Carol is now married to Doug.
Naomi : Keith is Lisa's husband.
Keith : - I'm Rick's husband. - Life partner.
Rick : You're just mad I left you for a man.
Jim : - I'm Lisa's husband. - Lisa...
UNK: - The surrogate carrying my child. - Our child.
Jim : You are not the father! You don't know that!
UNK: - I'm so sick of you! - Hey!
UNK: OK, let's all try to remember that we are in a place of healing.
UNK: Lisa, how are you feeling?
Carol : Guilty. Guilty is how she is feeling.
Violet : Why is that, Lisa?
Carol : Because the same week that I brought her here to be inseminated,
UNK: she had sex with him.
UNK: And him. And him.
Carol : And we have no idea who the father is.
UNK: Yeah, she... really gets around.
Pete : How do you pick a super freak for a surrogate?
Violet : I screened her. There was nothing to indicate she was...
UNK: Sex-crazed? Insatiable?
Violet : Cooper-like?
Naomi : Everybody's flipping out over nothing. Medically, it has to be Rick's baby.
Naomi : We implanted Lisa with a fertilized embryo
Naomi : from Carol's egg and Rick's sperm.
UNK: Then Rick implanted more of his own for good measure.
Violet : Before he decided he was gay.
Pete : I've treated Doug. I have him on valerian root for anxiety and stress.
Pete : And I knew he was fooling around, but with his new wife's surrogate?
UNK: Can I just...?
Addison : I think the more pressing issue here is that
Addison : Lisa's had no prenatal care.
Addison : She took off right after her...
Cooper : Sex-a-thon?
UNK: Hi, we haven't met. Cooper. Pediatrics.
UNK: Hi. Yeah, she left town and she and the baby need a complete workup.
Addison : Who's your usual GYN?
Sam : She left the practice rather suddenly.
Pete : I didn't do anything.
