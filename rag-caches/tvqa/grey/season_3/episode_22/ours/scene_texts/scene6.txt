Addison : Well, look, I would be happy to examine her. Trashy novels can wait.
Cooper : You ever thought...
Cooper : ...of plying your trade in sunnier climes, Addison?
UNK: Sunnier climes? Now we see why he has to type to pick up women.
Cooper : Hey!
Sam : Besides, we have a very strict "no consorting" rule here now.
UNK: I didn't do anything!
George : I can't wait to tell Meredith her step-mom hiccupped through it.
George : - She should be here for this. - Susan asked her to be with her father.
Bailey : She said he's having a lot of anxiety.
UNK: And Meredith is supposed to help with that?
Meredith : You know, there's nothing to worry about.
Derek : What I...
Thatcher : What I worry about is Molly, living in a new city,
Thatcher : alone with a baby most of the day, that's hard.
Thatcher : And Lexie, who's... about to start her residency.
UNK: She's a good student, but it's grueling.
Addison : I know.
Addison : Right.
Thatcher : I worry about you...
Thatcher : ...too, how you're getting on, your mom, none of that was simple.
Meredith : Susan's really on you to talk to me, huh?
Thatcher : I got to admit. I'm envious.
Thatcher : That she's getting to know you...
Thatcher : ...and I'm not. Yet.
Thatcher : I think she may be faking these hiccups.
UNK: To get us in the same place?
Paul : I guess I'm just not very sexual.
Kathy : He's having an affair. He's not in love with me.
UNK: That's not true, honey! I love you. I love you so much.
UNK: I want to do it!
Paul : I just want to want to do it.
Violet : OK, Paul, I'm gonna give you some homework for next session.
Paul : - Homework? - Have sex with your wife.
Izzie : - Yay! - Whoa...
Violet : No matter what. Whether you're in the mood or not. Have sex.
UNK: In the bed, on the kitchen floor. Do you have a pool?
Richard : - Yes. - Do it in the pool.
UNK: Have sex. No pressure, no judgment, no expectations.
UNK: Have sex. Just... do it.
Pete : We do need a new GYN.
Addison : - Right. - And Addison seems...
UNK: Oh. Nuh-uh. No. Absolutely not.
Naomi : - What? - Addison is a nice person.
Sam : She is a decent person. She is a person.
UNK: - I'm looking for a person. - Man, you're just looking.
Pete : At least I'm trying.
UNK: Doctor Feelgood!
Addison : - Hey. - I love you.
Sam : Hi. Thank you.
UNK: OK, Doctor Feelgood. This is what I'm saying.
Pete : Your career is taking off,
UNK: girls like that throw themselves at you. You should be celebrating.
Sam : Celebrating? I just got a divorce.
UNK: You got a tiny little dog and you cook it chicken and you talk to it.
Pete : - That's not normal. - Hey, easy, all right?
Sam : I'm alone because I choose to be. It's a choice.
Pete : You're saying that you're not interested in Addison but I can't have her?
Sam : Addison isn't the type of woman you have. She's a marriage woman.
UNK: She'll want a commitment and you...
Pete : I do not sleep around.
UNK: No. You are a serial monogamist.
UNK: You date a girl, romance a girl. When it's time to commit, you cut and run.
Callie : - I do not. - Linda, Karen, Julie.
Sam : Then there was Tricia, Amy, Carrie, the other Linda...
Pete : - Fine. I won't ask her out. - Good boy.
Sam : That's a good boy.
UNK: In the week before I implanted the embryo, you slept with how many? Three?
Naomi : Three men.
Addison : We're almost done here. Then we'll do the amniocentesis.
Lisa : - You're on Carol's side. - I'm Carol's doctor.
Naomi : You applied to be a surrogate.
Naomi : - It was your choice. - I know. I just...
Lisa : I was about to hand my body over to a baby that's not mine for nine months.
Lisa : Which is a big responsibility. That hit me.
UNK: The responsibility. And I just...
Lisa : They all wanted me. Me.
UNK: And, for once, I just stopped thinking and I just...
Lisa : I did something wild.
UNK: Doctor Montgomery, is something wrong?
UNK: I'm going to run some more tests.
Meredith : You promise me you'll take it easy.
Susan : I have a stack of DVDs to watch and I expect your father to feed me by hand.
Meredith : Just call if you have any questions.
