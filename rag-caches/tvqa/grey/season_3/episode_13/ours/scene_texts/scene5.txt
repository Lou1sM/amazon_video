Meredith : Hey.
UNK: When Richard invited you out here, what did he use as bait?
Addison : He told me I would have the foremost neonatal unit west of Manhattan.
Derek : He didn't say anything about being chief?
UNK: - Why? What do you know? - Nothing.
Derek : - I know what you know. - You're lying.
Izzie : - Dr. Montgomery. - Busy now, Karev.
Alex : When you get a minute, I'd like to talk about the kissing.
Cristina : - Who'd you piss off? - Sloan.
Izzie : - Nice. - You got anything good?
Cristina : Not even a fracture.
UNK: You'd think a guy passes out while running would get a fracture.
Burke : Anyone available to assist me on a truncus arteriosus surgery?
Callie : - Yeah. - Yes, absolutely.
Callie : Good.
Burke : The first one of you to accurately describe the condition will scrub in.
UNK: No one knows the answer?
Burke : That's too bad. It'll probably be years before we see another one like this.
Burke : Oh, well.
Cristina : It's a single arterial trunk coming from the ventricles.
Cristina : - How could you not know that? - How could you not say it?
UNK: She tried, but she couldn't crawl out from underneath
UNK: that very large pile of pride.
Burke : I'm sorry you had to find out about the chief that way.
Derek : You mean, after the fact? Not the first time.
Burke : I couldn't go to anybody about my hand. I didn't know who I could trust.
Burke : - I was stuck. - Yeah. Well, now you're not.
UNK: Hand's all better. You can operate. You can even run for chief.
UNK: - Life is all good again. - No. I'm not going to try for chief.
UNK: I'm looking for... answers.
Derek : Chief asked you once already. Don't see why he wouldn't again.
Burke : Look, I couldn't take the job. It wouldn't be...
Burke : It wouldn't be... right.
UNK: Well, whether something's right or not
UNK: doesn't seem to matter much in this place.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: They keep taking my blood. I thought I'd be able to leave soon.
UNK: Your labs show that you're dehydrated, your muscles are breaking down a bit.
UNK: We just want everything back to normal
Cristina : - before we send you home. - My knee's going to be OK, right?
Steve : I blew this race. I gotta win the next one.
UNK: - You've won marathons before? - Twice.
UNK: Well, most people are just happy surviving the 26 miles.
UNK: I'm not most people.
UNK: Yeah, me neither.
UNK: Uh, your X-ray looks fine.
UNK: Your knee should be OK in three weeks. You might try some PT.
UNK: - It's pretty sore. - The knee?
Steve : Yeah. My calves, too.
UNK: Oh, well, maybe your brace is a little too tight.
UNK: You got extreme swelling in both legs. Get Torres now.
UNK: - What happened? - He was complaining of leg pain.
UNK: - Can't you make it stop? - Can't find a pulse.
UNK: - Didn't page me? - Just happened. Ordered morphine.
