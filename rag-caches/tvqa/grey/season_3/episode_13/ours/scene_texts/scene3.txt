Cristina : Right.
UNK: - and be repositioned every two hours. - Every two hours?
Meredith : By the time we finish we'll have to start again.
Mark : - I'm crying on the inside. - Can't the nurses help?
Mark : They could, but I like nurses.
Mark : They're helpful and smart and already good at their jobs.
Mark : So as a going away gift to them, I'm going to let you hang with Jim
Mark : while I go do one last rhinoplasty at Seattle Grace.
UNK: I like to leave a city just a little prettier than when I came.
Alex : Did he just say he was leaving? As in quitting?
Bailey : Dr. Shepherd.
Derek : Dr. Bailey. How was your meeting with the chief?
UNK: That's what I want to talk to you about,
Bailey : a project I'm trying to get off the ground.
Bailey : I'd like to open a free clinic.
Derek : - Why? - Because I want to.
Bailey : And I could use your support.
UNK: That kind of project is logistical, strategic and administrative.
Derek : Something the chief does. Apparently I'm not cut out for that kind of work.
Derek : So, you're going to have to take it to somebody else.
Callie : - How's George? - Dealing, I guess.
Callie : He sure has a voracious appetite.
UNK: Well, some people bake, others eat.
UNK: No, I don't mean that appetite. The other appetite.
UNK: Oh, OK.
UNK: We are not friends, you and I.
Cristina : We're not friends. Don't talk to me about what George eats.
UNK: OK, I thought you'd be concerned.
Callie : But you know what? Forget it. I don't like you.
UNK: Oh, now my feelings are hurt
UNK: because you won't share inappropriate details about your sex life.
UNK: Steve Beck, age 32.
Cristina : Right patellar dislocation while running a marathon.
Steve : Paramedics told me I blacked out.
Callie : Any theories as to how Mr. Beck passed out?
Cristina : No sign of head injury. His BP was low in the field, 80/60.
UNK: Athletes have low BP's.
Cristina : In that case it's probably dehydration.
UNK: - I drank a lot along the way. - What else did you do today?
Steve : Ate a couple of protein bars, took a couple of aspirin for this cold.
Steve : I got another race next month. Oh! God!
Callie : Put him in a patellar brace, get post-reduction films, and run labs.
UNK: Make sure he's not dehydrated. And, Steve,
Callie : next time you have a cold, you might want to skip the race.
Izzie : Never.

George : - Callie! Hey. - Hi. Sorry. Busy. Izzie.
UNK: - Is she avoiding me? What are...? - Maybe. I don't know.
UNK: I'm here if you wanna talk. You're sad.
UNK: I don't wanna talk about that.
UNK: - I'm your best friend. - Why are you making this about you?
UNK: It's not. It's about me wanting to talk about you needing so much sex
UNK: - your girlfriend's vagina's broken. - Puritans.
Izzie : - I'm not a Puritan. - Izzie.
UNK: - Look out! - Coming through!
