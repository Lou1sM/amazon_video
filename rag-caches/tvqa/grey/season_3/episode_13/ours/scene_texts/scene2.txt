Richard : You have the length of this elevator ride. Use it well.
Bailey : I have two words for you, chief. Free clinic.
Derek : - What? - I want Seattle Grace to open a clinic.
Bailey : - I know, it's a big undertaking. - This isn't even surgical.
UNK: Chief, I can do this. I know I can.
Bailey : - I've done all the research. - There's hoops to jump through.
Richard : Funding, you have to get department heads to OK it...
Bailey : Well, if I get the support, will you consider this?
Richard : I'll think about it. I can't imagine why you want to take this on.
Richard : You're a surgeon. I gotta get to my meeting now.
UNK: - You've been having pain and bleeding? - For weeks.
Jillian : - It's not a big deal. - I had to drag her in here.
UNK: - On our day off from the restaurant. - Let the doctors check you out.
Rachel : A lot of doctors. She needs three people for a Pap smear?
Addison : Actually, it's not a Pap smear, it's a pelvic exam.
Addison : And since this is a teaching hospital,
Addison : I was going to have one of the interns do the exam.
Addison : - If you're uncomfortable with that... - No, it's fine.
Jillian : I'm helping you guys learn something, right?
UNK: - OK. Stevens? - Really? Bailey said...
Jillian : It's OK.
MVO : OK.
UNK: Jilly, I'm just going to warm the speculum for comfort,
Izzie : so if you'll just relax your knees.
Jillian : You don't have to stay.
Rachel : I'm staying. We do everything together.
UNK: We might as well do this.
Jillian : Rachel and I were born two days apart.
UNK: That's nice your friendship has stayed so strong.
Rachel : Cradle to grave, right?
Rachel : Cradle to grave.
Izzie : Just relax this muscle for me. You're going to feel the speculum.
UNK: Dr. Montgomery?
UNK: If you're having a difficult time finding the cervix
UNK: - point the speculum downwards. - Dr. Montgomery.
UNK: - OK, Jilly... - Wait.
Jillian : - He didn't get to look. - I don't have to.
UNK: You said this was a teaching hospital. He should learn.
Addison : Dr. O'Malley.
Rachel : OK, what do you have up there?
Rachel : Is she pregnant? My God, if you are pregnant...
Jillian : No. I'm not pregnant.
Jillian : Am I?
MVO : No.
George : I could see the tumor with my naked eye.
Izzie : I've never seen a cervical tumor that large.
Rachel : Does she have cancer?
Izzie : It'll take hours to get the biopsy results back.
UNK: If she has cancer I need you to tell me because if you tell me in front of her,
UNK: I'll start to cry and when I cry, she cries.
George : If she has family, parents, you should call them.
George : You should call them now.
UNK: It's just her parents... We left home.
Rachel : We both left home when we were 16 and we haven't been back.
Rachel : We don't speak to them. It's complicated.
UNK: It's just Jilly... In situations like these,
Izzie : she might change her mind. She might want her family.
Rachel : I am her family.
Rachel : She is my family.
Rachel : I am not contacting her parents. And neither are you.
