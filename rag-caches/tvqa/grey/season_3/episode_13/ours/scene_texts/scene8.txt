UNK: He felt dizzy miles before he passed out.
Callie : He should have stopped, sat his ass down.
UNK: He was in it to win. I can understand that.
Richard : You can, can you?
UNK: Surgery's the most competitive field in medicine.
Richard : It's a long road. When you get to the end,
UNK: you're not gonna care about winning.
Richard : You're just going to be relieved that you made it to the finish line.
Derek : - You told Sloan? - What?
UNK: You told him chief was stepping down? I wanted the job?
Meredith : - I didn't know that was a secret. - He was leaving town!

Derek : You gave him a reason to stay.
Meredith : Derek.
UNK: I just got back to work, Bailey. I've got a lot to catch up on.
UNK: I'm asking for a few hours a week.
UNK: I can't deal with any more distractions right now.
Bailey : You owe me.
Derek : - What? - When you had that tremor,
Bailey : you cut me out of surgery after surgery.
UNK: You made me feel like I was the one who couldn't do her job.
UNK: You made me doubt myself. You owe me this.
Burke : You need someone who can provide leadership to the project.

UNK: Because I want to be ready. I want to know everything so I can do this.
Rachel : - Do this right for her. - Rachel...
Izzie : ...you can't be everything. It's too hard.
Izzie : Jilly has parents who love her. They love her
Izzie : and they're here and she wants to go home.
Rachel : - No, she doesn't. - She called them. Not me.
UNK: Jilly?
Izzie : Jilly is dying.
Rachel : But I promised her.
Rachel : Cradle to grave.

Addison : - Yes, Derek. Both of us. - You're unbelievable.
