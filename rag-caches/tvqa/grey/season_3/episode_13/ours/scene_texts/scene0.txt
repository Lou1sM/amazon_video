UNK: The chicken's delicious. What is it?
UNK: - It's salt crusted. - It's his mama's recipe.
UNK: - Meredith? Would you like seconds? - No, I'm great.
UNK: This is great, but maybe Cristina would like some.
Meredith : - Cristina, would you like some? - I only made enough for three.
UNK: This isn't at all awkward.
UNK: You know, we can go and you two can talk.
Cristina : - We're talking. - To each other.
Meredith : Enjoying your meal at the International House of Silence?
Meredith : Burke, you have to feed Cristina.
Meredith : She doesn't cook and she will starve.
UNK: - I have cereal. - You two live together.
Meredith : Someone has to be the first to speak. This is insane.
Burke : I am giving a dinner party.
Burke : If she wants to sit there, she can.
UNK: Let's enjoy our evening and talk about something else.
Derek : I heard a crazy rumor today from one of the scrub nurses.
Derek : - That Richard was retiring. - That's an interesting rumor.
Derek : What? It's true?
Derek : Richard's going to name a new chief of surgery?
Cristina : He asked Burke. But Burke took himself out of the running
Cristina : which apparently is my fault. For being part of the team.
Derek : - He asked you? - Who wants dessert?
UNK: Burke as Chief.
UNK: Did you see how miserable they were?
UNK: Richard promised me chief.
Meredith : It's so sad. She's not talking to him, he's not talking to her.
UNK: He asked me to come out here.
UNK: Said I would become chief.
UNK: But no, no, no, no.
Derek : - He asks Burke. - I don't think they're gonna make it.
UNK: He said to me, "Shep, you're my man. "' Not Burke.
Meredith : How can two people be in a relationship and not talk?
Derek : I am supposed to be chief.
UNK: George? Can I come in?
UNK: I made you cookies, brownies, muffins. I always make muffins.
UNK: I can't take it anymore. Three times already tonight.
UNK: And he's getting ready for a fourth!
UNK: Are you talking about...? Oh.
UNK: Yeah. You know, I'd get it if he were crying or depressed.
UNK: We deal differently. This is not grieving.
Callie : This is my legs being bent in ways they don't go.
Callie : I know his dad died. I get it. I feel horrible for him.
UNK: But if this keeps up, pretty soon we'll be having a funeral for my vagina.
UNK: I'll give you guys some privacy. Very far away.
UNK: No! You stay. You take over for me, OK?
Izzie : - Callie Torres! - No, not like that.
UNK: I am giving him to you. You are now officially on George-Watch 2007.
UNK: You are his friend. And I need a break. I need to heal.
UNK: - No! - I need to heal!
UNK: What am I supposed to?
George : Callie!
Callie : - Thank you. Goodbye. - No! Callie!
UNK: What's taking you so...?
UNK: Uh, she... she had to go.
