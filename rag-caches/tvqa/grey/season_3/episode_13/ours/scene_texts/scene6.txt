UNK: He's gonna need it. His legs are rock hard and he's pulseless.
UNK: - His compartment pressures's 76. - Open a cut-down tray.
UNK: Gloves. I need you to do everything I do, exactly as I do it.
UNK: All right? Steve?
Callie : This is going to hurt, but if you want to keep your legs,
Callie : I need you to hold them still. Can you do that?
UNK: OK. Hold his legs.
Callie : All right.
UNK: OK. Follow my lead.
UNK: People, what happened?
UNK: Came in with a dislocated patella, dehydration.
UNK: Quick-onset compartment syndrome in bilateral legs.
UNK: CK is through the roof. His potassium is 7.6.
UNK: He looks like he's had a recent Ml.
UNK: I've started pushing meds for hypokalemia, no response.
Richard : His kidneys are failing. Why in the hell is this progressing so rapidly?
UNK: - Oh, damn it! - What?
UNK: Aspirin. With dehydration, his muscles are breaking down.
UNK: Aspirin is accelerating it. His system's crashing.
UNK: The toxins are going to kill him. I need to put in a dialysis catheter.
UNK: Let's get this man to an OR now, people.
UNK: Want to go grab lunch?
UNK: Oh, yeah, I was actually hoping to grab lunch with Callie.
George : - Have you seen her? - No, but...
George : - I think I'm going to page her. - George.
Callie : - Izzie. - Look.
Izzie : - They're still here. - They're her family.
George : Where else are they going to go?
George : Actually I'm going to find Callie.
UNK: Dr. Leone, call the blood bank. Dr. Leone, call the blood bank.
Izzie : - Dr. Montgomery. - Now is not a good time... Karev!
UNK: - Karev, listen to me. - No, you listen.
UNK: You kissed me, right? And ever since you've been avoiding me.
Meredith : - Alex. - You've been avoiding me
UNK: because you assume I want you.
UNK: You expect that everyone you look at sideways is pining after you?
Alex : Has it even occurred to you that maybe I'm not interested?
Addison : You're not interested?
UNK: Do you think I want to be just another intern sleeping with an attending?
Addison : You kissed me back.
Alex : You're my boss. I mean, what did you expect me to do?
Alex : Look, Sloan's had me changing bandages all day.
UNK: I would rather be scrubbing in on your surgeries.
Alex : If you keep avoiding me, then I don't get to scrub in.
Alex : So stop avoiding me.
Alex : It happened. But it doesn't have to happen again.
Callie : - All right. - All right.
UNK: You're headed back to New York?
Mark : - Where'd you hear that? - Good news travels fast.
Derek : I was going to ask you to scrub in on a nerve reconstruction.
Derek : - Since it's your last day... - It isn't. And I'd love to.
UNK: - What? I thought... - I was going, but now I'm not.
Mark : Rumor has it there's a race for chief.
Mark : - Where'd you hear that? - Good news travels fast.
