UNK: - I think he paged all of us. - That can't be good.
Mark : Sure, it can. He could be letting us know I won the race for chief.
Bailey : He's making his recommendation to the board tomorrow.
Bailey : - Chief of surgery and chief resident. - Why were we paged?
Bailey : Search and Rescue found those lost climbers who were up on Mount Rainier.
Richard : - The climbers are on their way. - Any specifics?
UNK: They found only three. One's missing.
Richard : They're reporting severe dehydration with traumatic head and chest injuries.
Richard : Dr. Bailey, Dr. Torres, you'll be my trauma team.
Bailey : Bad day not to have interns.
George : - What? - Today's the intern exam.
UNK: You have to do your own heavy lifting today.
Richard : If you see an intern, which you will 'cause they can't help themselves,
Richard : turn them away until after the exam.
Richard : Ambulances are five minutes away. It's time to do what we do best.
UNK: "What is a Gerota's fascia?"
Alex : The fascia surrounding the kidney.
UNK: Yep. "'Which is longer, the left or the right renal vein?"
Alex : That's right, the left one. Looks and smarts, not bad.
Alex : You think? She's got my dad's nose, though.
UNK: Girl's got to have a big personality to pull off that nose.
George : What?
Alex : You remember your dad.
UNK: No. I... No.
Alex : You just said...
UNK: I know, but I have no idea where that came from.
Alex : That was a memory.
Alex : It doesn't always come back all at once. It can happen in pieces.
UNK: Jane Doe : - Don't get all... - Dude, your memory's coming back.
UNK: - How you feeling, Preston? You ready? - I'm always ready for surgery.
Derek : - He's talking about the wedding. - Tomorrow's the big day.
Burke : Cristina hasn't written her vows,
Burke : my best man just canceled and it's still raining.
Derek : - He's not ready. - You're never ready.
Richard : I certainly wasn't.
Richard : But then, the minute I saw Adele coming down that aisle...
Richard : Well, have you picked your best man?
George : - Chief... - You can't be his best man.
Richard : Why not?
Derek : A conflict of interest. The man wants to be chief of surgery.
Burke : - Actually, Derek... - Not that that's why you're asking.
Burke : - I was going to ask you. - Ask me what?
Izzie : Oh.
Derek : - Really? - We have been through a lot this year.
UNK: And everybody else turned you down? All right, what do I have to do?
Richard : Traditionally, the best man plans the bachelor party.
Derek : Drinks at Joe's after work?
Burke : Yeah. I knew you were the man for the job.
Paramedic : Dale Winick, 32, BP 90/50, tachy to one-ten,
Paramedic : severe frostbite, but no obvious internal injuries.
Richard : - Got it. My God. - Wow.
Paramedic : Yeah. Those aren't gloves.
Bailey : Let's go.
