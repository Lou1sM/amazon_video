Walter : Car metaphors? No.
UNK: I'd be happy to. Give me a call and we'll set up an appointment.
Joe : That's the thing.
Joe : She lives in Portland, and she's only going to be in Seattle for one day.
Walter : She's kind of here now.
UNK: Now as in...?
MVO : Now.
Izzie : - George, wait. Wait a minute. - Yeah?
Izzie : You don't have to transfer to Mercy West.
George : - Yeah, I do. - No.
Izzie : Forget about you and me for a second. OK, what about Meredith?
Izzie : Alex and Cristina? Who's gonna hold us together if you're not here?
Izzie : You're the glue. You're George.
George : - I can't stay here. I can't... - No one's making you to go.
George : ...stay here and see you every day.
George : And not...
George : - I can't keep kissing you in elevators. - I know. I know that.
George : I'm married. I'm a married man.
Alex : You busy?
UNK: Jane Doe : Cute. What are you doing here? Isn't the exam in...
UNK: Yeah, I just want to run a quick neuro-psych test on you.
UNK: No. No. Go take your test. I have a baby to feed.
UNK: - What is wrong with you? - Nothing.
UNK: You've been wishing you could remember who you were. Now you can.
UNK: Jane Doe : I can't. It was something I said.
Alex : Why are you acting like it's no big deal, like it happens all the time?
UNK: Alex, come on. It... That's not...
Alex : Unless it does happen all the time.
Alex : Tell me the truth. Do you remember?
Alex : Do you know who you are?
UNK: "What is biloma?"
Meredith : Cristina, I really don't have time.
UNK: A biloma is an intraperitoneal bile fluid collection.
Cristina : - Excellent. - I'll be fine.
Izzie : - Meredith. - George, I got to go.
Alex : Your dad.
UNK: Hey. I was just on my way to...
UNK: No. I came here to tell you you're not wanted.
Thatcher : I don't want you at any funeral, Meredith.
UNK: - Why don't you come with...? - She trusted you!
Thatcher : She came to you for help and you killed her.
Thatcher : You did. You killed my wife. You took her from me.
Molly : Dad!
UNK: So, I don't want to see you. I don't want to hear from you.
UNK: And I do not want you anywhere near her funeral!
Thatcher : Do you understand me?
Molly : Dad, Dad. Come on. Lexie's waiting in the car.
Molly : - We have to go, Dad. - She was everything to me. All I had.
Thatcher : She was all I had.
Thatcher : She was all I had.
Alex : I can sit here all day. I'll miss my test, but I will sit here all day.
UNK: I don't... It... It happened a few days ago.
UNK: I just... I just woke up and it was all there again.
Alex : And you didn't tell me.
UNK: Because... Because there's...
UNK: Jane Doe : - There's nothing to tell. - Why don't I believe that?
UNK: Jane Doe : I was a pregnant woman in a lousy marriage
UNK: Jane Doe : to the nicest guy anyone's ever met, end of story.
Alex : Who is he? What does he do? Where did you meet him?
UNK: Jane Doe : College.
UNK: Jane Doe : We got married the year after we graduated.
UNK: He... I wanted to move to New York,
UNK: Jane Doe : and he wanted to live on the side of a mountain and take over his dad's shop.
UNK: Jane Doe : He's a woodworker. He makes beautiful furniture. It's...
UNK: ...quiet and he's quiet and... I was going out of my mind.
Alex : So you just took off?
MVO : I... I needed... I needed...
UNK: Jane Doe : I needed to think and to be around other people.
UNK: So I came to Seattle and I thought I'd see the sights, ride the ferry.
