UNK: - Have you called him? - No.
Richard : - Why not? - I left him, Alex.
Alex : So? He's your husband.
Alex : You should call him. You want me to call him?
Alex : I mean, what's his name? What's your name?
UNK: Jane Doe : I'm not telling you that.
UNK: - Everything's taken care of. - Don't worry about a thing.
UNK: - I've got pencils and bottled water. - Oh, and PowerBars.
Cristina : You know the material. You're gonna get a high score.
Cristina : Not as high as mine, but everything's gonna be fine.
UNK: What are you standing around for?
UNK: Don't we have a test to...?
Alex : What happened?
UNK: You need to head upstairs. Dr. Grey will join you in a minute.
Richard : You're not to blame for Susan Grey's death and you know it.
Richard : And your father knows it too. He's just...
UNK: Well, he's never been the best communicator.
UNK: And he just lost his wife.
Meredith : Stop acting like my surrogate father.
Richard : Meredith, I'm...
UNK: Just because you slept with my mother, that does not make you my father.
Derek : Follow my finger. Up, down. Side to side...
Derek : Good. Let me know if you can feel this, OK?
UNK: Ow. Yeah, I'm not enjoying that.
Derek : Good. That's a good sign.
Jack : It means I'm not paralyzed?
Derek : The MRI will show us the full extent of the injuries.
UNK: But can we ask you what happened up there?
Dale : It was my fault.
Paramedic : - Dale. - It wasn't your fault.
UNK: Sixty ways to get up Mount Rainier, I had to pick Liberty Ridge?
Jack : It wasn't the route, it was the storm.
Jack : On a clear day, you don't think about storms.
Jack : A minute later, the wind's pasting you to the mountain
Jack : and you can't see your hand.
UNK: Is that why you fell? Because of the storm?
Jack : All I know is, I felt the rope tug and I was in mid-air.
Andy : We all were.
Andy : We were tied together. Must have been a hundred foot drop.
Dale : When we came to, Lonnie wasn't moving.
UNK: Lonnie. He's your friend who's still missing?
Burke : He didn't make it back because he was hurt?
Jack : Because he was dead.
Burke : I'm sorry.
Jack : We had to leave him.
Jack : We had to get to the other side of the mountain or we'd be dead too.
Jack : - We had no choice. - You always have a choice.
Dale : You never leave a man behind.
Proctor : Please take your seats, doctors, and put all study materials away.
Cristina : If you don't know the answer, choose B. It's always B.
Proctor : Write your name in the right-hand corner of your answer sheets.
UNK: You may open your test booklets... now.
Joe : We don't have to be here, if you're uncomfortable.
Rina : Oh, no, it's fine, unless you're uncomfortable.
UNK: Actually, I...
Cristina : He's fine.
Addison : So, Rina, how are you feeling? Any problems?
Rina : Just the fact that I'm huge.
UNK: And I have the worst heartburn I've ever had in my life.
Addison : I can prescribe an antacid for that.
UNK: First thing we're going to do is take a look at the baby. This might be cold.
Rina : This baby deserves parents who are going to make it their whole world.
Joe : You know we're gay, right?
Rina : I figured with you both being boys and everything.
Rina : The other couple I'm considering, they're like, you know, 40.
UNK: She's been trying to get pregnant for ten years. It's so sad.
Addison : There's the heartbeat.
Derek : - Wow. - I know.
Rina : There's, like, a person inside of me.
Addison : Actually, there are two people. Twins.
Rina : - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.
Joe : - I think I'm gonna pass out. - Joe.
UNK: Joe. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Come on.
Proctor : Doctors, we are halfway through our allotted time.
