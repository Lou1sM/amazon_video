UNK: That's OK. We've seen it already.
Mark : - True. - I haven't.
Addison : Well, why don't I buy you a drink instead. First round's on me.
Mark : I'll give you a hand with those.
Derek : Cristina write her vows?
Burke : I guess I'll find out tomorrow.
Burke : - How's Meredith doing? - I have no idea.
UNK: It shouldn't be this difficult, should it?
Burke : Probably not.
UNK: Then again, when I see Cristina walking down that aisle tomorrow...
Derek : All be worth it?
Mark : So how was L.A.?
UNK: L.A. was... different.
Addison : Look, Mark...
Addison : Things don't have to be awkward between us.
Addison : We tried.
Addison : We tried and we did our best. Just because we failed as a couple,
Addison : - it doesn't mean... - I know.
Addison : So we're still friends?
Mark : With benefits?
Addison : Don't push it.
Mark : Thanks, Joe.
UNK: So, hey, how'd it go with Rina?
Joe : Oh, well... Walter took her to the bus station.
Joe : I'm pretty sure he was wishing it was me he was dropping off.
Addison : That bad, huh?
UNK: If I can't get even make it through an ultrasound,
UNK: how am I going to handle a kid? Forget about twins.
UNK: You two are going to make great parents. OK? Whenever that happens.
UNK: You ever think about having kids?
Alex : All the time.
Richard : Adele?
Richard : Adele!
Richard : Adele!
Richard : Oh, come on. I know you saw me.
Richard : Now this is just silly. You don't have to hide.
