Dale : Someone tell me, are the other guys OK?
Richard : They're right behind you.
UNK: Get him a tet-toxin, push a gram of cefazolin IV.
UNK: Get warm circulating water to start thawing his hands.
UNK: I'll get someone on it. Callie!
Izzie : We're supposed to be studying.
Cristina : We are studying. "How do you treat frostbite?"
George : Re-warm, avoid early surgery
George : unless there's a deep infection due to autoamputation.
Cristina : See? Studying.
UNK: Mr. Meltzer, I'm going to need you to save your breath, OK?
UNK: - It hurts! - I'm going to give you pain meds.
Burke : You have several broken ribs which are compromising your breathing.
Cristina : - Did you see that? - That was freaky.
Cristina : I think that was a flail chest. I've never seen one before. Come on.
UNK: God, why, oh, why does today have to be test day?
Derek : I know.
UNK: I bet if you talked to the chief he'll let you take the test later.
Cristina : With the funeral and everything.
Meredith : I don't need to take the test later.
Cristina : OK.
UNK: - Can I get a little help? - I can't feel my legs!
UNK: You could have a spinal injury. Stay calm. You're going to make it worse.
Derek : - Where are we going? - Trauma Three.
UNK: Look at me. It'll be all right.
UNK: You OK?
George : Yeah. I got accepted at Mercy West.
Izzie : Wow. That's... Are you gonna go?
UNK: Well, I kind of have to now, right?
Bailey : What are you fools doing here?
Bailey : In a few hours, you people are taking a test
Bailey : that will determine the course of your medical careers.
Bailey : The five interns with the lowest test scores will be cut from the program.
Bailey : Are you studying for this test? No, you're not.
Bailey : Are you helping out in the ER? You are most certainly not.
UNK: Are you getting out of here before I throw you out?
Bailey : I think you are.
UNK: Whoa, Dr. Shepherd?
Derek : - Aren't you supposed to be studying? - I have a quick question.
Alex : Could the craniotomy you performed on Jane Doe have affected her memory?
Derek : Doubtful. I was mostly working in the speech center of her brain.
Alex : I think she remembered something. Can we test her?
UNK: Run another WMSR. Have to wait and see if she remembers anything else.
UNK: - A good sign, though. - Thanks.
Derek : - Nice work, Dr. Montgomery. - Thanks. I was just directing traffic.
Derek : - I was being sarcastic. - Brain surgery's so impressive.
Derek : - It is. - Addison?
UNK: Yes? Joe. Walter. What are you guys doing here? Everything OK?
Addison : Yeah. We came to see you, actually. We need a consult.
UNK: Don't tell me you're pregnant?
Joe : - No, but... - Our birth mom is.
Walter : Potential birth mom. She hasn't actually picked us yet.
Addison : You're adopting?
Joe : We filed an application, but we never thought we'd get picked.
Joe : Bar-owning gays don't get picked very often.
Walter : I guess having a baby is easier than we thought.
Addison : Yes. I guess so.
Joe : So I was hoping you could take a look at her.
UNK: Kick the tires, check underneath the hood.
