Proctor : You only have 60 minutes left to complete the exam.
Izzie : Meredith?
George : Meredith!
George : She didn't write anything on the test.
George : She didn't answer a single question. She just sat there.
UNK: Wait, George. Just... Just give her a second.
Burke : I've got an extensive anterolateral flail chest.
Burke : He'll need surgical stabilization. Dr. Torres, if you are available...
Derek : My guy has bone fragments in his spinal cord.
Derek : Internal fixation. Dr. Torres will scrub with me.
Bailey : We have more than one orthopedic surgeon in this hospital.
Mark : Dr. Torres and I are looking at multiple amputations.
Callie : Guys, I can be there for all of you. We have to... Dr. Burke asked first.
UNK: - I'd like to schedule you. - With all due respect...
UNK: OK, you all want Torres? Fine. Rock, paper, scissors.
Derek : One, two, three.
Bailey : All rocks. Very typical. Ready? And...
Bailey : Rock smashes scissors.
Derek : Best two out of three. Dr. Burke!
George : What?
UNK: I just want to know how it feels.
Mark : To not have to spend the next 24 hours wondering
Mark : if Richard picked you to be chief resident?
Mark : How's it feel to be the chosen one?
Bailey : Feels just fine.
Derek : Hey. How'd it go?
Izzie : Meredith.
UNK: Don't worry. I got it.
Izzie : It's not like she actually flunked. She just didn't write anything.
UNK: It's like she actually flunked.
UNK: One guy, he was on call three nights before his test,
George : he slept through the whole thing, he had to repeat his intern year.
Izzie : She can't repeat her intern year. We have to do something. Cristina.
UNK: What? OK, I don't know.
Cristina : I mean, Meredith and I don't fail things, this is not in my book.
UNK: It's Bailey. We got to go.
UNK: We got to go.
UNK: - We can't leave her here. - Got a better idea?
UNK: It's showtime, people. Yang, you're scrubbing in with Dr. Burke.
Bailey : Karev, you're with Dr. Montgomery. Stevens, find Dr. Sloan.
George : You paged me too.
Callie : - Mercy West. - Callie told you?
Bailey : You're in the best surgical program in the country.
