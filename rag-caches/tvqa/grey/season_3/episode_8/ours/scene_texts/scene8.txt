ALEX : Dude, I still can't believe you went through all this for a chick.
FRANK : - You never did anything crazy for love? - Not like this.
UNK: - Do you have a girlfriend? - No.
UNK: Dr. Stevens? Frank can sense the vibes.
ALEX : - I'm not talking about this with you. - She left you for another guy?
UNK: Ooh. Frank's hit a nerve.
ALEX : It's more complicated than that.
FRANK : Uncomplicate it then, man.
UNK: Grand gestures is what I'm talking about.
UNK: Be like Frank. Figure out what she wants and make it happen.
UNK: She'll forget all about the other guy. Trust Frank. Frank knows.
UNK: - Hey, what we got? - The second MRl report
MEREDITH : shows bleeding in Mia's brain.
DEREK : Oh, damn it.
DEREK : I gotta go in. Try to relieve the pressure.
MEREDITH : - Two surgeries in one day? - Well, she's tough.
DEREK : Right now we don't have any other options.
MEREDITH : Here.
DEREK : Not so bright and shiny.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : I thought the cancer was in my gut. What are we looking at my heart for?
CHRISTINA : Your EKG showed some abnormalities.
UNK: We wanna make sure your heart's healthy enough to support you through surgery.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : You're a smart girl.
BAILEY : Yes.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : George told me you were the best intern I could have on my case.
CHRISTINA : He said that?
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : He said you were the best intern in the hospital.
UNK: Said you keep everyone on their toes, even him.
UNK: Dr. Yang? You should take a look at this.
ELLIS : OK.
UNK: You paged me?
GEORGE : What is Burke doing in there? I did a pre-op echo.
CHRISTINA : His aortic valve is leaking.
CHRISTINA : He won't make it through the surgery unless we replace it.
CHRISTINA : It's just a valve replacement, George. It'll be fine.
GEORGE : Burke will do it.
GEORGE : Burke will do it and you will clear his schedule.
GEORGE : If someone is going to operate on my dad's heart, I want Burke.
UNK: BROTHER 2 : - Yeah. - OK. It's going to be fine.
UNK: Valve replacement. It's Burke.
UNK: If someone's gonna cut your dad's heart apart, you want it to be him.
UNK: BROTHER 1 : What?
GEORGE : - What's wrong with Burke's hand? - Nothing.
UNK: - He's gonna operate on my father. - Burke is fine.
CHRISTINA : - Your dad will be fine. - You're lying.
UNK: He's hiding something. You're helping him.
CHRISTINA : Leave me alone.
MEREDITH : - You wanted to see me, chief? - Um...
CHIEF : It's about your mother.
MEREDITH : Um...
CHIEF : I know your relationship with her is... complicated.
UNK: And I know you know that she and I were...
MEREDITH : Chief, it's OK.
MEREDITH : What really matters is that you make her happy.
MEREDITH : And my father couldn't. And I couldn't, so...
CHIEF : Meredith, I...
UNK: I can't see your mother anymore.
UNK: I need to make...
CHIEF : I need to try to make my marriage work.
CHIEF : And if I'm going to do that,
CHIEF : I have to stop seeing your mother.
MEREDITH : I see.
ELLIS : She...
CHIEF : She's an extraordinary woman.
CHIEF : She worked so hard, she sacrificed so much,
CHIEF : and to see it end like this...
CHIEF : Take good care of her for me.
UNK: - We got it from here. - Yo.
UNK: OK, Frank. Time to take the tube out.
ALEX : - Izzie, put on some gloves. - What's going on?
ADDISON : - What are you doing? - Ready to take out Frank's boob-tube?
IZZIE : The rules? What if Sloan finds out?
