UNK: No! You're singing it wrong!
UNK: I am? I'm singing it wrong? Um...
MIA : I want Anna.
UNK: She's in the waiting room. I'll get her.
UNK: Mrs Hanson : John.
UNK: Let's all sing it together, OK?
MIA : No. I want Anna.
UNK: - So now you pick a car. - OK.
UNK: Mmm, 1968 Mustang GT 390 fastback.
JERRY : That's interesting.
UNK: Wow, that is hot. That is very hot.
MEREDITH : - Car. - Uh-huh.
UNK: Hey, Georgie. How's Dad?
GEORGE : They're not done yet, but he's fine. Can I talk to you?
GEORGE : - Sure. - Hey...
UNK: Excuse me.
ADDISON : - What are you doing? - Talking to your brothers.
GEORGE : - You don't have to do that. - It's OK. I don't mind.
CALLIE : Ronny and Jerry both have a thing for me.
CALLIE : I was going to go with Jerry, until he went all 1957 Bel Air.
UNK: - I was like, "Really?" - Thanks for trying to help my family,
GEORGE : but it's really not necessary.
CALLIE : George. I'm kidding about your brothers, come on.
GEORGE : Callie, I'm serious. I can handle my family on my own.
GEORGE : You broke up with me, remember?
BAILEY : We may have to do a partial nephrectomy.
MEREDITH : - Think you can save Mia's kidney? - If we can control the bleeders.
BAILEY : Cauterize as I go. Thank you.
BAILEY : Poor baby. It's not going to be an easy recovery.
MEREDITH : With parents like that, she didn't have it easy to begin with.
BAILEY : People do the best they can.
MEREDITH : They don't know their kid's blood type. They don't know her favorite song.
UNK: People want high-powered careers. I get that,
MEREDITH : but they should think twice before having kids.
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
UNK: What? That I should be home with my baby instead of here
UNK: with this little girl and a surgical intern who can't cauterize the bleeders?
ALEX : - Dr. Bailey... - If I were you, Dr. Grey,
BAILEY : I would keep my eye on the surgical area and my mouth shut.
BURKE : O'Malley. How's it going with your dad?
UNK: Good. Chief's doing the endoscopy. He's in good hands.
GEORGE : That was an amazing surgery, the way you let Cristina decannulate.
BURKE : - She shows tremendous promise. - She says she didn't do it.
BURKE : Probably didn't want to rub it in. Make anyone jealous.
UNK: We're talking about Cristina.
UNK: - Everything all right with you? - Sure. Just fine.
GEORGE : If anything ever wasn't, you know, you could talk to me, right?
GEORGE : You've been through a lot lately. Getting shot.
UNK: - All that, it can't be easy. - Yeah.
UNK: Has it not been easy?
GEORGE : It's fine. Send my best to your dad.
ELLIS : OK.
DEREK : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: This civil and mature thing? How far does it go?
UNK: - Mmm, meaning what? - Is it pleasantries in the hallway
ADDISON : - or do we actually interact? - That sounds drastic.
ADDISON : I'm worried about Richard. He seems down.
DEREK : He's separated from his wife. It doesn't make a person giddy.
DEREK : Except in my case.
UNK: - He could use somebody to talk to. - So talk to him.
ADDISON : No, I think we both should. So it's clear he has people to turn to.
UNK: - Because he's a little depressed? - I don't think he's spoken to Adele.
ADDISON : He's our friend. He's been there for us.
UNK: When you get divorced, doesn't that mean your wife stops nagging you?
UNK: - If you took the rings off it'd help. - You gonna come with me or not?
UNK: - Fine. Yes. OK. - Thank you. And I will try soap.
ADDISON : - For the rings, I mean. - OK.
