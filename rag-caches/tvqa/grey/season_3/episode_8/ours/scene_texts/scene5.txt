UNK: Oh, yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
UNK: Oh, look at you!
FRANK : Do they still look lopsided? I mean, from the seroma?
ALEX : - Most of the swelling has gone down. - Yeah? Oh, yeah.
UNK: Dr. Stevens, would you take a look at the twins?
FRANK : Frank would like a woman's perspective.
ALEX : - You're just looking. - Nice!
IZZIE : Uh, yep. Looks pretty even to me. Very defined.
IZZIE : The redness should go away in a couple of days.
UNK: Good, good.
FRANK : Frank got them for his girlfriend. She won't see them till they're perfect.
UNK: - She asked you to get pec implants? - Oh, no, no.
UNK: She joined a gym and got a trainer named Lars.
UNK: What kind of a name is that? Lars?
UNK: So you got fake pecs because you're jealous of a guy with a fake name?
UNK: Well, my last girlfriend, Veena, left me for a guy with hair.
UNK: So I got plugs, too late.
UNK: This time around Frank's not taking any chances.
FRANK : Frank sees the signs of discontent, Frank's fighting back.
FRANK : Oh, yeah.
IZZIE : I just don't get the whole fake boob thing. No offense.
FRANK : These are top of the line. They look real, they feel natural.
FRANK : No, really. Feel them. Really.
