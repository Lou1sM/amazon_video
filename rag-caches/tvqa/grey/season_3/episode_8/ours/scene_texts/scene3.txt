BURKE : I'll push it. O'Malley's father deserves the best.
GEORGE : - Thank you, Dr. Burke. - Not a problem.
CHRISTINA : Your dad better get something interesting wrong with him real fast.
UNK: You're a sick, sick, horrible person.
UNK: - Tell me why you put up with this? - He'll crack and let me in on a case.
IZZIE : You sure you want to do plastics that badly?
UNK: There you are. What, did you go all the way to New York for my pastrami?
UNK: Extra spicy, lettuce, light on mayo.
ADDISON : Mark, what are you doing?
UNK: Lunch. Want my pickle?
ADDISON : Seattle Grace is a teaching hospital.
ADDISON : Part of your job is to teach. Your interns aren't your slaves.
MARK : Fine. No pickle for you.
ADDISON : - Did you see that? - Hmm?
UNK: Sloan. He's using his interns to pick up his dry cleaning and lunch.
UNK: I gotta do an endoscopy.
UNK: What is going on with the men in this hospital?
UNK: How you doing, Mr. Jeffries?
UNK: Ah, Frank's doing OK.
FRANK : He'd be doing a lot better if the twins were even.
ALEX : - Twins? - Frank's new pecs.
IZZIE : - Who is Frank? - You're looking at him.
MARK : Frank, these are interns. I'm supposed to be teaching them.
MARK : Apparently, this is a teaching hospital. Karev?
UNK: Yeah. Frank Jeffries is post-op day three from pectoral enhancement surgery.
UNK: There was a complication when a seroma formed.
UNK: MARK yawning : - And what is a seroma? - Build up of blood and fluid.
MEREDITH : - Sorry. - That concludes today's teaching.
UNK: A tube was inserted in his chest to drain the excess fluid.
UNK: Check the tube for output and change his dressings.
UNK: Dr. Stevens, I guess you can... watch.
UNK: - Dr. Stevens is an excellent doctor. - Yeah. That's what I hear.
GEORGE : - You decannulated a heart. - I didn't.
GEORGE : Yes, you did.
UNK: And when Burke and I were fishing, I noticed something weird with his hand.
UNK: Like a spasm.
UNK: I'm sorry. Why are you even saying that? That is not funny.
GEORGE : I didn't say it was funny.
UNK: I said it was weird.
GEORGE : And him letting you decannulate a heart is weird.
CHRISTINA : You should sit with your father. You should worry about him.
UNK: My father is fine. He's going...
UNK: I have a good...
GEORGE : Don't... This is Burke.
UNK: Do you think that...?
MIA : I want Anna.
UNK: OK, Mia. Mommy and Daddy are here.
UNK: We are just going to take some pictures, OK?
MEREDITH : This is a big camera.
MIA : I don't like it.
BAILEY : Grey, keep her still.
UNK: Mia, baby, it's OK, Mommy's here.
MIA : Where's Anna?
UNK: You need to lie very still, OK?
MIA : I want Anna.
UNK: How about I sing you the good night song?
UNK: MRS. HANSON : And you pretend it's bedtime and stay super still, OK? OK.
UNK: Good night, Mia
UNK: Good night, Mommy
UNK: Good night, Daddy...
