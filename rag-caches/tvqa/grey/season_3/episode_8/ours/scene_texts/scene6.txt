UNK: Come on. Feel them.
IZZIE : Ooh.
IZZIE : - Very solid. - And real.
IZZIE : - I don't know about that. - Well, compare them to his.
ALEX : - I'm not involved. - Come on.
IZZIE : Don't be such a baby.
UNK: This? This is why I don't work with interns.
UNK: Ms. Hanson?
UNK: - Is she all right? - We were able to stop the bleeding.
UNK: Dr. Shepherd has ordered an MRl of her skull fracture.
BAILEY : Hopefully she won't need any more surgery.
UNK: MRS. HANSON : - Thank God. - She's in recovery.
BAILEY : - Dr. Grey will take you up to her. - Thank you.
UNK: Can we wait a minute?
UNK: My husband went down to use a landline. His battery died.
GEORGE : - Sure. - So, Mia, she's OK?
UNK: Oh, she is. Yeah.
UNK: She keeps asking for Anna.
UNK: MRS. HANSON : We fired Anna.
ELLIS : Oh.
UNK: She just seems very attached to her.
UNK: MRS. HANSON : That's my fault, according to my husband,
UNK: MRS. HANSON : because I'm a working mother.
UNK: He's a working dad, but apparently, that's not the issue.
UNK: MRS. HANSON : I love my job. I love Mia more.
UNK: She's my baby. She's my...
UNK: MRS. HANSON : I love my daughter and I love my job.
UNK: MRS. HANSON : I'm not good at the mom stuff, but I'm good at my job.
UNK: Why have a kid if you're only gonna see it on weekends and holidays?
UNK: - You might as well just get a cat. - I talked to Burke, I think he's fine.
CHRISTINA : - You did what? - What's wrong with Burke?
UNK: Nothing's wrong with anybody.
GEORGE : He let her decannulate a heart.
GEORGE : You decannulated a heart this morning? By yourself?
MEREDITH : - Bitch. - No, not by myself.
GEORGE : - Now she's lying. - Yang decannulated a heart.
ALEX : - Why is Alex not surprised? - Izzie isn't either.
UNK: Last week Izzie dug through crap. This week she's fondling manboobs.
IZZIE : - No decannulating hearts for Izzie. - Why aren't you bragging about it?
UNK: - I didn't decannulate the heart. - Izzie and Alex do not believe you.
MEREDITH : What are you two doing?
UNK: Izzie and Alex's patient speaks about himself in the third person.
ALEX : Thought it was annoying, now they like it.
MEREDITH : - Good. Is it going to stop soon? - Wow, what happened?
UNK: You were bright and shiny, asking to be kicked in the face.
MEREDITH : I am. I'm bright. I'm shiny.
UNK: BROTHER 2 : Yeah.
UNK: Izzie thinks this "bright" thing is getting old.
ALEX : Alex agrees.
DEREK : - We think you're depressed. - Both of you?
BAILEY : - Yes. - Yes.
CHIEF : For the two of you to agree on something, I must be suicidal.
ADDISON : - We agree on things. - We agree on this.
ADDISON : So, start talking.
CHIEF : Adele and I...
CHIEF : She wants me to step down as chief. Retire.
UNK: You retire? That's crazy. What would you do?
UNK: - Spend more time with his wife perhaps? - She's unreasonable.
ADDISON : - Marriage is a priority. - She's using work as an excuse.
ADDISON : Or he is. Some men use work. Some men use other women.
DEREK : - Some women use other men. - I've been visiting Ellis Grey.
ADDISON : - I was lonely and you had checked out. - I work, I visit Ellis, that's my day.
DEREK : - You gave up on us first. - I make time for Ellis, not for Adele.
