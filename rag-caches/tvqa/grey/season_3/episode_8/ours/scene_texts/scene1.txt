UNK: OK, then. We'll peacefully coexist.
ADDISON : - Interesting. - We're adults. We're educated.
UNK: We're capable of many things. Let's shake on it.
ADDISON : So I'm still wearing the rings.
ADDISON : - They're stuck. - Have you tried soap?
DEREK : I hear it's good and slippery.
ADDISON : - You are a very strange person, Derek. - I am just bright and shiny, Addison.
MEREDITH : Bright and shiny.
UNK: So then I popped his shoulder right back in. He didn't even flinch.
UNK: - Your brother is hardcore. - What are...?
BAILEY : - Looks like you've got a full house. - Just waiting on the wife.

UNK: so I added p. r. n. morphine every four hours.
UNK: I've scheduled your endoscopy for this afternoon.

MARK : It's a really tragic one.
UNK: I found out just this morning
MARK : I have over two weeks worth of dry cleaning needs to be picked up,
MARK : stat.
UNK: Cool. That's it?
MARK : We're like a well-oiled machine, you and me.
UNK: I also need you to get me a sandwich from that pathetic excuse for a deli.
MARK : You know the one I like. Go easy on the mayo this time.
UNK: I think he's trying to kill me.
UNK: I don't see why I can't help with my dad's endoscopy.
BAILEY : What about "no working with family" do you not understand?
GEORGE : - I'm not asking to do the... - Fine.
