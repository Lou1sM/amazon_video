Callie : I married the help.
Cristina : - What? - We went to Vegas. My idea.
Callie : - I embrace the trashy. - That's...
Addison : Not that I'm not happy for you, but why married so fast?
UNK: You know the cartoons where there's a starving bear?
UNK: - And it looks at a cute intern? - Well, congratulations!
Callie : Thank you. Thank you.
Callie : Oh, it's small. I know it's small.
UNK: George insisted on paying for it himself.
Addison : - It's beautiful. - You think so?
Meredith : - Yes. - Yes.
Ellis : So, tell me about yourself.
Mark : Well...
Ellis : What's your life like?
UNK: I... I really do want to know you, Meredith.
Meredith : Well, I have a boyfriend.
Ellis : Does he understand the demands of your career?
UNK: - They say they do but... - He's great.
Meredith : - He's a doctor too, so he gets it. - Good.
UNK: Mrs. Henry : - He's... - Have you chosen a specialty?
UNK: No. It's still early.
UNK: Cristina's chosen cardiothoracics.
Meredith : Yeah. Well, I guess I'm just waiting to be inspired.
Meredith : I'm happy now. You know, I feel like I know who I am.
Meredith : When you have someone in your life you really love,
Meredith : I think that's... I don't know. I just...
Meredith : - I'm really happy. - What happened to you?
Meredith : - What do you mean? - You're happy? You're happy now?
UNK: Meredith was a force of nature.
Ellis : Passionate, focused, a fighter. What happened? You've gone soft.
Ellis : Stammering about a boyfriend, saying you're waiting to be inspired?
UNK: You kidding? I have a disease for which there is no cure.
UNK: That would be inspiration enough!
Ellis : Listen to me, Meredith.
Ellis : Anyone can fall in love and be blindly happy,
Ellis : but not everyone can pick up a scalpel and save a life.
Ellis : I raised you to be an extraordinary human being,
Ellis : so imagine my disappointment when I wake up
Ellis : and discover that you're no more than ordinary!
Ellis : What happened to you?
UNK: - How long have you been dating? - Just a couple of months.
Vincent : We live in the same building. I'd see her in the laundry room
UNK: and she's really sexy when she folds clothes.
Vincent : Once we started dating we got really serious really fast.
UNK: Now I'm just kind of like...
UNK: I don't even know who I was dating.
Vincent : I don't even know her middle name.
UNK: I'm trying to fill out forms. I'm stumped on the first question.
George : Rose.
George : That's her middle name. Rose.
UNK: She knows I have a boyfriend, but not that it's you.
UNK: - Just keep it that way. - OK.
Meredith : She's charming, she's fabulous, then suddenly she's the enemy.
Derek : - The enemy? - Just don't get personal.
Derek : - You're being ridiculous. - I am not.
Derek : - OK. It's going to be fine. - Just be careful. She has ways.
Derek : Dr. Grey. Dr. Shepherd for your neuro consult.
UNK: - Hey, George. Are you OK? - Yeah.
Olivia : You seem kind of shaky and sweaty and pale.
Olivia : Is it the marriage? You regretting it?
George : The marriage is fine. Do you mind taking that...
UNK: Taking the bloodwork to the lab for me?
Derek : - Sure. - Thanks.
George : - I think I need to sit down. - George, if you need to talk...
George : Thanks.
Callie : Hey. Are you OK?
Callie : - You're sweating. - No, I'm good.
George : - What's your middle name? - I don't tell anyone.
George : Come on, we're married. I don't even know your middle name.
Callie : OK, I knew it. It's your weird and judgey friends.
Callie : - You let them get to you. - No, it's... I don't...
George : I don't know your middle name. God, I can barely breathe.
Callie : You didn't know my middle name last week and you could breathe just fine.
Cristina : What?
