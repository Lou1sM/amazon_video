UNK: What about a functional MRl? Now, while I'm lucid?
UNK: An MRl is not going to show us anything new.
UNK: No test is going to help us understand what's going on.
Ellis : In five years, you've made no advances
Ellis : and there is nothing else you can do for me?
Ellis : I don't know how you do it.
Ellis : Day in and day out, work with people with this awful disease.
UNK: Oh, I... I see...
Derek : Actually, I'm not an Alzheimer's specialist.
Derek : I just took a special interest in this case because of Meredith.
Ellis : You're what happened to her. I thought you were here for me.
Ellis : To offer me some hope, to tell me about some new treatment,
Ellis : but you're here for her.
UNK: An attending, a neurosurgeon? No wonder she's unfocused.
Derek : I don't think you understand.
Ellis : I understand. I've seen men like you.
UNK: Threatened by a woman who's their equal. You want someone to admire you.
Ellis : And you don't care about the damage you do to her along the way.
Cristina : Get out.
George : I need to lay down.
Izzie : No, no, no. Hey! Hey! Hey, buster!
Izzie : Do you know how much it costs to have these linens laundered?
UNK: I'm sick. Shaking and sweaty. My mouth is dry. My body aches.
Meredith : - Fine. - Karev, replace O'Malley in the OR.
Meredith : Yes.
UNK: I feel sick. I'm nauseous and achy. Can I lay down?
Alex : This is Marina Wagner, your colon cancer patient?
UNK: - Where's O'Malley? - Curled up in the clinic.
UNK: - Is he OK? - Well, he's married.
Richard : Right. OK.
Richard : Ten blade.
Izzie : Stolen non-emergent ER cases and sick hospital staff.
Izzie : This is what eight million dollars buys.
Bailey : I swear on my life if I hear you say eight million dollars one more time...
Izzie : It's not about the money. It's... it's Denny.
Izzie : It's his legacy. I was looking for meaning.
Izzie : - This was supposed to be meaningful. - It will be.
Izzie : Eight million dollars worth?
UNK: Uh, excuse me, are you... Can I... Are you the doctors?
Bailey : - Yes, we are. - Are you a patient?
Izzie : - Like an actual free clinic patient? - Not me. My daughter.
UNK: - Oh, is your daughter sick? - I'm not sick. Can we please go?
UNK: Kelley finds suddenly she has a need for these products.
UNK: And... and we were hoping you might show her how to use them.
Olivia : George, you're married. You should be happy.
Olivia : - You don't look happy. - I'm sick, Olivia.
Richard : All right. You should go home, O'Malley.
Bailey : Clearly whatever you have is contagious.
UNK: - Let's go. - Aren't you from the lab?
UNK: Lab Tech : Yeah, I feel like crap.
George : Is that the lady you gave Marina Wagner's blood to?
Izzie : - Yeah. - You all feel shaky and nauseous?
UNK: Lab Tech : It's awful.
George : - She's toxic. - Callie? A lot of us feel that way.
George : The patient's blood is toxic. It's making us sick.
George : Has the Chief started Marina's operation?
Olivia : They were wheeling her up as I came down.
UNK: What's the extension for OR one?
