UNK: Um... I didn't...
Richard : That's life, O'Malley. That's life.
Richard : Now, this patient. I removed a large tumor from her colon eight months ago.
UNK: She's been undergoing chemo and radiation.
Richard : We thought she had it beat.
UNK: Excuse me? Are you the doctors for Marina Wagner?
Richard : - You brought her in? - She was barely breathing.
Vincent : Think this could be food poisoning? We had sushi yesterday.
UNK: Could be from the radiation.
UNK: - What radiation? - From her cancer treatment.
Vincent : She doesn't have cancer.
Vincent : I'm her boyfriend, I'd know.
Richard : O'Malley, get a CBC, a CHEM-19, and a triple contrast abdominal CT.
Richard : - Excuse me. - Yes, sir.
Richard : What? Is she all right?
Ellis : Richard Webber. My God, you've aged.
Richard : - Ellis? - I was having arrhythmias.
UNK: They wanted to do tests and... I hear you're the Chief of Surgery now.
Ellis : - That's wonderful. - Yes.
Richard : - But I'm stepping down soon. - Stepping down?
Ellis : Well, I can only assume that was Adele's idea.
Ellis : - Meredith. - I'll be right there, Mom. Go ahead.
UNK: She is lucid.
UNK: Mrs. Henry : She woke up this morning with her memory back.
Meredith : They say it's temporary.
Ellis : My God. Obviously, don't worry about work today.
Richard : You need to be with her.
Richard : I mean, this time...
Richard : It's a gift.
Meredith : It's a gift. Right.
Burke : Meredith's mother had some runs of SVT. I'm ordering an echo.
UNK: - And she's lucid. - What?
Burke : - It happens, but it won't last. - Is Meredith OK?
Burke : Seems fine. Her mother's gonna need the best care.
Burke : And you, Dr. Yang, are the best.
Burke : Still not wearing the ring. I'd like an answer.
Burke : - It's been over a week. - I told you it's under advisement.
UNK: - Well, do you not like the ring? - It's a ring.
UNK: It's three carat, diamond cut, platinum. It's the ring.
Burke : Then what?
UNK: Are you using this surgery to pressure me into giving you an answer?
Cristina : - That why I'm not scrubbing in? - I need to give the others a chance.
Cristina : Why?
Burke : The echo please, Dr. Yang.
Burke : - Hey. - Hey.
Izzie : - You been waiting long? - Almost an hour.
Mark : Mm.
Man : - Are you my doctor? - I can be.
UNK: We have a clinic outside. No wait.
Alex : What's wrong with you?
Man : It hurts when I pee.
Alex : - We can help with that. - Yeah, that's easy.
UNK: We can have you out of here in less than an hour.
UNK: Are you hitting on me?
Izzie : We need patients, you need doctors, and we just happen to be surgeons.
Man : - You think I need surgery? - You never know.
Izzie : - It's free. A free clinic. - But my co-pay's only ten bucks.
Izzie : That's lunch.
Alex : - Sounds like TB. - Yeah. Very contagious.
Ellis : You and Meredith are good friends.
Ellis : I can tell.
Ellis : Because you're afraid to look at me.
Ellis : As if I might ask you some personal question about her
Ellis : and you'll accidentally slip.
Ellis : But you don't do anything accidentally, do you?
Ellis : - Has Meredith chosen a specialty? - That's a personal question?
