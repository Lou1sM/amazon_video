ADDISON : - What's his platelet count? - 17,000.
ADDISON : 17,000? Did you transfuse platelets?
ALEX : - Yes, but it didn't help. - Where's the mother?
ALEX : I don't know.
ADDISON : I'm not asking you where the mother is for my health,
ADDISON : I expect you to use your brain. Where's the mother?
ALEX : I don't know. The baby was found in a trash can at a high school.
ADDISON : They left him in a trash can.
ALEX : He's got some inner abdominal bleeding on CT.
ALEX : You wanna run some more tests?
BAILEY : Dr. Shepherd?
ADDISON : I need a stat ultrasound and for you to infuse two grams of IVIG,
ADDISON : if there is no cranial bleeding. Then find out where the mother is.
ADDISON : I need to test for maternal platelet antibodies.
UNK: Can't you do surgery to fix the bleeding?
ADDISON : If I wanted to kill him, I could do that. Damn it.
ADDISON : - Who does this? - Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd?
UNK: There are some people here, about the baby.

GEORGE : The clot's been evacuated. Are we ready to close?
DEREK : Just want to make sure there's no bone fragments.
UNK: - How's Izzie? - As well as can be expected.
DEREK : Never gets easier, you know, losing a patient.
UNK: It's a little less shocking, I guess,
DEREK : but it never gets any easier.
GEORGE : Izzie was in love with him.
GEORGE : Denny wasn't just a patient. They were in love.
UNK: You had sex with Derek in an exam room at the prom?
BAILEY : - Yes. - Last night?
CHRISTINA : - You and Shepherd did it. - Yes.
CHRISTINA : You and McDreamy did the nasty-nasty?
UNK: - Cristina! - Not judging,
CHRISTINA : just trying to wrap my mind around it. You're with Finn and he's with Addison.
MEREDITH : - He's married to Addison. - Yeah.
CHRISTINA : Well, what did Derek say?
MEREDITH : He said, "Meredith, what does this mean?"
UNK: OK. He has sex with you and he's standing there all McGuilty,
UNK: and all he has to say for himself is, "What does this mean?"
MEREDITH : - What does this mean? - I don't know.
UNK: Well, are you gonna go back to Finn?
CHRISTINA : Is Shepherd leaving his wife?
DEREK : - I just... - Hold on with both hands!

UNK: Richard, you can't leave me!
OMAR : Please.
UNK: Richard!

UNK: It seemed to be the best way to get your undivided attention
ADELE : - because here you are. - Adele, listen...
UNK: - Sit down. Sit down! - Adele.
ADELE : - We have an appointment. - Chief...
