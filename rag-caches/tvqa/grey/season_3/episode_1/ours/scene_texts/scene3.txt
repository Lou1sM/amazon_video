UNK: ...is a straight-A student.
UNK: Mine gets a B, she's birthing babies in toilets?
ADDISON : I'm Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd, treating the newborn.
UNK: He has a blood condition. I need to know whose baby it is I'm dealing with.
UNK: Yeah. We'd all like to know that. Sara, talk.
SARAH : - I don't know anything about any baby. - None of us do.
UNK: One of you must, otherwise, you and your parents wouldn't be here.
UNK: Our girls... The principal said that they were the last people
UNK: A MOTHER : in the bathroom before that baby was found.
UNK: We thought before the police show...
FATHER : One of you knows. And you better confess.
UNK: - Don't want Lisa in this. - Police'll be here soon.
UNK: Can't you just do some DNA test so the rest of us can get out of here?
ADDISON : DNA results take days.
UNK: I'm not concerned with getting the rest of you out of here.
ADDISON : If this baby isn't treated, he's going to die.
ADDISON : Now I can do vaginal exams on each of the girls.
UNK: My daughter is 14, she's not sexually active. I won't have you violating her.
UNK: You won't have it 'cause you know it's yours. Tell you what.
FATHER : You have my consent to do what it takes to prove Lisa's innocent.
UNK: You are a sick bastard, you know that?
ADDISON : A child's life is in jeopardy here.
ADDISON : And it's not your consent that I need.
UNK: GIRL 1 : We didn't do anything wrong.
UNK: It doesn't mean it's our baby.
UNK: Do we look like girls who get pregnant and throw their kids in the trash?
UNK: Nice work today, O'Malley. Did Meredith go home with Izzie?
UNK: Yeah, Cristina too. I'm headed there now.
IZZIE : - Yeah, me too. - Oh, great. It's just...
GEORGE : I don't know if Izzie's up for a lot of people.
DEREK : I'm gonna go see Meredith.
DEREK : - All right. - OK.
BAILEY : - Dr. Shepherd? - Yes.
MAN : - Dr. O'Malley. - Yeah?
MAN : I'm with the IDC. Is anyone else in this room?
MEREDITH : - No. - Perform the surgery on Mrs. Toussant?
BAILEY : - Yes. - She was in close contact
MAN : with a victim of the plague.
MAN : - She may have been exposed. - So we may have been.
ALEX : - Yeah. - I can't do this.
MAN : We're waiting on the diagnosis of Mr. Toussant.
UNK: This room's sealed until we know the threat's contained
UNK: - and you're safe. - You're not saying...
UNK: You cannot leave. You two are quarantined.
UNK: IDC has everything under control?
UNK: They work fast. Anyone that was in contact is quarantined.
UNK: Shepherd and O'Malley are not happy.
UNK: Everything's under control if you need to get back to your wife.
UNK: Oh, no. I should check in with the IDC rep.
UNK: Gonna have to stay on top of my hospital.
RICHARD : Keep me posted.
UNK: Hello. Hello!
UNK: I need help. Somebody. Please.
OMAR : I know you can hear me.
OMAR : I see you standing in your giant, white spacesuit.
BAILEY : - Sir? - Yes!
UNK: MAN IN SUIT : No unauthorized personnel beyond this point.
UNK: MAN IN SUIT : IDC regulations.
UNK: I know he's under quarantine, but he's also a patient,
BAILEY : and I will not ignore a patient.
OMAR : Hello out there. Thank God. Thank God you can hear me.
UNK: - How is my wife? - My name is Dr. Bailey. Miranda Bailey.
UNK: Your wife is out of surgery. She's quarantined in recovery, but she's fine.
BAILEY : - You were asking for help? - Know how many day's I've been here?
BAILEY : - It's only been a few hours. - Really?
OMAR : I'm losing... I'm losing track of time.
BAILEY : OK, sir, you're sweating.
BAILEY : I need you to sit down. Get back in the bed.
UNK: What about my wife, Giselle? Can you find out about Giselle?
