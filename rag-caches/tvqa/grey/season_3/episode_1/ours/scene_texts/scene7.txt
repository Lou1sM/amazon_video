DEREK : There are moments, O'Malley,
DEREK : all of a sudden, in a split second, your life changes forever.
DEREK : Before you know it, you're somewhere else.
CHIEF : - Gentlemen. - Chief.
GEORGE : Can we please get out of here now?
MEREDITH : No.
DEREK : A split second.
UNK: Straight tequila, really? You are going to be sorry in the morning.
MEREDITH : I'm always sorry in the morning,
MEREDITH : but tomorrow I start my first day of work so keep them coming.
DEREK : How you doing?
DEREK : Double scotch, single malt, please.
DEREK : So is this a good place to hang out?
MEREDITH : I wouldn't know. Never been here before.
UNK: You know what? I haven't either. First time here.
DEREK : I'm new in town. I've never been to Seattle.
UNK: A new job, so...
UNK: Wow, you're ignoring me.
UNK: - Um... Trying to. - You shouldn't ignore me.
MEREDITH : Why not?
DEREK : Because I'm someone you need to get to know to love.
OMAR : - Really? - Oh, yes.
MEREDITH : - So if I know you, I'll love you. - Oh, yes.
MEREDITH : You really like yourself, huh?
DEREK : Just hiding my pain.
DEREK : So what's your story?
MEREDITH : I don't have a story. I'm just a girl in a bar.
DEREK : I'm just a guy in a bar.
ALEX : How do you not know your kid's pregnant?
ADDISON : You love your kids. You wanna see the best in them.
UNK: OK, then, how do you have a baby and then throw it in a trash can?
UNK: Something happens and you panic.
UNK: You freeze and you wanna hide it and...
ADDISON : ...pretend like it didn't happen.
ADDISON : - I get that. - You get that?
UNK: MORGUE GUY : I do.
UNK: I just don't get what happens afterward.
ADDISON : I don't get how you go back to class and pretend like everything's fine.
UNK: Everything's not fine.
UNK: Oh, it's the blood results.
UNK: Karen and Lisa are not a match.
ADDISON : And then there were two.
OMAR : Miranda, I'm feeling better. A lot better.
OMAR : I think the fever broke, which is good, right?
UNK: - Yes, that's very good, Omar. - How's Giselle?
OMAR : Is she asking for me?
BAILEY : Omar, for Giselle, being exposed to the plague, it...
BAILEY : It complicated things.
UNK: Complicated what things?
BAILEY : We did everything we could.
MEREDITH : No.
GEORGE : - I'm so sorry. - No. No.
UNK: No, no, no!
GISELLE : Omar.
BAILEY : Come on, breathe.
UNK: Stop. No, no, stop. He's hyperventilating.
BAILEY : - I have to go in there. - You can't go in there!
BAILEY : Somebody has to go in!
