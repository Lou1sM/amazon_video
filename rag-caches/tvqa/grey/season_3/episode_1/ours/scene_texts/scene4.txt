BAILEY : Like I said, sir, she came out of surgery just fine,
BAILEY : but I can check on her status again.
BAILEY : You just stay calm until I get back.
UNK: No! No, wait, wait. Don't go. Please.
UNK: Just... Just stay a minute.
OMAR : - Please. - OK, um...
BAILEY : I'm staying.
OMAR : Omar. Call me Omar.
UNK: OK, Omar. I'm... I'm right here.
CALLIE : I brought food.
MEREDITH : George isn't here.
UNK: No, I know. He's in a quarantine because of a thing.
UNK: I was off duty and worried about him and going crazy
UNK: and thought about Izzie so I brought food.
MEREDITH : - For the shiva. - Are you gonna let me in?
ALEX : Yeah.
UNK: Relax. I'm not gonna bring it up. You and McDreamy and the sex.
CALLIE : - I'm not that person. - Good.
GEORGE : - OK. - Good.
UNK: Shiva? Is it shiva if Izzie's Catholic?
UNK: Did you say quarantine?
CHRISTINA : This thing that you're doing, it's not healthy.
CHRISTINA : You gotta take off that dress.
UNK: Get off the floor, take off that dress, and take a shower.
IZZIE : Tell me about shiva.
CHRISTINA : It's something you do when someone dies. We did it for my grandmother.
IZZIE : How does it work?
CHRISTINA : People bring over food, family comes over.
CHRISTINA : It's supposed to help with the grieving. It honors the dead.
IZZIE : - Sounds nice. - Yeah. There's a lot of rules.
CHRISTINA : Seven days of no leather shoes, no work, no sex.
UNK: No sitting on things higher than a foot. No shaving, no...
IZZIE : What?
CHRISTINA : No clean clothes.
CHRISTINA : Izzie, this doesn't have to be shiva.
IZZIE : You know they took his body away.
UNK: I'll never see him again.
IZZIE : How would you feel if you never saw Burke again?
UNK: So we're sitting shiva for Denny.
ALEX : - You want to see him? - See who?
ALEX : - The baby. Your baby. - It's not our baby.
FATHER : I've given you permission to do this, now what's the hang-up?
UNK: The hang-up, sir,
UNK: is that if your daughter doesn't want to do it, I can't force her.
MOTHER : They're 14. They're minors. We still have a say.
CHIEF : No, you don't. If someone doesn't want to submit to a vaginal exam,
CHIEF : they don't have to. It's the law.
UNK: All right, that' it. I'm taking Lisa home.
CHIEF : You do that, sir, and I will have you arrested before you hit the parking lot.
ADDISON : The law isn't the only thing in play here.
UNK: If I do the exam and the girl's a virgin, there could be bleeding,
ADDISON : undue trauma, not to mention emotional stress.
UNK: If I had to guess as to whose kid doesn't have to worry about that...
UNK: - What's that mean? - It'd be nice if Karen had a curfew.
UNK: MOTHER 2 : At least she's not a shoplifter.
MOTHER : Shannon stole one lipstick when she was nine. Get over it.
UNK: I know Lisa is a virgin.
UNK: - Really? How do you know that? - Because she's only 14 years old!
ADDISON : Listen to me.
ADDISON : Derek, you can't do this. We have to talk about this.
UNK: - No, we don't. - Give me a chance to explain.
OLIVIA : Wait. What are you doing with my clothes?
UNK: It was one time! I know that's what people say.
UNK: I know that's what gets said. I don't know how it happened.
ADDISON : Don't know what I was thinking. He was here.
DEREK : You screw my best friend and all you can say is, "He was here?"
UNK: ANOTHER MOTHER : - Get out. - No.
UNK: ANOTHER MOTHER : - Get out. - No. No, I'm not going.
UNK: - Get out of my house now! - We have to talk about this.
ADDISON : I'm holding my ground. I'm holding my ground. We don't quit!
UNK: - We have to work... - Get out.
