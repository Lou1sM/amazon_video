GEORGE : - That's just rude. - We're dead men. No time to be polite.
ADDISON : Safe haven laws.
UNK: All those girls would've had to do was drop that baby off
ADDISON : at a fire station or a hospital.
ADDISON : Now... it's a mess.
CHIEF : What are our options here?
UNK: Blood-typing. We take a sample from each of the girls.
ADDISON : The baby's blood type is double O.
ADDISON : If the girls are A or B it means the baby's not theirs.
ADDISON : Do it.
MEREDITH : Everyone thinks I'll know what to say to her. I don't know what to say to her.
MEREDITH : Dark and twisty Meredith. I'm not dark and twisty.
UNK: And if I am, it's because I live my life under a banner of avoidance.
MEREDITH : I avoid. I'm an avoider.
OMAR : Hello?
IZZIE : - Hey. - Hey.
FINN : So can we...
MEREDITH : Izzie. I gotta go check on Izzie.
CALLIE : Don't take it personally. It's the doctor thing.
IZZIE : What?
CALLIE : Four years of high school, four years of college,
UNK: four years of med school. By the time we graduate we're in our late 20s
CALLIE : and we've never done anything except go to school and think about science.
CALLIE : Time stops. We're socially retarded.
CALLIE : I mean, look at me. I'm in love with a guy who won't say he loves me back,
CALLIE : and here I am, in his kitchen, hoping he comes home and notices me.
CALLIE : I'm a total freak.
CALLIE : I'm that girl in the back of the class who eats her hair.
UNK: And Meredith...
CALLIE : ...she's 17 years old. We're all 17. This is high school with scalpels, Finn.
GISELLE : - Oh. - Yeah.
UNK: - How are we doing? - We're not taking off the dress
UNK: - and we don't want to discuss it. - Stop with "we. "
UNK: Do not "we" me.
UNK: Finn is downstairs.
GEORGE : - With Callie. - So? What's Callie gonna do?
UNK: Just don't ask. Go.
MEREDITH : Fine.
MEREDITH : I don't know what to say to you.
ADDISON : I don't know what to say to me either.
IZZIE : When Dylan died... when the bomb went off...
UNK: ...how did you feel?
UNK: It's not the same. We weren't...
MEREDITH : He wasn't...
UNK: But when he died, did you feel...?
IZZIE : What?
IZZIE : Like you were moving in slow motion.
MEREDITH : He was there and then he wasn't.
MEREDITH : Like I blinked and he was gone.
IZZIE : I feel like I'm moving in slow motion.
IZZIE : Like I'm moving in slow motion and everything around me
IZZIE : is moving so fast and I just wanna go back...
IZZIE : ...to when things were normal.
UNK: When I wasn't poor Izzie laying on the floor in her prom dress with her...
IZZIE : But I am.
IZZIE : So I can't.
IZZIE : And I'm...
IZZIE : ...just stuck.
IZZIE : And there's all this pressure 'cause everyone's hovering around me
IZZIE : waiting for me to do something or say something
IZZIE : or flip out or yell or cry some more. And I'm happy to play my part.
IZZIE : I'm happy to say the lines and do whatever I'm supposed to be doing
IZZIE : if it will make everyone feel more comfortable.
IZZIE : But I don't... I don't know how to do this.
IZZIE : I don't know how to be this person. I don't...
IZZIE : I don't know who this person is.
UNK: ALEX through the door of the bathroom, to Izzie lying on the floor, unresponsive : Izzie...
IZZIE : How did this happen?
IZZIE : How did we end up here?
IZZIE : Why am I alone?
IZZIE : Where's Denny?
MEREDITH : You're not alone, Iz.
DEREK : Trail mix and warm soda. Who puts warm soda in their locker?
UNK: As usual, Cristina's too lazy to stock her locker with food.
UNK: Oh, now I hit the mother lode here.
UNK: I got granola, cookies, muffins. Who eats this much?
GEORGE : That's Izzie's locker. She ate a lot. Said it kept her energy up.
CALLIE : - Eats. - What?
UNK: Eats. You said "ate. "
UNK: Eats, present tense. She didn't die.
UNK: Feels a little like she did. She's never coming back here.
UNK: You know... I don't think she's ever gonna be the same.
