UNK: OK. She's been in there all night. We have to do something.
ALEX : - Yeah. - Yeah.
ALEX : - Yeah. - Why are you all looking at me?
UNK: - This is familiar territory for you. - There is nothing familiar about this.
MEREDITH : Unfamiliar. Denny died. The man she loves died.
CHRISTINA : Yeah, but you're all dark and twisty inside.
MEREDITH : - Dark and twisty? - The mother with the Alzheimer's,
UNK: the father you don't talk to.
ALEX : Tequila thing. The inappropriate men thing.
GEORGE : You are dark and twisty and now Izzie is dark and twisty.
UNK: So I'm the president of People With Crappy Lives?
GEORGE : Seriously, we have to do something.
GEORGE : Someone has to go in there.
UNK: Richard voice over : The seven years you spend as a surgical resident
UNK: Richard voice over : will be the best and worst of your life.
UNK: Richard voice over : Look around you.
UNK: Richard voice over : Say hello to your competition.
UNK: - Hi. Izzie Stevens. Washington. - Alex Karev. Iowa.
IZZIE : This is nice. They throw a mixer for the new interns.
ALEX : It's just an excuse to get us all happy and drunk before they torture us.
ALEX : - What program are you in? - Surgery.
ALEX : - Seriously? - Seriously.
IZZIE : What?
UNK: I'd picked you for Gynie or Peds or something.
IZZIE : You don't think I can be a surgeon? I can be a surgeon.
UNK: - Surgery's hardcore. - I'm hardcore.
ALEX : You won't last the first year.
UNK: - Hey, Izzie... - What?
GEORGE : Maybe you should... change your clothes.
UNK: - Maybe something more comfortable. - Stop it.
UNK: ALEX through the door of the bathroom, to Izzie lying on the floor, unresponsive : - Izzie. - Stop it, I mean it.
IZZIE : Stop talking.
IZZIE : There is nothing to talk about, do you understand me?
IZZIE : There is nothing to discuss.
GEORGE : I'm so sorry.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, me too.
UNK: MORGUE GUY : - You're a surgeon? - Yes.
UNK: Usually don't send surgeons.
BAILEY : What do we need to... How do I do this? What do we...?
UNK: Just ID the body before I take him to the funeral home.
UNK: MORGUE GUY : - So I don't take the wrong guy. - That happens?
UNK: MORGUE GUY : You wouldn't believe how many times.
BAILEY : That's him. That's Denny Duquette.
UNK: Great. Load him up.
UNK: MORGUE GUY : And... sign.
BAILEY : - When's the funeral? - No funeral.
UNK: MORGUE GUY : The family asked to have the body sent to Memphis.
UNK: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
BAILEY : I'm sorry.
GEORGE : I'm so sorry.
UNK: - Why are we making sandwiches? - That's what you do when someone dies.
MEREDITH : - You cook. - I know what to do when someone dies.
CHRISTINA : I am a Jew. I know food and death.
CHRISTINA : - It's shiva. - Is it shiva even if she's Catholic?
UNK: Well, shiva's what I know how to do, so yeah, it's shiva.
UNK: If we're sitting shiva for Denny, then we should order in.
CHRISTINA : Making sandwiches is not the same as cooking.
MEREDITH : Sandwiches are comfort food.
CHRISTINA : What's wrong with you?
UNK: Everything is fine. It's Izzie we're worried about.
UNK: Oh, what did you do?
MEREDITH : Denny died, Burke got shot.
MEREDITH : Let's just have some perspective, and remember what I did
MEREDITH : - is a tiny, slightly small... - Whatever. Spit it out.
MEREDITH : I lost my panties last night.
