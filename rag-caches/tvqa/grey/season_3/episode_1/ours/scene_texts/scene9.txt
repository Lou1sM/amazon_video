GEORGE : You've lived. You've done things.
UNK: And you've got the hair.
GEORGE : And the hot wife and the beautiful ex-mistress who pines for you.
DEREK : - She's pining for me? - My point is you've lived!
UNK: If you die, who cares? If I die...
UNK: What, this is it?
GEORGE : Callie told me she loved me and I just sat there.
GEORGE : I mean, I wasn't ready...
UNK: What, and now I'm gonna die?
UNK: I'm not even going to get a chance to say "I love you" back.
DEREK : Do you? Do you love her?
UNK: - She loves me. - That wasn't the question.
GEORGE : Maybe.
GEORGE : Eventually.
ADDISON : I could.
GEORGE : One day, soonish.
UNK: "Soonish?"
UNK: "I will love you soonish?"
GEORGE : You ever tell Meredith?
GEORGE : You ever tell her that you love her?
MEREDITH : No.
DEREK : I did.
UNK: But... then with Callie...
UNK: ...you know... it's different, but...
DEREK : You should tell her.
DEREK : Even if it's soonish.
DEREK : You should tell her before it's too late.
GEORGE : You mean before I die of the plague?
DEREK : Before somebody else comes along.
UNK: I once set the bone on the hind leg of a cow.
UNK: Come on. Now, that I believe.
UNK: He does boring animal stories, and she's too stupid to care.
UNK: Oh, I'm gonna...
UNK: Oh, I'm gonna leave the room for a period of time for no reason whatsoever.
FINN : I don't know what happened last night.
FINN : - Between you and Derek. - Finn.
UNK: And I don't wanna know.
FINN : We never said that we were exclusive.
MEREDITH : - But you have plans. - Yeah.
FINN : Well, I didn't say I wasn't pissed off.
FINN : I said we weren't exclusive. That's all I wanted to say.
UNK: Oh, and... And this.
FINN : I know you think you're scary and damaged.
CHRISTINA : Dark and twisty.
FINN : It makes you feel like you don't deserve good things,
FINN : but you do. And Derek... he's bad for you.
UNK: But me, I'm a good thing.
FINN : And if there's a race, if there's a ring, my hat is in.
ADELE : I made an appointment for a reason.
ADELE : I scheduled the time because I had something important to say and you
ADELE : - made me wait. - I have a situation.
UNK: I spent my life waiting. Waiting for you to finish med school,
ADELE : waiting for you to come home at night, waiting for you to leave that... woman.
ADELE : - I'm done waiting. - Adele...
UNK: It's time for you to make a choice. Me or this hospital.
UNK: It's time for you to retire, Richard.
UNK: Well, it's obvious then. This baby can't possibly be Shannon's.
UNK: Look at her. No one can stay a size two and be pregnant.
UNK: - I've tried it. - What're you saying?
UNK: - Sara's a little pudgy. - At least she's not sleeping around.
UNK: - I am short on time. - Shannon didn't think
UNK: - about boys until Sara. - You have some nerve.
UNK: Do I need to remind you two who the teenagers are?
UNK: - She started it! - Enough, OK?!
UNK: Both of you come with me. Let's go.
UNK: - Let go of me! - No. Move.
ADDISON : There he is.
ADDISON : That's your son.
