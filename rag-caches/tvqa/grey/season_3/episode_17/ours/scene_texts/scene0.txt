Cristina : - It's gingerbread. - Yeah.
Cristina : You're not getting this, are you? OK, this is 99 cents.
Cristina : OK? You can buy anything for 99 cents.
Denny : Oh.
UNK: It's small. It's, um, a tiny size.
UNK: It has, uh, cat-type creatures on it. But it is a chair.
UNK: For 99 cents, you can buy furniture. That is America, man.
Joe : That's Taiwan, man.
UNK: This ferry thing's bad. Think you should...
Cristina : I am coping.
Addison : OK?
Cristina : I'm coping. So, uh, shut up and look at all my crap!
UNK: You're in charge of my interns. Put them to work anywhere but here.
UNK: - We can't go anywhere. - You're concerned. I understand.
Bailey : There's been a disaster, there's work to be done. Go. Now.
Callie : All right, they need bodies down in the clinic. Let's go down there.
Callie : Hey. Bailey's right. We can't help. All we do is sit and go crazy.
UNK: - I can't. I need to be here. - We're all freaked.
Callie : We just need to stay out of the way. Got it?
Callie : Let's go.
Alex : Do you or your immediate family have a history of cancer?
