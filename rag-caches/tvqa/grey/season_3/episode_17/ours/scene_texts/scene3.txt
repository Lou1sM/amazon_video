Meredith : - I fought. - No, you didn't.
Denny : - And you can't stay here, Meredith. - I don't want to!
Denny : Yeah, you do.
Denny : It's easier, but you can't,
Denny : because George's dad died, because Izzie lost me.
UNK: And Cristina? When she was 9, she was in a car accident with her father,
UNK: and he bled out in front of her while they waited for an ambulance.
Denny : - And Alex... - Stop.
Denny : They are barely breathing. This will break them.
UNK: And none of them deserves that.
Denny : And this...
Denny : This is the big one, so you pay attention.
Denny : Do you know what kind of miracle it is that Derek is who he is?
Denny : Do you know how rare it is that someone like him even exists?
Denny : He's still an optimist.
Denny : He still believes in true love and magic and
Denny : soul mates. He's waiting for you,
Denny : and if you don't come back from this, you will change who he is.
Meredith : Oh, God.
UNK: Here we go. Move! Code blue! Get the cart in there!
UNK: - I got it. - You got the cart? Bring it in.
Bailey : What about a cardiopulmonary bypass?
UNK: We could do it here.
Richard : Page Burke and the surgical team. Get him here now.
UNK: You know, this is... This is quality Sudoku, Joe.
UNK: - This is, like, $2 worth of Sudoku. - Good to know.
UNK: There's been no change. I thought you should know.
Cristina : - No kidding. - Well, some do come back from this.
UNK: Know what? I am not a civilian. I know the science here.
Cristina : - It's drinking time. - Not yet.
Burke : - You have a responsibility to Meredith. - Uh-uh.
UNK: I don't do this stuff. I mean, you should know. I go to great lengths.
Burke : - You were there when I needed you. - After.
Cristina : After I knew you were gonna make it.
UNK: OK, I'm not proud. OK? I just...
Meredith : I can't.
Cristina : I can't go back there. I can't go back there and watch her.
Burke : Listen to me.
Burke : This is about you and the woman you call your person.
Burke : And you do know the science here.
Burke : And if she dies, and you are sitting here when that happens,
Burke : I can't see you coming back from that.
Burke : Come and say goodbye to your friend.
Meredith : I was swimming.
Meredith : I was fighting.
Meredith : And then I thought, just for a second...
Meredith : I thought, "What's the point?"
UNK: And I let go.
Meredith : I stopped fighting.
Meredith : Don't tell anybody.
Denny : OK.
