Denny : Meredith...
Meredith : My mother's dead, isn't she?
Bailey : Yes.
Meredith : It's OK...
Meredith : I think.
Meredith : I think it's OK.
Mark : So she's OK?
Bailey : Yeah.
Addison : We never had that.
Addison : He never... felt that way about me.
Meredith : I did.
Addison : You know, sometimes I think what a waste it is to throw away all that history.
Mark : I'm flawed. I'm a wreck.
UNK: But you... It wasn't a game.
UNK: Sixty days.
UNK: Go 60 days with no sex, no other women.
UNK: Sixty days cold turkey, then, maybe, I'll believe you.
UNK: - So I only have sex with you? - No.
UNK: No sex with anyone.
Addison : Grow up, Mark.
Addison : - Find another way to scratch the itch. - Say I do. You'll give us a real try?
UNK: - The couple thing, no sneaking around. - If you make it, yes.
Mark : OK. We're on.
UNK: Oh, and, Addison? If I'm not having sex, neither are you.
UNK: Who would I possibly be having sex with?
Alex : - How you doing? - I hurt all over.
UNK: - How's your friend? - Well, she pulled through.
Jane : Good. That's great.
Jane : - And... nobody's... - Claimed you? No.
Alex : - No, nothing yet. - So we still don't know anything?
Alex : Oh, no. Not so. We learned a lot about you today.
UNK: We know your heart is healthy. We know your blood type is B positive.
UNK: You eat healthy, your cholesterol level is excellent and you're not diabetic.
UNK: Your lungs don't look like smokers',
Alex : and you don't drink alcohol on ferries in the morning.
UNK: And you're about 32 years old.
UNK: And your baby is a girI.
Bonnie : Really?
UNK: - A girI? - Yeah.
UNK: And I think I am married. I feel married.
Alex : - Yeah? - Yeah.
Alex : See, now I know more about you than some of my closest friends.
Jane : That's pathetic.
Bailey : You held it down. Thanks.
Sydney : What you did today with Meredith... Everybody's talking.
Sydney : Chief resident talk.
Sydney : OK, I'm talking, to myself, but...
Sydney : You're gonna give me a run for my money.
Bailey : Yeah, I am.
Izzie : I let you down.
Izzie : And I get it if you don't trust me right now, but...
Izzie : Please, George.
Izzie : It's me.
Izzie : It's us.
Bonnie : Please.
MVO : At the end of a day like this,
MVO : a day when so many prayers are answered and so many aren't...
Richard : You've been gone a long time.
Richard : I know you think you died when the Alzheimer's started.
Richard : I know it's a relief to you.
Bailey : I know.
Richard : But it doesn't feel like a relief to me.
Richard : I'm not relieved.
UNK: I miss the sound of your voice.
Richard : I miss talking to you.
Richard : I miss you.
Richard : I dyed my hair...
Richard : ...for the ladies.
MVO : We take our miracles where we find them.
MVO : We reach across the gap...
MVO : ...and sometimes...
MVO : ...against all odds...
MVO : ...against all logic...
MVO : ...we touch.
Callie : Izzie.
