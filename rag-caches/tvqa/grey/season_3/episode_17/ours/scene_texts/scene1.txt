Callie : then maybe we could be, I don't know, friends?
Callie : Or you can keep on the way you are
Callie : and be that person that George used to know.
Izzie : You don't get to decide that.
Izzie : - George decides. - I know what he'll decide.
UNK: I would think about it, you cannot afford to lose another friend,
Callie : not when people around you keep...
Izzie : Keep dropping like flies. Is that what you were about to say?
UNK: So all of you just disappear at will?
Jane : - What happened? - I drowned. That's it.
Bonnie : - Really? Then why are we here? - Again.
Bonnie : I can't do this if you're gonna keep saying you drowned.
Bonnie : Do you have any idea how much that hurt?
UNK: You know, when you came into the ER, you were so brave, so strong.
UNK: I was in shock! And you guys doped me up.
UNK: And you know what? In retrospect, what happened to me really sucked.
Bonnie : I was young and beautiful and in love.
Bonnie : I was getting married in four months, and then I was dying.
Bonnie : And here you are, all happy and perky to be dead.
Meredith : You think I want to be here? I swam. I fought...
Meredith : ...hard. The water was cold.
Denny : But that thing in the tub, what was that?
Meredith : It wasn't anything. It was...
Meredith : - You see me in the tub? - I do not see women in the bathtub.
Denny : I wish I saw...
Denny : - We know things. - You had to think about it.
Liz : - No daughter of Ellis... - Not an Ellis Grey thing.
UNK: - Ah, a Derek thing. - I would never...
Bonnie : You would. I know crappy things have happened to you,
Bonnie : but how can you be a surgeon and have so little respect for life?
UNK: How... Oh, come on.
UNK: Who are you here for?
Jane : - What? - I'm waiting on my wife.
Man : Car hit her.
UNK: Can you believe that? On the ferry?
Man : She was run over on the ferry.
Man : They haven't said much. Hard as hell to get any of these people to talk to you.
Derek : Yeah, I'm...
Derek : My girlfriend was there, too.
Derek : And I don't know...
Derek : - I don't know what's gonna happen. - It's out of our hands.
Man : - It's up to the doctors now. - Yeah.
Bailey : Yeah.
Man : - What's her name? - Meredith.
Man : - I'll put her in my prayers. - Thanks.
UNK: I need to get in and find the source of bleeding.
Denny : It's just gonna happen again.
Meredith : Where is something to wipe up this blood?
Dylan : - Fool me once... - Oh, good, yeah.
UNK: Show up now, be a smart-ass. We have a job to do. Where are you?
Dylan : It's a waste of time. She's gonna get it or she's not.
Meredith : - Get what? - It doesn't matter how you got here.
Dylan : You're either in this thing or you're not. There is no in-between.
