Dylan : And cowboy here can get pissed off, because for all his tough talk,
UNK: he's no different from Bonnie. He's stuck.
Meredith : - And you're not? - No.
Bonnie : - Please. - Stop. I had a good life.
Dylan : I helped when I could. And when that shell went off in my hands,
Dylan : I completed my task. I saved you.
Richard : Another epi?
Bailey : We've been pushing epi an hour and a half.
Richard : Check another lead.
UNK: - Asystole on three leads, sir. - What about her temp?
Bailey : - Down to 86 degrees. - Eighty-six?
Richard : It's 86 now? It was 89.
UNK: Afterdrop phenomenon.
UNK: Water. Get me some water.
Derek : You broke her. You called her ordinary.
Derek : You taught her time and time again that nothing she does,
Derek : ever, is good enough.
UNK: Every good thing Meredith is happened despite you.
Derek : She may not survive this, and that's on you.
Derek : - That is on you. - Derek.
UNK: - The woman is just... - A black hole, no question.
Addison : She can't help herself, she certainly can't fix Meredith.
Derek : - It's my fault. - Don't.
Derek : I wasn't there for her.
UNK: - You were human. - She was pulling away from me, and I...
UNK: ...I... I just...
Addison : You think that she went in the water on purpose?
Derek : She knows how to swim.
Derek : She's a good swimmer.
UNK: Derek, you don't know that she's...
Addison : No, you do not get to break down. You do not get to fall apart.
Addison : Not when there's still a chance, and there still is a chance, Derek. OK?
Denny : OK.
Denny : OK.
Denny : - What are you looking for? - Something strong.
UNK: The next time Bonnie bleeds out, I'm gonna dope her...
UNK: - Why are we talking about her? - If I find the source...
Denny : - She can't be saved. - This isn't fair.
Meredith : I could save her. If you'd just give me a chance, I could save her.
Denny : - What happened in that water? - I swam.
