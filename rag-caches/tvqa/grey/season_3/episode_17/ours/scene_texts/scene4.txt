Jane : What?
Callie : - Izzie. - You can see her?
Bailey : No.
UNK: But, sometimes,
Denny : we'll be in the same place at exactly the same time.
Richard : And... I can almost hear her voice.
Denny : It's like I'm touching her. I like to believe she knows I'm there.
UNK: That's all you get. That's it.
Denny : Moments with the people you love.
Denny : And they'll move on. And you'll want them to move on.
Denny : But still, Meredith, that is all you get, moments.
Meredith : - Is this really happening? - I don't know.
Denny : This is your afterlife, not mine.
Izzie : - Any change? - No.
UNK: - George, we can't do this today. - What did you say to my wife?
UNK: - We both said things. - I saw her face.
George : She didn't say anything. Why would you pick now to throw down?
Izzie : I didn't. I...
Izzie : - I can't lie about how I feel. - Actually, you can.
George : You can. People lie all the time. They hold their tongues and they wait.
George : If I'm not making a mistake, you're a jerk,
George : and if I am, I'm gonna need you.
George : I need you, and you keep taking that away.
Derek : Put on the CO2 monitor. You page Dr. Burke?
UNK: He's in trauma doing a cardiopulmonary bypass.
Derek : - On Meredith Grey? - Yes, sir.
UNK: OK, push one of atropine.
Bailey : - Billy, what's her temp? - We're up to 96.
UNK: - That's good. Good. All right. - Now we get her heart beating.
Burke : OK, draw an ABG, push one of epi, a gram of mag and an amp of calcium.
UNK: I don't want to be here. I want to go back.
Bonnie : There wasn't a lot of time.
Meredith : - I'm out of time? - Well, we're not sure, baby.
UNK: Oh, God. I can't.
UNK: I wa... Oh! I...
Meredith : - I had intimacy issues. - Yeah.
Meredith : Do you know how stupid that seems now?
Denny : - Yeah, I do. - It's not enough.
Meredith : It's not enough, just a whiff of Derek
UNK: or just... or Cristina.
Meredith : I need to go back. Please.
Cristina : I can't, I can't...
UNK: Not gonna happen, not today.
UNK: You're not gonna die on me, not today.
UNK: V- fib. Give me the paddles.
Derek : Clear.
UNK: - How many epis? - Six.
UNK: - External pacer? - Not catching.
