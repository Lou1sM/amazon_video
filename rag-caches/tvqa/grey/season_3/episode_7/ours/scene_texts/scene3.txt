DONNA : Don't pay any attention to him. You're doing well.
VICKY : Better than I did when I first found out.
UNK: We need to run pre-op labs. Make sure everything's in working order.

IZZIE : Yeah.
MARK : Big day, Donna.
MARK : You excited?
DONNA : Excited doesn't begin to cover it.
UNK: You're gonna do great.
UNK: Jesus.
UNK: What do you say, Preston? Ready to go fishing?
UNK: We're all going fishing.
UNK: - That's why we're up here. - No, I mean...
UNK: Just me and you. Just us.
UNK: They're almost done. Then we can all go.
UNK: Right. All seven of us.
UNK: - That is a nice-looking picnic basket. - Thank you.
CHIEF : Concierge at the hotel put it together.
CHIEF : and an assortment of Seattle soft cheeses. Like some?
BURKE : No.
ALEX : Dude, he brought silverware.
GEORGE : You should talk. Have you ever been camping before?
ALEX : What?
UNK: T- shirt and sneakers? You'll freeze your ass off.
ALEX : - I'm wearing a jacket. - Just do me a favor.
UNK: Don't crawl to me in the night when you wanna huddle for warmth.
UNK: It's a good-looking tent, Joe.
UNK: Uh... you and Walter got room for one more?
JOE : Thought you'd be sleeping with one of the doctors.
UNK: Oh, Preston's already got O'Malley for a roommate.
UNK: And just between you and me? Those other tents are pretty puny.
UNK: Well, Walter and I were sort of wanting to share this one. Just the two of us.
JOE : But I guess if you really want to.
ALEX : Chief, I don't think you really...
CHIEF : They've offered, Karev.
UNK: Chief? They want to be alone.
DEREK : Oh.
CHIEF : - So you are... - Uh, chief.
UNK: That's wonderful. Man-love.
UNK: It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
CHIEF : My cousin's gay.
CHIEF : So I'm hip.
UNK: And Brokeback Mountain, all of that.
BURKE : - Who's ready to go fishing? - Me! Me. I'm ready.
UNK: Yeah, let's go. OK. Yes! Fishing.
MEREDITH : Guess what I'm doing today? Removing a man's penis.
