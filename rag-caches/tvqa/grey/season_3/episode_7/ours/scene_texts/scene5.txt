ADDISON : Today her baby's dead.
UNK: So, uh... how long have you and Walter been together?
UNK: Ten years. On and off.
UNK: But now? Definitely on.
JOE : - Thinking about kids. - Kids?
CHIEF : That's a big step.
JOE : You have kids?
CHIEF : No. I work a lot.
UNK: Adele and I, we...
CHIEF : She always said she didn't want to raise kids alone.
JOE : Walter says the same thing.
CHIEF : He does?
JOE : I'm always working at the bar. That's where our problems come in.
JOE : What are you going to do, right?
UNK: If I'm not there, who's gonna run the place?
BAILEY : Exactly.
UNK: But Walter?
JOE : If I have to make a change, I'll do it.
UNK: I can't imagine my life without him, you know?
BURKE : Very nice, O'Malley.
GEORGE : At least once a month my dad would take me and my brothers to White River.
UNK: Well, your dad taught you well.
BURKE : How are you and Dr. Torres doing these days?
GEORGE : Good. She doesn't know it yet, but we are.
GEORGE : Excellent, even.
UNK: For a while she wanted, I don't know, a certain level of commitment.
UNK: And I just didn't feel like I was ready... Now I am though.
BURKE : - So you're stepping up? - I'm stepping up.
UNK: You knew, right? When it was the right time with you and Cristina?
IZZIE : Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, 'cause you asked her to move in with you so you knew.
GEORGE : Right.
UNK: - You OK? - Absolutely.
BURKE : 'Cause...
BURKE : - We're here to fish, remember? - Right.
UNK: I'm gonna see if I can get a better bite downstream.
MEREDITH : OK.
UNK: I'm sorry, Donna. The labs don't lie.
DONNA : - Breast cancer? - I'm sorry. I'm really...
MARK : The needle aspiration showed abnormal cells in your breast tissue.
MARK : Rare, but it happens.
DONNA : So the hormones I've been taking are essentially giving me cancer?
MARK : Yes. That's why we need to stop the hormone therapy
MARK : - and start the treatment. - Or the cancer will get worse?
DONNA : - The operation? - There'd really be no point.
MARK : Once we stop, your breasts will shrink,
MARK : your facial hair will grow back.
UNK: She'll become a man again.
UNK: What if I do the operation, keep taking the hormones, what happens then?
MARK : Donna, you really want to treat this now while it's still in its early stages.
DONNA : - So if I keep taking the hormones...? - You'd be feeding the cancer.
DONNA : I could die?
DONNA : Are you saying if I become a woman,
DONNA : I could die?
ADDISON : They are a happy couple.
ADDISON : Look at them.
ADDISON : They love each other.
ADDISON : They should have everything.
ADDISON : Happy people should have happy things happen to them.
IZZIE : Yeah.
UNK: - I gotta go tell them. - Wait.
CALLIE : The moment you tell them, they won't be happy anymore.
UNK: They won't thank you. You'll be the person who killed their dreams.
UNK: So give them a few more minutes. Just let them be happy.
CALLIE : A few more minutes.
UNK: - So you're getting back with Callie? - Yeah.
ALEX : Trust me, man, I don't think you really want to do that.
GEORGE : - Really? - Really.
UNK: When I get back I'll tell her we shouldn't see each other anymore
UNK: and then when she asks why, I'll say, "Well, Alex Karev
GEORGE : thinks our relationship isn't such a good idea. "
UNK: Do you think that'll do the trick?
ALEX : Fine. Suit yourself.
DEREK : This was my camping trip. I was going to come alone.
BURKE : So why did you invite me?
UNK: Because, this is a guy trip. You know? Mountain men.
BURKE : - You don't have any friends, do you? - Of course I have friends.
BURKE : - Guy friends? - Yes.
DEREK : I just need peace.
DEREK : Space. I have a right to space. You go and invite half the hospital.
UNK: It's because I have guy friends.
SYDNEY : There you are! I have been looking all over.
