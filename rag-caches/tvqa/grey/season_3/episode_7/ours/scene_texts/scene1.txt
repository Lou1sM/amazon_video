CHRISTINA : Go.
UNK: Stevens. Conference room. Spend the day with a peer counselor.
UNK: The hospital's already making me see a shrink.
UNK: Now see a peer counselor. So go. Meet your peer. Get counseled.
UNK: - Exciting procedures on the board, huh? - Yes, Dr. Bailey.
UNK: Which should I start with?
UNK: - Are those...? - Monopoly pieces.
UNK: Twenty-one of them to be exact. Mostly houses and hotels.
ERIC : I also swallowed the thimble, the racecar, the iron and top hat.
UNK: Oh! And the shoe.
MOM : Eric and his older brother don't always get along.
ERIC : He wouldn't let me play with him and his friends.
ERIC : - This way nobody could play. - Yang, what do you recommend?
CHRISTINA : - Is this even surgical? - Yang.
UNK: Track and inventory all pieces. Measure the progress in X-rays.
UNK: - And keep examining the stool. - Very good. Enjoy.
UNK: Oh. Dr, Bailey, isn't this more of a nurse's job?
BAILEY : Are you too good to help that boy?
BURKE : Yes.
CHRISTINA : No. Definitely not.
UNK: I just thought I'd be more help if I was assisting you in a surgery.
UNK: - No surgeries for you. - I'm sorry. I don't understand.
BAILEY : I don't understand why you erased my name from the OR board.
UNK: - What are you talking about? - No, don't do that.
BAILEY : Don't give me that fake confused look. It irritates me.
BAILEY : You know exactly what I'm talking about. You erased my name
BAILEY : from Burke's Humpty Dumpty surgery. I know it and you know it.
BAILEY : What I don't know is why.
MEREDITH : I...
CHRISTINA : ...have no comment.
BAILEY : No surgeries, Yang.
UNK: OK, before you start, there are rules to this friendship thing or whatever.
MARK : The Dirty Mistresses Club has rules?
UNK: You'd think a bunch of dirty mistresses would be a little less uptight
MARK : - about things like rules. - Number one, no flirting.
MEREDITH : Second, no talking about Derek. And C, no giving me the face.
UNK: - The face? - The McSteamy face.
MEREDITH : Doesn't work on me. I'm immune.
UNK: You know, if I'd gone off to the woods, I would've invited you to keep me warm.
MEREDITH : Breaking rules one, two, and three.
CHIEF : Oh!
UNK: Sydney? You're my counselor?
UNK: Peer counselor. We're equals.
DEREK : Oh.
SYDNEY : - How are you? - Fine. I'm fine.
UNK: Now, that is outside Izzie talking. OK?
SYDNEY : How's inside Izzie?
UNK: So, you and Derek? You guys together or...?
UNK: Just answer and I'll stop asking.
MEREDITH : Derek and I are taking some space.
MARK : From each other or he's taking some space from you?
