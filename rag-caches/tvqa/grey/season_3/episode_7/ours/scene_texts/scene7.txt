GEORGE : - That doesn't leave us with much. - That's not a question.
CHIEF : All right.
BURKE : - O'Malley's a scrapper. - A scrapper? He's going to destroy him.
BURKE : He's tougher than he looks. Silent, but deadly.
DEREK : This is immature and stupid. I would think you'd agree.
BURKE : They're letting off some steam. This is why you don't have guy friends.
DEREK : - This is why I should have come alone. - Ready? Let's go.
UNK: I've wanted this since I can remember. I've waited forever. I'm not stopping.
MARK : - Donna, listen to me. - If you don't, I'll find a doctor.
UNK: You'll have a hard time finding a surgeon who...
UNK: - I'll find one. - Donna, I'm trying to save your life.
DONNA : As a man. I am not a man.
DONNA : I'll fight the cancer. I'll just fight it as a woman.
UNK: For God's sake! Wake up, Daniel!
DONNA : My name is Donna.
UNK: I'm not gonna stand by and watch you kill yourself.
DONNA : I need Vicky to love me.
UNK: But I need her to love me.
UNK: Oh, my God. Please tell me it's going to stop hurting soon.
CALLIE : You're almost done.
UNK: When our son's 15 and yelling at you that you never did anything for him,
TED : you can guilt him with the wrist.
ADDISON : Ted, Jamie, I need to talk to you.
ADDISON : - About the baby. - Dr. Montgomery.
JAMIE : You have to say it.
JAMIE : I won't believe it unless you say it.
JAMIE : You have to say it.
CHRISTINA : Thanks for this, Izzie. Thank you.
CHRISTINA : - No good deed goes unpunished. - Good deed?
UNK: You're making me dig crap. I didn't ask her to spend the day with me.
UNK: Ooh.
UNK: Eww-y.
SYDNEY : How's it going in there? Any luck?
CHRISTINA : I can't have that grinning puppet head stare at me another second, so go.
UNK: - Cristina. - Hey, this is my crap.
UNK: Bailey assigned me this crap. You get Sydney.
IZZIE : Fine. Come on, Sydney. We can go.
UNK: Okey-dokey, Smokey.
ERIC : Man, I thought my brother and I had problems, but you two are morons.
UNK: OK, well, swallowing Monopoly pieces wasn't exactly a genius move.
UNK: - You could've really hurt yourself. - I didn't, did I?
UNK: My mom's gonna make my brother let me play all I want.
UNK: I get to play. That's all that matters. Getting to play.
CHRISTINA : - That makes you smart? - You're fishing through my poop.
ERIC : How smart are you?
BURKE : - Take it back. - That's right, Karev.
BURKE : - Don't take it back. - You don't know why they're fighting.
UNK: Arms up, O'Malley. Don't drop your arms!
UNK: Hey! No wrestling! No wrestling! Come on!
DEREK : - Stupid. - George is defending his honor.
