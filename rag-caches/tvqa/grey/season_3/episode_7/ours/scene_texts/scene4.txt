UNK: You got an SRS? Seriously?
UNK: He's, well... she is one of Sloan's patients.
UNK: God! That should be me.
UNK: I should be turning a penis into a vagina. That should be my penis.
UNK: I have to hide!
UNK: Sydney is my peer counselor.
UNK: "Heal with love" Sydney?
UNK: - Oh. Eww. - Eww.
UNK: I'm supposed to be shadowing her and "dialoguing"
IZZIE : unless I can come up with a medical reason not to? Anybody? Anything?
UNK: A couple houses and the dog. That's nine pieces so far.
IZZIE : I love the dog. I'm always the dog when I play Monopoly.
UNK: Uh... I got a page.
ADDISON : Jamie Carr. She slipped and fell in the shower this morning.
JAMIE : I can't see my own feet. I did this.
UNK: Ooh. Nasty break.
UNK: - She hasn't had any meds for the pain? - She refused.
ADDISON : - She's toughing it out. - Don't tough it out.
CALLIE : - Just say yes. - Well, the baby. I...
JAMIE : I know Dr. Montgomery said it was all right, but...
JAMIE : I'll suffer.
UNK: Is he OK? He was kicking like crazy and now...
ADDISON : - It's possible that he's just sleeping. - So our son sleeps.
UNK: He's just sleeping, Jamie.
JAMIE : - Do I need a cast? - Definitely.
CALLIE : But first we need to straighten the bones.
CALLIE : Put your arm in this fancy sling. Use gravity to help realign the bones.
UNK: Would you excuse me for just a moment? I've got to...
VICKY : Trade you.
MARK : Vicky.
VICKY : Insurance forms.
VICKY : Donna gets the surgeries and I do the forms. Super fun.
UNK: Well, you seem to be handling this remarkably well.
VICKY : Well, I left. At first.
UNK: When she... When he told me.
VICKY : You plan a life together, you know?
VICKY : Kids and suddenly that's all out the window.
VICKY : Suddenly your husband is this other girl in your house
UNK: who's borrowing your eyeliner and waxing her legs.
MEREDITH : But you came back. Why?
UNK: Honestly, right now? I have no idea.
UNK: I'm really going to miss the penis.
UNK: - You OK? - Yeah. I'm fine. I'm OK. I'm good.
UNK: Don't make me climb over this stall. I'll do it, but I'll be really pissed
UNK: because I don't know you that well.
CALLIE : You're not OK.
ADDISON : I don't know why.
ADDISON : There's no reason that this should affect me this much.
ADDISON : - I'm used to this. I am, but... - Used to what?
ADDISON : That woman.
UNK: She's eight months pregnant
UNK: and yesterday she's just as healthy as can be, and today?
