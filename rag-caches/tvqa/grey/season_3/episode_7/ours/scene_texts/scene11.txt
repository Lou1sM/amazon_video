BURKE : I have no wisdom. There is no wisdom here.
UNK: Hmm. So, in other words,
DEREK : we're all a bunch of idiots.
BURKE : Yes.
UNK: Who wants to go home?
UNK: Really? You didn't get the hint? Because it wasn't subtle.
UNK: - I'll find you a new peer counselor. - Good.
SYDNEY : I lost a kid.
SYDNEY : My first year. It was my fault.
SYDNEY : And I just couldn't...
SYDNEY : So I had a breakdown.
UNK: They gave me time off and when I came back, I put a smile on my face
SYDNEY : and everybody thought I was fine.
SYDNEY : I lost a kid.
SYDNEY : It comes in waves, Izzie.
SYDNEY : There's a lull and then another wave hits you.
SYDNEY : I wasn't trying to pry.
UNK: I just wanted you to know that it's OK not to be fine sometimes.
IZZIE : I miss him.
IZZIE : All the time, I miss him.
UNK: It's not waves. It's a constant.
IZZIE : All the time.
IZZIE : And I walk through the doors of this hospital and I want to be here.
CHRISTINA : I do.
IZZIE : But... I don't know...
IZZIE : ...if I can be a surgeon again.
IZZIE : And I can't talk about it because it scares me too much.
JOE : OK?
MEREDITH : OK.
MEREDITH : You came back.
SYDNEY : I came back.
UNK: - The surgery went well? - Sloan did a great job.
VICKY : I was heading home.
VICKY : I was on my way to the airport and then...
UNK: You know you asked before why I came back the first time.
UNK: You know, I tried not to.
VICKY : I went on dates.
VICKY : Had a lot of great first dates
VICKY : with guys who were planning to stay guys.
UNK: But you have a great date and you wanna go and tell your best friend about it.
UNK: And my best friend is Daniel.
MARK : Donna.
UNK: And then you have a few bad dates and...
VICKY : She's my best friend.
VICKY : She knows me. She loves me.
VICKY : She's... my husband.
UNK: I know it sounds crazy.
UNK: My family thinks I'm crazy.
UNK: But you don't abandon someone just because there's baggage, you know?
IZZIE : Yeah.
VICKY : At the end of the day, it's Donna.
VICKY : Even when she hurts me.
VICKY : Even when I hate her.
UNK: She's who you want to talk to.
MEREDITH : Not all wounds are superficial.
ADDISON : So, you're sleeping with Sloan.
GEORGE : Was.
ADDISON : Me too. Was.
ADDISON : Which is just a hailstorm of self-loathing and misery.
IZZIE : Yeah.
JOE : You want to...
ADDISON : ...get a drink or something?
UNK: I would love to.
ADDISON : Some other time, then.
CHRISTINA : Definitely.
MEREDITH : Most wounds run deeper than we can imagine.
UNK: He's fine. He'll make a full recovery.
MEREDITH : You can't see them with the naked eye.
CHRISTINA : - You're back. - Yes.
CHRISTINA : I'm glad you're back.
IZZIE : Me too.
UNK: I don't like to be paged when I'm off. Is it important?
CALLIE : - George, we need to talk. - Yeah. I think we do.
UNK: - It's about your dad, George. - My dad?
MEREDITH : And then there are the wounds that take us by surprise.
MARK : So, this could be just a drink
MARK : or this could be more than a drink.
UNK: - You're breaking the rules again. - I don't care.
UNK: You and me, we could have fun. Dirty mistresses unite and all that.
UNK: - I cannot start something with you. - You could.
UNK: I'm not camping in the woods.
MARK : Start over, Meredith. Start fresh.
MARK : Saved by the bell.
MARK : Order me another beer.
DEREK : Hi. I'm Derek Shepherd.
GEORGE : - What are you doing? - We met at this bar, you remember?
UNK: We met and we... Well, you said "I'm just a girl. "
UNK: I said, "I'm just a guy. "' And we started this thing.
DEREK : We started this thing and you didn't know anything about me.
DEREK : The good, the bad, the wife.
DEREK : You didn't even know my name.
DEREK : You didn't know me.
DEREK : I want you to know me. I want to start over.
DEREK : From the beginning.
DEREK : So, hi. Derek Shepherd.
MEREDITH : You walked away. And now it's too late.
MEREDITH : There's too much water under the thing or whatever.
MARK : Meredith.
JAMIE : Please.
UNK: The trick with any kind of wound or disease
UNK: is to dig down and find the real source of the injury.
MEREDITH : Hi, I'm Meredith Grey.
UNK: Very nice to meet you, Meredith.
MEREDITH : It's nice to meet you.
MEREDITH : And once you've found it...
MEREDITH : ...try like hell to heal that sucker.
