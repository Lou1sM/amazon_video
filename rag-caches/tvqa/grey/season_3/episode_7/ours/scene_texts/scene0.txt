UNK: Because I'm going camping with Shepherd.
CHRISTINA : But why?
UNK: Getting away. Out of the city.
DEREK : Men being men. Mountain men in the wild.
UNK: Ah, the open road. The road not taken. The uncharted course.
BURKE : - Terra incognita. - Oh, OK.
MEREDITH : Most of the time, you need to go step by step.
MEREDITH : First probing the surface, looking for any sign of trouble.
BURKE : We do have to make one stop.
MEREDITH : A mole or a lesion or an unwelcome lump.
CHIEF : - Mountain men in the wild. - Yeah.
UNK: T erra incognita.
CHIEF : - This is my first camping trip. - You don't say.
DEREK : So Preston, any other little surprises?
UNK: Sunscreen and insect repellent. A shovel to bury your poo.
UNK: Izzie, I'm not five. Zip me.
UNK: If Callie calls, will you tell her,
GEORGE : tell her I'm a mountain man. I'm a man of the mountain.
GEORGE : - Right, Dr. Burke? - OK, him I invited.
GEORGE : Izzie baked us treats.
UNK: Have fun with your, um... space. Or whatever.
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: I just thought we needed an extra tent. Maybe Joe misunderstood.
JOE : You want to follow us or should we follow you?
UNK: This is unbelievable.
ALEX : Hey, guys.
GEORGE : That wasn't me. I swear.
GEORGE : What are you doing?
MEREDITH : Most of the time, we can't tell what's wrong with somebody
UNK: by just looking at them.
MEREDITH : After all, they can look perfectly fine on the outside
MEREDITH : while their insides tell us a whole other story.
MEREDITH : Derek's camping. T aking time. Getting space.
CHRISTINA : Prestons do not go into the woods.
UNK: A guy named Preston is gonna get his ass kicked by a squirrel.
UNK: It's a slumber party. They do it outside. We do it inside.
UNK: That's really the only difference.
MARK : - You seen what's his face? - Alex Karev.
UNK: Poor bastard gets a thrill out of tagging along after me.
MEREDITH : He's camping.
UNK: How'd you like to get a thrill out of tagging along after me?
MEREDITH : - Dr. Bailey makes the assignments. - Dr. Bailey says it's fine.
