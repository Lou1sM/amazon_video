UNK: Oh. Dr. Yang needed some help with this patient. She needed some help.
DEREK : Oh.
UNK: Patient care always comes first. So...
UNK: Oh, what...?
SYDNEY : - Oh, I'll just wait. - Wait?
UNK: Yeah, for you to finish. Then we'll dialogue.
MEREDITH : OK.
MEREDITH : So, what happens with Donna now?
MARK : She goes back to being an unhappy man who's stuck with a penis.
MARK : - There are millions of us out there. - You're unhappy with your penis?
MARK : - I could be a lot less unhappy. - You are a complete and total whore.
UNK: - Maybe, but I'm more fun than Derek. - Really? How?
UNK: Maybe it's for the best that he's taking some space.
MARK : Maybe you two aren't meant to be together.
UNK: You really do need to learn how to mind your own business.
MARK : Look, Derek,
MEREDITH : on the outside, he holds it all together, but...
MARK : ...he's damaged goods, Meredith. It's my fault. I damaged him.
MARK : Maybe forever.
UNK: Do you really want to drink from a poisoned well?
VICKY : Dr. Sloan?
VICKY : - You have to talk to her. - What's wrong?
UNK: Donna says she wants to go through with the operation.
CHIEF : Joe and Walter got tired of not catching any fish. Went for a hike.
CHIEF : What do you make of that?
BURKE : Joe and Walter?
UNK: Oh, no, no, no. Joe and Walter are great.
UNK: I mean that we haven't caught any fish. Any theories?
DEREK : Just one. Fish generally don't like to go where there's a lot of noise.
GEORGE : - Notice anything going on with Burke? - No.
UNK: Because before I thought I saw...
GEORGE : What are you doing? You don't use bait when you're casting.
GEORGE : It's going to fall off before it hits the water.
UNK: - Here, here, here, here. - She's sleeping with Sloan, dude.
ALEX : - What? - Callie. She's sleeping with Sloan.
GEORGE : - No, she's not. - I'm telling you, as a friend,
ALEX : Torres is doing Sloan.
GEORGE : You better take that back.
UNK: Yeah, people chatting, laughing, moving around, that sort of thing.
DEREK : That lets the fish know they're not alone.
UNK: That's the theory.
BURKE : - So I invited other people. - I'm saying, it's not a frat party.
UNK: Take it back!
UNK: Oh, for God's sake! What are you guys doing?
UNK: Break it up! Break it up!
CHIEF : I don't condone fighting. I don't like fighting.
UNK: I think it is pointless and foolish.
CHIEF : But you two idiots seem determined to beat the hell out of each other,
CHIEF : so if you're going to do it, you're going to do it by my rules.
MARK : - Rules? - Yes, O'Malley. Rules.
UNK: To help protect your hands,
CHIEF : - so you don't do irreparable damage. - You're dead.
UNK: Damage that'd end your careers before they started.
CHIEF : So with that in mind, we're gonna do open-handed combat.
BOTH : - A slap fight? - Open-handed combat.
DEREK : This is ridiculous. Karev is going to kill him.
BURKE : - Not necessarily. - No punching, kicking.
CHIEF : No wrestling moves of any kind. Now, any questions?
