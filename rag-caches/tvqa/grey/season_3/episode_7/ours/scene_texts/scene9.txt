GEORGE : You are, right?
GEORGE : Right.
BURKE : Still a little bleeding there.
CHIEF : Hold on, Walter.
UNK: You got it?
BURKE : I always have it.
BAILEY : - You want something? - He is my patient.
CHRISTINA : I've been with him all day.
UNK: If there's any chance that I can get in on this surgery...
BAILEY : Why'd you erase my name from the board?
CHRISTINA : - Don't know what you're talking about. - You want to go head-to-head with me?
BAILEY : Right now? This second? In this moment?
BAILEY : You chose your own fate.
UNK: - Oh. You've been avoiding me. - What? No. Oh, no.
UNK: I'm not. I'm just...
UNK: This surgery, really interesting.
UNK: I guess we can watch and talk at the same time.
MEREDITH : OK.
SYDNEY : So tell me about Denny.
ALEX : What?
SYDNEY : Yeah, it helps.
UNK: To... to talk about what happened.
SYDNEY : So, as much as you can, tell me about what happened

UNK: - OK, we are done here. - Izzie. It really...
SYDNEY : - It helps to share. - No. I don't want to share with you.
IZZIE : Know what I've been doing all day? Sifting through feces.
IZZIE : I would rather sift through feces than talk to you.
IZZIE : And now you bring up Denny like you want me to gossip with you?
SYDNEY : I understand this must be difficult...
UNK: You understand? Really?
UNK: What, you cut someone's LVAD wire? You fell in love with a man and he died?
SYDNEY : - Well, no. But... - Then what the hell could you know?
MARK : Grey, what's our next step?
MEREDITH : Continue the primary incision of the ventral side of the shaft.
UNK: I am surprised you agreed to do the surgery.
MARK : People don't come to me to fix what's on the outside.
MARK : They come to me to fix what's on the inside.
UNK: So if that means giving someone a straighter nose or bigger breasts
UNK: or if that helps a person get by,
