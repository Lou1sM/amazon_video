UNK: Karev said Sloan's been sleeping with Torres.
UNK: He what?
UNK: O'Malley! Arms up!
UNK: Next time we're not going camping with straight guys.
UNK: Oh, God!
UNK: So you're getting paid to look at penises all day?
UNK: I'm studying for McSteamy's reassignment surgery.
CHRISTINA : - You like McSteamy? - Yes. I mean, no!
UNK: No, not like that.
UNK: Just, you know, he thinks I'm better off without Derek's baggage.
UNK: Thinks there's too much history there. Maybe in his own twisted way,
UNK: he's just trying to protect me.
CHRISTINA : Protect you?
MARK : Maybe.
ALEX : Hey...
UNK: ...uh, when your mother was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
CHRISTINA : - why didn't you tell anyone? - She asked me not to.
CHRISTINA : Why?
CHRISTINA : - It was right to keep her secret? - Yes. Why?
CHRISTINA : Even if it meant you had to fish crap out of a toilet for years to come?
UNK: OK. Rewind. Start at the beginning. Whose secret are you keeping?
CALLIE : Wait.
UNK: - What the hell happened? - He was fine one minute...
UNK: Eric, lay down, OK?
CHRISTINA : Abdomen is rigid.
UNK: There's blood in the vomit. He's perfed! Page Bailey!
BURKE : A lot of blood, but it didn't penetrate the galea.
WALTER : - Is that a good thing? - We don't have to do deep stitches.
UNK: - You're using a fishing hook? - Don't worry. We sterilized it.
UNK: Also clipped off the barb. It's as good as a needle.
DEREK : Wound's clean. Keep some pressure on it.
DEREK : - Got it. - We'll do stitches now, all right?
UNK: - Is it gonna hurt? - Yes.
JOE : It's OK.
CHIEF : - Karev, you want to sew him up? - No. Forget it. I want an attending.
ALEX : Thanks, dude.
UNK: We're doing crazy MacGyver surgery. I want what's best for my guy.
UNK: No offense.
BURKE : Don't worry. Dr. Burke's really good at doing this.
