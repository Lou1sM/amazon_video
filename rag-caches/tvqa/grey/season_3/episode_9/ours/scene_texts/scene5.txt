UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : Is she better than Dr. Burke?
IZZIE : She's good. Really good. Nobody's better than Burke.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : - Then why can't I have Dr. Burke? - I don't know.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : Do me a favor. Could you find out?
IZZIE : - Hey. Have you seen George? - No.
IZZIE : - He is acting so weird. - So is Cristina.
IZZIE : What is wrong with everyone today?
MEREDITH : I was going to come and find you. What did you want to talk about?
CALLIE : - Panties. - Callie, what are you up to?
UNK: - I'm going to kick Meredith's ass. - Get off!
UNK: I was discreet. I was a good friend and didn't have to be.
UNK: And then you go and do this?
MEREDITH : - Do what? - Callie, use your words!
CALLIE : Panties, Meredith.
UNK: I'm talking about the panties I pulled off the bulletin board!
CALLIE : Not to mention the adulterous McSex I witnessed. You remember that?
UNK: I'm sorry, but she's little and you're hurting her!
CALLIE : You told George. My night with McSteamy was not yours to share.
UNK: That's what this is about? Your sex with McSteamy?
CALLIE : - You told Izzie. - No! No, no!
MEREDITH : Callie! You told me you slept with someone! You never said it was Sloan.
MEREDITH : George told me it was Sloan.
CALLIE : George? George told you.
CALLIE : - Who told George? - Maybe perhaps the guy you slept with.
CALLIE : George thinks I betrayed him. And I didn't.
CALLIE : - I didn't. We were broken up. - Well, go tell George.
UNK: - She went all cage fighter on you. - I know!
GEORGE : How's my dad doing?
IZZIE : George, your ex is hardcore. Passionate, but hardcore.
UNK: - Yeah, I know. How is he doing? - He's fine, George.
UNK: And my mom? She driving you crazy? Has she offered to iron your scrubs?
GEORGE : She does that. She offers to iron things. Weird things.
UNK: They're fine. They're just, um...
DEREK : - What? - Confused.
UNK: Some stranger's operating on your dad's heart and they both want to know why.
UNK: I have no idea what to tell them.
UNK: Cristina, tell Izzie why Dr. Hahn is doing my dad's surgery instead of Burke.
GEORGE : Go on.
UNK: Look, Dr. Hahn is an incredible surgeon.
UNK: Your father is in great hands. And nothing else matters.
UNK: Wrong. There's a lot of people with fathers here and it matters to them.
UNK: George, I know this is scary. I understand that.
IZZIE : But Burke. I didn't come back until I was ready.
IZZIE : Preston Burke is ready.
UNK: Look, I just can't talk to you about this.
UNK: It's none of your business and just please stay out of this.
IZZIE : - What do I do about your parents? - You don't do anything.
GEORGE : Your job is to watch, remember?
UNK: I'm just... Sorry.
UNK: You might consider leaving that alone until she goes into the OR.
JANELLE : About that. When's that going to happen?
UNK: There's a shard of glass in my heart.
ALEX : You'd be surprised how long people can live with stuff inside.
UNK: Glass, shrapnel, bullets.
MARK : I saw a guy once with half a chair leg in his chest.
MARK : That was one hell of a splinter.
JANELLE : Can we focus here?
UNK: Well, it looks like we'll have the OR in a few hours.
UNK: So if I get hit by a car, thrown through a window, have a big shard of glass
