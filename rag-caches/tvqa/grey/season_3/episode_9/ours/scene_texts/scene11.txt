CHIEF : Come in.
BURKE : Chief, we need to talk.
UNK: Y es, Dr. Burke. I think we do.
UNK: Dr. HAHN : - You're lucky, you know. - Pardon?
UNK: T o study under Burke.
HAHN : If your little intern brain can retain any of what he teaches you,
UNK: maybe you'll become half the surgeon he is. And that's pretty damn good.
HAHN : If you tell him I told you this, he'll never believe you.
BAILEY : - Karev. - Dr. Montgomery. How is she doing?
ADDISON : She made it through the surgery.
UNK: So did the baby which is, well, it's like I said, the kid's a fighter.
UNK: You think she'll call the dad?
UNK: I think it takes more than a well-meaning speech
ADDISON : to get a girl to make a commitment like that.
CHRISTINA : Yeah.
UNK: I appreciate it, though. Your take. It was surprising.
UNK: Lackey. I dabbed blood all day.
ADDISON : You're a decent guy, Alex.
ADDISON : I'd hate to see Sloan beat that out of you.
DEREK : - Anyway... - Y eah. Thanks.
UNK: - All right then. - OK.
UNK: I would have helped you if you'd told me.
BAILEY : Burke.
BURKE : I cannot. It's been a long day.
BURKE : And I just cannot.
DEREK : - I thought you were my friend. - I thought you were my surgeon.
CHRISTINA : In some ways, betrayal is inevitable.
CHRISTINA : When our bodies betray us, surgery is often the key to recovery.
CHRISTINA : When we betray each other.
CHRISTINA : When we betray each other, the path to recovery is less clear.
UNK: It was both ou r idea. T o rob the ban k.
CHRISTINA : - It was both of us. - I know.
UNK: I j ust... I cou Id n't do it anymore. It wasn't...
MEREDITH : You did the right thing.
UNK: Y eah?
CHRISTINA : Then how come I walked across the parking lot
UNK: and realized I can't go home?
UNK: But where am I supposed to go?
IZZIE : - Hey. - Hey.
IZZIE : So Dr. Hahn.
CHRISTINA : Yeah.
GEORGE : He's my dad and I'm scared.
GEORGE : You of all people know what it's like to have someone you love in the hospital.
UNK: You do not get to bring up Denny to me ever again, do you understand?
IZZIE : I'm sorry.
IZZIE : Don't try to apologize. Not now, not yet.
MEREDITH : OK.
IZZIE : Maybe tomorrow.
MEREDITH : OK.
DEREK : You watched his hands all through surgery.
DEREK : You knew.
MEREDITH : I can't say anything.
UNK: There are things Cristina told me. She's my friend.
MEREDITH : I can't say anything.
UNK: No. No. That is not how this works.
UNK: How could you know what you knew or suspected and not even tell me?
MEREDITH : You cleared him for surgery, Derek. How did you not know?
MEREDITH : You can't be angry with me. She's my best friend.
UNK: And right or wrong, she...
DEREK : What?
MEREDITH : She was there when you weren't.
UNK: We do whatever it takes to rebuild the trust that was lost.
UNK: And then there are some wounds, some betrayals,
UNK: that are so deep, so profound...
UNK: ...that there's no way to repair what was lost.
UNK: And when that happens...
UNK: ...there's nothing left to do, but wait.
