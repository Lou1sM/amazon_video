CHRISTINA : When you got shot, I walked away.
UNK: And you cannot let that go, can you?
CHRISTINA : Well, I'm sticking now. OK, I'm sticking.
UNK: You know how tired I am?
CHRISTINA : How scared I am every time we go into surgery? But I do it. For you.
CHRISTINA : Do you know how scared I am when we go into surgery?
UNK: I don't just worry about my career now. I have to put yours on my back too.
CHRISTINA : - We are a team. - There is no team. There is no team!
UNK: There is only me making allowances for your emotional shortcomings!
UNK: We shouldn't say anymore.
CHRISTINA : No.
CHRISTINA : We shouldn't.
UNK: Well, look who's here!
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : Look how wrinkled he is. Thank God I brought the iron.
GEORGE : Mom, what's going on? They paged me to your room. Are you OK?
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Fine. It's just that...
DEREK : - What? - You want me to?
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : No, I'll do it. Here's the thing. We appreciate everything
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : you've done for us.
UNK: The strings you've pulled with Dr. Burke and Dr. Hahn.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : Last thing we want to do is cause trouble because
UNK: we heard how much stress you've been under.
UNK: You and Meredith and Callie.
GEORGE : - Izzie! - I thought they knew.
UNK: And we hope you won't be mad,
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : but we rescheduled the surgery for tomorrow
CALLIE : - because... - We're sticking with Dr. Burke.
GEORGE : What did you say to them?
UNK: - We asked her opinion. - I asked you to stay out of this!
UNK: - I just told them what I thought... - Get out!
DEREK : What?
CHRISTINA : George. You don't talk like that to anyone.
CHRISTINA : Dad.
UNK: Did Dr. Stevens tell you that she's on probation
GEORGE : because the last time she was allowed to interact with patients someone died?
IZZIE : It was really nice to see both of you.
DEREK : You know the guy that caused the accident? An OR just cleared up.
UNK: You available to scrub in with me?
BURKE : - Shepherd. - Burke?
ADDISON : What's going on?
UNK: Dr. Burke... We got a pregnant woman with traumatic cardiac tamponade
UNK: from glass piercing her heart.
ALEX : - Addison asked for you. - You can't do two surgeries at once.
BURKE : No, I can't.
ALEX : She's bleeding like crazy. What do you want to do?
UNK: Burke? My guy can't wait much longer.
BURKE : Dr. Hahn is here. Invite her to scrub in with you, Dr. Shepherd.
UNK: I'll take the glass piercing the heart.
MEREDITH : OK.
UNK: - Hey, Karev? - Yes, sir?
UNK: Make sure that Dr. Yang scrubs in with me.
UNK: Everybody gets a surgery but me.
CALLIE : We were broken up as in not together.
GEORGE : - I can't do this now. - I slept with Mark to get over you.
CALLIE : It didn't work. It was a mistake, but I did not betray you, George.
BURKE : I wouldn't... I would never do that.
UNK: I can't do this now!
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : - Where are you taking her? - She's having an operation.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : Oh, no. What's wrong with her?
BAILEY : She has some bleeding in her chest and they need to operate.
