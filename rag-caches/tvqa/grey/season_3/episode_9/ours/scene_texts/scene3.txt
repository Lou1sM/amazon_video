IZZIE : - Why are you getting paged? - I have to go.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : You're pretty.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : Nothing sexual between you and Georgie? Not even a little bit?
UNK: - Louise! - What? I just want Georgie to be happy.
UNK: OK. Let's just prep you for surgery.
UNK: Anything you would've done different, Dr. Hahn?
UNK: Given the size of the wound? I would've given up sooner.
UNK: So how've you been, Preston? Last time I saw you, you stole my patient's heart.
UNK: Then you got shot. Karma rocks.
UNK: What brings you from Seattle Presbyterian to Seattle Grace?
HAHN : A consult. And knowing how much my being here would annoy you.
BURKE : On the contrary, it's always a pleasure. Though not as much as when you leave.
MEREDITH : Do you think I could get in on Erica Hahn's surgery?
UNK: - I heard she's amazing. - Who?
MEREDITH : Dr. Hahn. She's doing a consult. I wonder who the VIP patient is.
UNK: Um... get him to CT.
UNK: - May I have my father's chart? - Dr. Hahn.
CHIEF : I was pleasantly surprised to hear you were joining us today.
HAHN : I'm always ready to lend a hand, Dr. Webber.
UNK: George. Hey, how's your dad?
UNK: Here's his chart. He's in room 3975. Down the hall, third door on the right.
GEORGE : - I'll be there in a minute. - OK.
CHIEF : I'll escort you, and you can tell me what it would take to steal you away
UNK: from Seattle Presbyterian.
CHIEF : We could use an extra hand around here.
GEORGE : - Callie. - Hey.
GEORGE : You broke up with me. Unless I'm missing something?
UNK: It doesn't mean... I'm just asking about your dad.
GEORGE : - Why? Why do you care? - Because I care about you.
GEORGE : Right. I guess that's why you slept with Mark Sloan.
UNK: It makes sense.
ADDISON : Did Dr. Bailey see the chest X-ray?
UNK: No, but with decreased breath and low pulse ox,
MEREDITH : Janelle will need a chest tube.
UNK: I'm dabbing out glass splinters
ALEX : - and she gets to do a chest tube? - You signed on for this.
JANELLE : This is not a good day for me. This is not a good day for me at all.
ADDISON : The baby looks good, Janelle. The heartbeat's strong.
ADDISON : Want to call the father?
JANELLE : You could, but that would require speaking to him, which I don't do.
UNK: Hearing he's a daddy from a random doctor might not go over well.
UNK: - So the baby's father doesn't know? - No.
JANELLE : And he's never going to.
CALLIE : - Grey, can I speak with you? - I'm setting up a chest tube.
UNK: - I need to talk to you. - I'll come find you.
ALEX : I can suture. I've done it before.
UNK: When you can Z-plasty and barely see the scar, call me.
MARK : Until then, dab and clean, dab and clean.
UNK: How's plastics, Karev? Everything you've ever dreamed of?
BAILEY : - We're not doing a chest tube. - What's going on?
UNK: Ms. Duco, there's a shard of glass going into your heart.
IZZIE : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: Have you seen Dr. T orres?
DEREK : No. Quite a morning. Fourteen injured, two dead.
MEREDITH : I know. There's a lot of blood and blood.
MEREDITH : You know, there's a girl who literally has a shard of glass in her chest.
DEREK : Come here.
UNK: Larry Dickerson. The guy that crashed the fish market.
DEREK : Subdural hematoma, along with air in his mediastinum. Look at his spine.
MEREDITH : - Spinal stenosis. - Yeah.
MEREDITH : Narrowing of the spine most often a result of aging.
MEREDITH : Causes numbness in the legs and feet.
UNK: His case is so advanced, I doubt he could even feel his feet.
UNK: - Which means? - He shouldn't have been driving.
BURKE : You paged me?
DEREK : Patient has air in the mediastinum. I wanted you to take a look.
