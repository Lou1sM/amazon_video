MEREDITH : - Shouldn't have been driving. - I know.
UNK: T racheal injury. Going to the OR for the subdural?
DEREK : As soon as one becomes available.
UNK: What's going on with Cristina?
BURKE : - What do you mean? - She kicks me out of bed at 5 : : 00
UNK: so she can have girl talk with Meredith, and now I can't find her.
UNK: She was supposed to be my intern. I had to get my own CT. What's going on?
UNK: Nothing. Cristina's fine. She's just working really hard.
BURKE : I'm sure I don't have any idea.
UNK: Mm-hmm.
UNK: Don't mention Cristina to Burke, OK? It's just not a good idea.
UNK: - What did you talk about this morning? - Bank robberies.
UNK: Which isn't really the point. OK?
UNK: She was jogging and, well, just cut her some slack today, OK?
MEREDITH : - Not that I should interfere. - But you're going to anyway.
MEREDITH : I'm just going to ask once. Very nicely.
MEREDITH : Please?
UNK: Please? Please?
DEREK : Know what says thank you like nothing else?
MEREDITH : I'm leaving now.
MEREDITH : Hey. Derek's looking for you. He says you left a patient in CT.
UNK: - Shh. I'm trying to hear. - What's going on?
CHIEF : - Dr. Yang? - Yes, sir?
CHIEF : When you see Dr. Burke, tell him I need to speak with him.
CHRISTINA : Of course, sir.
UNK: Is that Dr. Hahn from Presbyterian talking to George's dad?
CHIEF : Mr. O'Malley has elected to have Dr. Hahn perform his valve replacement.
CHRISTINA : - But what about Dr. Burke? - Dr. Burke's been replaced.
UNK: So what if he replaced me? I'm no longer on his father's surgery.
UNK: That's good if it means you stop obsessing.
CHRISTINA : George didn't just replace you. He told the chief. The chief knows.
UNK: For all we know, Erica Hahn's being considered the new head of cardio.
CHRISTINA : The chief asked me to tell you that he has something important
CHRISTINA : to talk to you about.
BURKE : - Oh. OK. - So we need to align our stories.
BURKE : This is why I feel like I'm covering for you. I don't line up stories.
UNK: You think it's me? That's not fair!
UNK: It's done. The chief wants to talk to me, so I will talk to him.
UNK: I am not telling him a story, Cristina.
BURKE : I'm going to tell him the truth.
CHRISTINA : Burke. Burke!
UNK: Still getting a heartbeat?
IZZIE : Happy to say. And it'll get stronger once you've had your surgery.
UNK: Can I ask why you guys switched from Dr. Burke to Dr. Hahn?
UNK: We didn't. Georgie did.
IZZIE : - Did he say why? - Not really, no.
UNK: - Georgie and him have a falling-out? - Not that I know of.
UNK: Is something going on with George and Dr. Hahn?
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : - Here we go again. - There's nothing going on.
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : I already told her. Dr. T orres is the one who loves George.
UNK: Well, then why did Dr. T orres break up with him?
UNK: Why did Dr. T orres break up with him? Between us.
IZZIE : - Well, how much did George tell you? - Everything. I'm his mother.
UNK: Then you know that Callie is a little out there.
IZZIE : I've seen more of her body than of my own.
UNK: It's too much information for me.
UNK: I mean, nobody needs to be naked that often.
IZZIE : He didn't tell you that?
IZZIE : I don't know why they broke up.
UNK: George seemed to like her and he kind of needed her.
UNK: Remember the George and Meredith thing.
UNK: - Wait. George and Meredith? - I knew it!
IZZIE : George didn't tell you that either.
UNK: First Meredith, then Dr. T orres and now this Dr. Hahn?
UNK: MR. O'MALLEY : O'Malley men are studs.
UNK: He isn't a stud, just handsome.
UNK: OK, people. Focus. George is not dating Erica Hahn.
UNK: MRS. O'MALLEY : Why would he want her to perform his father's surgery instead of Burke?
