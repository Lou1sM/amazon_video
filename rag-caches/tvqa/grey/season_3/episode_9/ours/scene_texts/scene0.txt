UNK: Give us a sec?
DEREK : When I get back, there better be some sex.
MEREDITH : - Why are you all sweaty and ick? - I jogged here.
UNK: We don't jog. You don't jog.
UNK: - Cristina? - What if Derek robbed a bank?
DEREK : - What? - Say he was robbing a bank,
UNK: and you waited outside because it was your job to drive the car.
MEREDITH : - Why would Derek rob a bank? - Go with me.
MEREDITH : - Derek's robbing a bank. - And gets caught.
UNK: But no one knows you're involved. Because you were driving.
UNK: OK, Derek's in jail, I'm in a mystery car. What's the question?
CHRISTINA : Would you turn yourself in?
CHRISTINA : Or would you stay quiet and let Derek go down, though you were a participant?
UNK: Or would you, you know, stand by him?
MEREDITH : Well, whose idea was it to rob the bank?
UNK: I don't know. I don't know. His. But you helped.
CHRISTINA : Could you live with yourself
UNK: if you just walked away and let the man you love take the fall?
MEREDITH : If you tell me, maybe I can help.
MEREDITH : - If you tell me. - No, I'll see you at work.
UNK: Cristina, you don't jog.
MEREDITH : We don't jog.
CHRISTINA : Has George said anything to you?
MEREDITH : About what?
CHRISTINA : I jog. Sometimes. Without you.
CHRISTINA : - How's your dad? - His surgery is today.
CHRISTINA : - You have nothing to worry about. - I'm not worried. Not anymore.
CHRISTINA : What do you mean by that?
IZZIE : Hey.
UNK: You and Meredith having a "we're best friends, we're cool" secret time things?
IZZIE : Sorry. I'm cranky. Candy-striping makes me so cranky.
UNK: - Cristina's leaving. - So I can have my girlfriend back?
IZZIE : What's wrong with her?
UNK: Where were we?
BURKE : Why are you acting like the sky is falling?
UNK: The sky isn't falling. It fell. George knows.
UNK: I was in surgery for 14 hours yesterday and no tremor.
CHRISTINA : With me by your side, ready to jump in.
BURKE : I haven't had a tremor in a week.
CHRISTINA : George knows. And this is not any surgery.
CHRISTINA : - You are operating on his father today. - I am aware of that. And I am fine.
UNK: He will do something. He won't stand by and say nothing.
BURKE : There's nothing to say. I had a tremor. Now I don't.
CHRISTINA : We have to figure out our story and come up with a plan.
UNK: Cristina. You're too intense.
CHRISTINA : I am too intense?
CHRISTINA : I have been working my ass off. Making sure nobody here knows.
CHRISTINA : Running your board, learning surgical procedures, covering you.
BURKE : Covering me? And I haven't been covering you?
CHRISTINA : Excuse me?
BURKE : I'm just saying. We're a team.
MEREDITH : - OK. - A strong team.
UNK: I wouldn't be in that OR if I didn't know I could do it.
UNK: You have to trust me. Don't let this O'Malley thing break you down.
GEORGE : I'm not.
UNK: Cristina.
UNK: I got to go.
ALEX : What happened?
UNK: Driver lost control. Plowed through the fish market at the wharf.
UNK: At least a dozen injuries. I need all hands on deck.
UNK: Does that mean all hands? Or just all hands?
UNK: Stevens, you shouldn't have been paged.
BAILEY : You can go and take over on Mr. O'Malley.
