UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : I'm sorry, Janelle. I'm so, so sorry.
UNK: - It's OK, Mrs. D. I'm going to be OK. - All right.
BAILEY : Mrs. Dickerson, you should go back to your husband's room and wait there.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : He's having surgery too.
UNK: Everyone is having surgery.
UNK: Go on and take her up. The surgical team is waiting. Ma'am?
UNK: Mrs, Dickerson : What did I do? How could I have done this?
BAILEY : Done what? Done what?
UNK: I knew that he had trouble, my husband, with his feet.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : My daughter came to town. She took away his keys.
BAILEY : You gave them back to him.
UNK: If I had sided with my daughter, Larry would've felt so betrayed.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : He loves to drive.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : He didn't mean to hurt anyone.
UNK: Oh, God, I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
BAILEY : I'm so sorry.
BAILEY : - Listen, come with me. - What?
BAILEY : I know that you didn't mean to hurt anyone.
BAILEY : But we need to tell the police.
BAILEY : Just trust me.
BURKE : It entered the right ventricle and went right through the septum.
BURKE : I'm going to need to place a pericardial patch.
CHRISTINA : - Shall I do a running whip stitch? - I've got it.
UNK: I could do a McGoon. I've been practicing.
BURKE : Dr. Yang, move to the other side of the table.
CHRISTINA : Dr. Burke, I apologize...
BURKE : Move to the other side of the table. Thank you.
HAHN : Can I get some more lap pads?
UNK: - How's it going, Dr. Hahn? - Just groovy.
UNK: They're going to be so jealous back at Seattle Presbyterian.
DEREK : - Why is that? - Scrubbing in with Derek Shepherd?
UNK: The genius who saved Burke when he almost got his arm shot off?
HAHN : - Major jealousy. - Did you hear that? I'm a genius.
MEREDITH : - Of course you are. - No, she was serious.
HAHN : Damn it. I'm seeing a partial tear in his aorta.
UNK: You OK?
UNK: I have to enlarge the incision to get to the aorta.
UNK: We'll have to turn him on his back and redress.
DEREK : His pressure's bottomed out. Can you get control down there?
HAHN : He's crashing and this laceration's getting bigger.
DEREK : - You need help? - I need four hands.
HAHN : I need everyone in here to help me turn him.
DEREK : - Page Thompson. - He's out.
HAHN : - Burke available? - He's in OR 3.
UNK: - Run in and see if they can spare him. - I need everyone to help me turn him.
UNK: On your count. We got about a half an hour before this patient dies.
UNK: That is it. Start rewarming. Pledgeted 5-oh prolene.
UNK: It's going to take about ten minutes before the body warms up,
BURKE : then we'll take her off bypass.
CHRISTINA : - Nice work, Dr. Burke. - Thank you.
MEREDITH : Dr. Burke? Dr. Hahn was repairing the trachea and found an aortic transection.
