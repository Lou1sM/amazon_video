UNK: in my chest and my baby survives,
JANELLE : that's pretty much a sign I should have this baby, right? Even without a father?
ADDISON : - Everyone has a father. - Not if she doesn't tell him.
JANELLE : You think I should tell him. Everyone says I'm wrong.
JANELLE : He's scum and now I'm the bad guy
UNK: because I don't want him in my kid's life.
UNK: - That's what you're thinking? - Janelle.
ALEX : My thing is what about the kid?
ALEX : What happens when he's 6 or 7 and wants to meet his dad?
UNK: - This is none of your business, OK? - She asked, OK?
JANELLE : He cheated on me.
UNK: That makes him an ass. Doesn't mean you have to be one.
UNK: Ms. Duco?
UNK: BP's eighty over sixty.
UNK: JVD and muffled heart sounds. She's unstable. The OR can't wait.
UNK: Find Burke and bolus a liter of saline. Hang a unit of blood.
ADDISON : We've got to get her ready for transport. Now!
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : I'm sorry, spinal what?
MEREDITH : - Stenosis. - And he got this from the accident?
DEREK : It may have caused the accident.
DEREK : Spinal stenosis is common in older people.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : Larry didn't have anything wrong before the accident.
BAILEY : So there were no symptoms that either of you noticed?
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : No. Larry was fine.
UNK: We're old, but we've both been in good health. Larry was fine.
DEREK : We're going to need to operate.
UNK: He has a subdermal hematoma, bleeding in the brain.
DEREK : We need to bring in a cardiothoracic surgeon
DEREK : to repair the hole in his trachea, which is his windpipe.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : So that means that you need to operate on his chest and his head?
BURKE : Yes.
UNK: MRS. DICKERSON : We just wanted to go to the market.
UNK: It'll be OK. Whatever happens.
UNK: - Cristina. - He can't punish you.
UNK: Every surgery has been textbook and we haven't lost a patient.
UNK: - We've been flawless and he can't... - Cristina, you were right.
BURKE : The chief does want Dr. Hahn to replace me
UNK: as head of cardio-thoracic surgery.
BURKE : Richard's planning to retire.
UNK: And he's recommending that the board name me the next chief of surgery.
UNK: It's good, right? It means George didn't say anything.
BURKE : - I'm going to be chief. - You didn't tell him about your tremor.
BURKE : I'm going to be chief of surgery at Seattle Grace Hospital.
CHRISTINA : Why do you sound like that?
BURKE : Because I'm going to be chief of surgery at Seattle Grace Hospital.
UNK: This is what you've worked for. This is what you wanted.
UNK: And I can work harder. I can learn more procedures.
UNK: - I will do whatever you need. - What?
UNK: Right now, nobody knows.
UNK: The fact that George hasn't told the chief yet doesn't mean that he won't,
CHRISTINA : but we can deal with that. I'll talk to him... You talk to him.
CHRISTINA : Once you're chief, it won't matter. This is good. Nobody will ever know.
UNK: I'll know!
BURKE : I can't be chief. Not now. Not like this.
BURKE : Do you know how long I've wanted this?
BURKE : My entire career.
BURKE : And when I finally get it, there's blood on it.
BURKE : I had a tremor and I didn't say anything about it.
BURKE : It's unimaginable, it's unethical. Dishonorable. I've crossed the line.
UNK: We crossed the line. T ogether. I crossed the line with you.
UNK: You dragged me across the line!
BURKE : You made us a team. You told Shepherd I was fine.
UNK: You said nobody has to know. I was out there on my own. You made us a team.
CHRISTINA : I did what you needed me to do.
UNK: You were telling me your whole life was your hands.
CHRISTINA : - If you couldn't be Preston Burke... - Look, that was your concern, not mine!
CHRISTINA : No, you put that on me.
