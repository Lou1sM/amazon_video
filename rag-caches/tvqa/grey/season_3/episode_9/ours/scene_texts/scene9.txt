UNK: Patient's crashing. She really needs your help.
CHRISTINA : What are you doing?
UNK: The heart can't come off of bypass for a while yet. I'll be back.
CHRISTINA : - Shall I come? - No. Stay here.
UNK: Meredith! Is it bad? What does she need him to do?
MEREDITH : The guy's chest is a mess.
UNK: She's juggling tracheal and aortic injuries and needs a pair of hands.
CHRISTINA : - He just repaired a hole in her heart. - I'm sure he can handle it.
UNK: Cristina!
UNK: Hey, hey, hey! What do you think you're doing? Get back in there.
MEREDITH : What, do you think Burke can't operate without you?
UNK: - Oh, my God. Cristina. - Shut up.
MEREDITH : He can't operate without you.
CHRISTINA : If you ever gave a crap about me in any way,
CHRISTINA : you will shut your mouth and get back into that OR.
CHRISTINA : There's a beat. It's beating.
CHRISTINA : - She's ready to come off bypass, right? - She is.
UNK: Dr. Burke asked me to tell you he's going to be longer than he thought.
CHRISTINA : Longer than he thought? What else did he say?
CHRISTINA : She could stroke out if she stays on any longer. What did he say?
UNK: He said you shouldn't worry. He'll be right back.
UNK: Well, let's unclamp and see what we've got.
DEREK : Brain's not interesting enough, Dr. Grey?
UNK: We still got bleeding. I'll place a partial occluding clamp.
UNK: Four-oh prolene.
MEREDITH : - There. - Excellent, Burke. Thank you.
UNK: It should hold once you get a few more in there.
DEREK : Focus, Dr. Grey. Focus.
UNK: - Everything OK, Dr. Burke? - Everything's fine.
DEREK : Dr. Grey?
CHRISTINA : It's been too long. She needs to come off bypass.
NURSE : She should come off soon. How do you want to proceed?
CHRISTINA : I am not having this girl die of a stroke after all this. Page someone.
CHRISTINA : Anyone who can help take her off bypass.
CHRISTINA : - What happened in there? - He's going to live.
UNK: Dr. Burke, you were gone too long. She could stroke out any second.
BURKE : Gather yourself, Dr. Yang. Let's take her off bypass.
UNK: Good. Good rhythm. T emperature's up. OK, let's take her off bypass.
NURSE : Coming off bypass.
UNK: Start protamine.
UNK: Give me more volume.
