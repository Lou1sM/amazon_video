UNK: Ifyou'll let me take you to triage, I promise you I will find your son.
Carly : - He's so scared. - All right. I know.
UNK: - I'll find him. - OK.
Meredith : OK?
Vince : He's a mechanic. We work together.
Vince : We drive together to work and suddenly there's this huge jolt.
Friend : We were just trying to get out, but Rick went back.
UNK: He figured we could help, we should help.
Greg : He went back. There were people trapped.
Vince : We were right behind him.
UNK: Injuries to his chest and legs. His arm is broken,
UNK: and there's damage to his spine and pelvis. I can't...
Izzie : There's not much I can do until we get him out of here.
UNK: You got to do what you can.
Vince : I mean, we'll, uh... Greg, go find some more guys!
Izzie : Hey. Go find Search and Rescue, OK?
Izzie : Give them this. Tell them I said he can't wait.
Izzie : - He has to get to a hospital. - All right, I'm going.
Derek : He needs a CT. Keep his neck stable.
UNK: Ask for Waller. Waller's not available, ask for Krychek.
Derek : OK? Keep him stable. What do you got?
UNK: Nurse, let me have some bandages. Thank you. Stop here.
Addison : - Derek. - Hey. You got a free hand?
UNK: Hold this bandage for me, will you? You all right?
UNK: Yeah. It's just a lot.
UNK: Do you want to get married?
Derek : You haven't told me and I haven't asked.
Meredith : What? No, I don't want to get married. You want to get married?
Derek : No. Good.
Derek : - If that's not it, what is it? - It isn't anything.
UNK: Are you good? I got to get this kid to triage.
Derek : - Is she all right? - Yeah, she's good. She's just lost.
UNK: Hang in there. We're going to get you to the hospital soon.
UNK: Liar]
UNK: All non-emergent surgeries have been postponed.
Derek : - Good. - I'm going to go check on discharges.
UNK: I'm trying to free up as many beds as I can on the surgical wing.
UNK: - Oh, I was going to do that, but... - I can do it.
Richard : Uh... Sure. Good.
Addison : - Unless you want to. - No. No, go ahead.
Addison : - You're still the chief. - I know that.
UNK: - It just seems so quiet, you know? - Yeah.
Richard : We're expecting the first wave from the scene soon.
Addison : I dyed my hair blond.
Addison : The day after Derek moved out.
Addison : Change is good. Your marriage is over.
UNK: You're... you're starting over.
Addison : So am I.
Callie : Right.
Cristina : I specifically told you I needed to tell Meredith first.
Burke : I was talking to Shepherd and it just came out.
UNK: - It's no big deal. - Wait, it is a big deal.
UNK: She's not even going to care about the fact I'm getting married.
Cristina : She's gonna care that I didn't tell her myself.
Burke : And why didn't you?
Cristina : There was a major disaster.
Burke : That was 45 minutes after we discussed it.
Burke : You were with your friends for 45 minutes running triage drills,
Burke : and you weren't compelled to mention it?
Cristina : The chief says they're rolling in soon, so...
UNK: Her pressure's low. I don't see any good veins for an IV.
UNK: She's clamped down from hypothermia.
UNK: I've never seen a crushed injury so bad and survive. God, she's a mess.
Alex : She needs to stay on her left side. We got to move her on her left.
UNK: It's going to take both of us. Got to get that BP up. On my count.
Paramedic : One... two...
UNK: Your baby. Your baby's OK. For now, it looks OK.
UNK: Just try to breathe.
UNK: We need to move you to help with your circulation, OK?
UNK: One... two... three.
