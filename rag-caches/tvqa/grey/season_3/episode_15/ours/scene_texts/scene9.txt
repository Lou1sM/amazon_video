Burke : - What do we got? - We just got started.
UNK: All right. But I got this.
Burke : There's nobody covering my service.
Burke : Get up to telemetry and check on my patients, pre-op and post-op.
Cristina : Then I should join you in surgery?
Burke : No, and then you should report to the pit.
Cristina : - The chief assigned me to Jane Doe. - Yes. And now I'm reassigning you.
Cristina : To do what? Sutures?
Bailey : Yes.
Cristina : OK, so you're saying you don't want me to scrub in?
UNK: Dr. Yang, I'm saying that I have an unattended cardiothoracic wing,
Burke : and a pit full of patients that you have the ability to help.
Burke : I don't need you in the OR, I need you on the floor.
Burke : Do you have a problem with that?
MVO : No.
Cristina : Thank you.
UNK: No, not... Chris Heit.
George : He's seven. He's got brown hair.
UNK: I don't know if he's injured. I'm...
UNK: Could you at least check to see if he's there?
George : I know all the families were directed here. Could you just check?
UNK: Thank you. Yeah. Callie?
George : - I need some help. - I can't. I'm busy.
UNK: OK. It's just I'm trying to find this...
Callie : I'm busy. I'm about to go into surgery.
UNK: - I can't be your wife now. I'm working. - I am too.
George : - I have a patient who needs surgery. - So do I.
George : Yes. Any luck?
Cristina : Thank you.
UNK: OK. Damn it!
Meredith : Can I get some help over here?
UNK: Sweetie? Listen to me. I need you to turn around.
Meredith : I told you to face away from me, but we have to work together to help this man.
Meredith : I don't talk either when I get scared.
UNK: I don't... talk when bad things happen.
Meredith : You don't have to say anything.
Meredith : But I need your help.
Meredith : OK. Don't look down. Don't look at the blood. Look at me.
Meredith : Look at me. Can you be my assistant?
Meredith : OK, good.
UNK: I can't move my hands right now, so I need you to go over to my kit
Meredith : and pull out the things... They look like, um, tweezers.
Meredith : You know what your mommy uses to pull a splinter out with?
Cristina : Hey. What was the site like? Was it gory?
Cristina : Was it trauma bonanza?
UNK: I mean, obviously terrible.
Alex : - I don't talk to thieves. - What?
UNK: You stole my Jane Doe out from under me.
Cristina : I am not a thief. You balked.
Cristina : - You're a balker. - I was thinking.
Cristina : Not my problem that thinking is time-consuming for you.
Alex : I rescued her. I climbed down, I pulled a massive pylon off of her.
Alex : - I got her here alive. - Pylons? There were pylons on people?
Alex : Now I get stuck baby-sitting the patients' families
UNK: - while you get to scrub in. - Well, I'm not scrubbing in.
Cristina : - I'm stitching up patients in the pit. - Ah. Who'd you piss off to get that?
Cristina : I happen to be pulling gaping pieces of flesh back together.
UNK: Mmm. You're stitching.
UNK: You're one step closer to knitting your grandma a sweater.
UNK: - At least mine's medical. - Knitting. I pull pylons off people.
Sydney : Orange juice? Orange juice?
Sydney : Orange juice? Oh, sweetie.
UNK: Yeah, his color's not good. Do you want some orange juice?
Sydney : Maybe I have some wheat crackers.
Derek : - Yeah. - No?
Sydney : Everybody, if you're waiting to hear about your families,
Sydney : we should be hearing something very soon. I'm sorry.
UNK: He must've saved at least a dozen people who were stuck.
Friend : - We told him not to go back. - That's the kind of guy he is.
Vince : He's the guy that goes back.
Vince : - He's got kids, too. Five of them. - OK, I'm committed to the project.
Izzie : I don't need to hear about the kids.
Rick : - Leave the girl alone, Vince. - Sorry.
UNK: You're doing a real great job, doc.
Greg : - How's he doing? - He's doing all right.
UNK: No! No, he's not!
Izzie : I can't do anything until we get him out.
UNK: Why have you come back by yourself?
UNK: Search and Rescue said they'd come when they can.
Izzie : - Did you show them the red tag? - They said they got 15 red tags.
