UNK: Pulse is better. I'll attempt IV access again.
Alex : Breathe through the pain.
UNK: What you can do for your baby right now is take care of yourself. Good girl.
Alex : I know it hurts. Come on, now. Keep breathing for me, OK?
Alex : That's it.
Alex : Keep breathing.
Derek : Good.
UNK: What do we...?
Cristina : - So, what do we do? - We wait.
Cristina : - We wait? - We wait.
Meredith : OK, we need to find a grown-up.
Meredith : Another grown-up to help you find your mom.
UNK: Come on! Come on! Let's go.
UNK: Hey. Uh, I need you to take this little girl to the triage tents.
UNK: - I got to get to my unit. - No.
Meredith : I need you to take this little girl to the triage tents for me. Please.
UNK: You're going to be OK. You're going to be fine. I promise.
Sydney : Thanks.
UNK: - Help! I need some help over here! - Stay right here.
Derek : How we doing?
UNK: Bad, but a lot of survivors, that's something.
Meredith : - It is. - Have you seen Stevens?
MVO : - No. - What about O'Malley? Grey?
UNK: I saw Grey ten minutes ago. She was on her way over here.
Derek : - You haven't seen her? - No.
UNK: I got to head out with this one, so keep an eye out for my interns, all right?
Derek : I'll do my best.
Alex : Six months pregnant, found under a pile of rubble.
Alex : Crush injuries to her right torso as well as trauma to the face.
UNK: BP initially low, but up to 90/60 after a liter of fluid
Alex : - and placing her on her left side. - What do we do? Karev?
Cristina : ABC.
Cristina : Her airway needs to be protected, her breathing will be compromised.
UNK: We need blood available. I would do a trauma panel,
Cristina : type and cross, CTs of the head and neck.
UNK: Excellent. Let's get her started. Trauma room two.
Paramedic : One, two and three.
UNK: Let's see what we have here.
UNK: The baby is going to...
UNK: Make sure you shield her in radiology.
Burke : Get her stabilized before worrying about the baby.
UNK: - The amount of rads are negligible. - But she's going to need a lot,
UNK: - and we need to protect them both. - Yang, you're on this.
Richard : Alex, go to the clinic.
UNK: - The victims' families need answers. - I pulled her out of the damn water.
Richard : Which is heroic and manly. You need to talk to those families.
Alex : - Why can't Yang do it? - This is all hands on deck.
Richard : Yang can handle this. Now go.
