Meredith : I was taking a bath.
Derek : - That's not a bath. - Drop it!
Derek : - Your mother... - Drop it!
UNK: Your mother... Look, your mother was lucid and she said things.
Derek : - Now she's... - Gone.
Meredith : Everything's back to normal. It's not a big deal.
Derek : Except she's having heart surgery today. Do you want to talk to the chief?
UNK: You have the triage thing, but he'll give you the day off.
UNK: Stop. I do not need rescuing.
Derek : You would have drowned in the bathtub had I not been there.
Meredith : I'm a surgeon. I do the rescuing.
Meredith : You are not my knight in shining whatever.
Derek : We're gonna fight 'cause I pulled you out of the tub?
UNK: You have a place you can sleep at.
Meredith : Then you don't have to pull me out of the tub.
Meredith : - You're everywhere. - This is the happy ever after part.
Derek : In the happily ever after part, the guy is there all the time
Derek : - and the girls love it. - Go to work. I'll see you there.
UNK: Just for the record? I am your knight in shining whatever.
Derek : Morning.
Meredith : I did not try to drown myself in the bathtub.
Izzie : Hey, I ate everything out of the fridge last night.
Izzie : Everything. Including a tub of butter.
Izzie : There's no judgment here.
UNK: - You ever feel you're disappearing? - All the time.
Meredith : Why can't I just be that happily ever after person?
Meredith : Why can't I believe in that?
Izzie : I don't know what I believe in anymore.
UNK: - We're not telling people. - I haven't.
UNK: - I know. I know. Just don't. - I'm not going to. Yet.
UNK: I just... I need to tell my friends here first.
Burke : I have friends here.
Burke : - Shepherd. - No, you can't tell Shepherd.
Cristina : You cannot tell Shepherd until I've told Meredith. It will be a thing.
Burke : You act like this is a disaster. The world won't implode if people know.
UNK: I will tell them. Today. Just... wait.
Derek : - Morning. - Good morning.
Derek : - Morning. - Morning.
Derek : What's different?
Richard : - Nothing. - Leave him be.
Derek : - What happened to your hair? - Nothing.
UNK: Mm-hmm.
UNK: See? Look. Watch.
Derek : - What happened to your hair? - Ahem. Leave him be.
UNK: - He dyed it. - But why?
Derek : - Ow! - Leave him be.
Derek : - What are you doing? - What?
Burke : OK, but why?
Richard : Men who have gray hair are noticed less than men who don't.
Derek : By who?
Richard : - Well... - By the ladies?
UNK: - It looks good, chief. - Very natural.
Burke : Ladies will love it.
Addison : He is alone. All alone.
UNK: Do any of you know what that's like?
UNK: Lives with Cristina, dates the perfect 12-year-old, man-whore!
Addison : His wife left him after 25 years of marriage.
Addison : So if the man wants to dye his hair for the ladies,
UNK: let him dye his hair for the ladies. Leave him be.
Callie : It's weird. Weird. It's weird, right?
Bailey : I need more triage tear tags.
Callie : Working with somebody I'm married to is weird.
Callie : I mean, I'm his boss and his wife.
Callie : At work, I'm giving him orders. In bed, he's giving me...
UNK: Stop there! I don't need to know this. I'm tired, I'm busy.
UNK: While I concede you and O'Malley have some challenges to overcome,
Bailey : I'm asking you to remember that this day is a marathon,
Bailey : and my mind can only hold what it needs.
UNK: Your sex life cannot be held in my mind today. Ever.
Bailey : It cannot be held in my mind ever.
Meredith : - Whatever. - Sydney Heron here to lend a hand.
Sydney : Hey! Hi! Hello! Miranda. Hey, nice clinic. Very nice.
