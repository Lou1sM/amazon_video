UNK: Oh, she... OK, she's cute, acting like she didn't know about it.
Bailey : - I'm not cute. - I'm on to you, OK? I'm a competitor.
Sydney : - Grr! - I bite.
UNK: Oh! Well, I'll just wait for you in the pit.
Derek : - What? - Nothing.
Derek : - What? - OK, cranky. Forget it.
UNK: Am I the only one who thinks the triage test is a waste of time?
UNK: There's a platysmaplasty on the board.
Izzie : - George, hey. - Hey.
Izzie : - How's it going? - Good.
Izzie : - You like living in a hotel? - Yeah. It's good.
UNK: Because your room's still there. Next to mine.
UNK: - Oh, Izzie... - I'm just saying,
UNK: if you don't like the hotel, you can always just move right back in.
George : You think I'm this boy that you need to save.
UNK: I get that, and it would be sweet if it weren't so condescending.
Alex : Is it too much to ask to be performing actual surgeries?
Alex : We are actual surgeons.
Derek : - What? - Nothing.
Izzie : A lot of arm swelling, but good distal pulses
UNK: so we can rule out compartment syndrome.
Izzie : I suspect a radius fracture so I'd splint and get an ortho follow-up.
Bailey : Anything else?
MVO : - No. - OK. Then I guess this means...
Meredith : - Time. - And I'm dead!
Cop : Dead?
Bailey : You sent her home. The bone punctured her skin.
UNK: She had multiple wounds and abrasions.
Sydney : A puncture over a break is an open fracture until proven otherwise.
UNK: - I got septic and died, thanks to you. - Whatever.
UNK: Not "whatever" to dead "minor puncture wound that's not" guy.
Bailey : Be quick and thorough while using your instincts.
UNK: You can't be fooled by your eyes.
Bailey : If you assess wrong, your patient could die.
Bailey : Karev. You're next.
Izzie : I already killed her. You can't do more damage than that.
Bailey : People. Triage is one of the most important tools a doctor has.
Bailey : In a real emergent scenario, you'll have only minutes...
Callie : And it's something you'll be tested on in your surgicals.
George : - Sorry. - George.
UNK: I'm just recording the drill. Yeah.
UNK: All right. We're working, George. I'm your boss right now. All right?
UNK: - Yes. A very sexy one. - You cannot undermine my authority
UNK: in front of the interns, in front of my peers.
Bailey : O'Malley, take that back to the clinic where it belongs.
George : - Sorry. - People. Look, I'm sorry.
Richard : I have to interrupt the session.
Sydney : Chief, I like your new hair. It really brings out your eyes.
Bailey : Do you need something, sir?
UNK: We received word of a mass casualty incident.
UNK: All trauma centers have been asked to respond.
UNK: - I need to send a team immediately. - This part of the exercise?
Cristina : Are we supposed to act appropriately, uh, tense?
Richard : This is not an exercise or a drill, Yang.
Richard : This is an emergent situation. I need all hands on deck.
Bailey : - What happened? - I don't have details, just orders.
