UNK: Come on, guys. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
UNK: No, don't do this, man. Stay with me!
Bailey : - What happened? - He let go of my hand! He's gone limp!
UNK: Rick! Wake up, Rick!
UNK: Hey. I'm not going to be able to make it to your surgery.
Alex : Here's the thing.
UNK: You were crushed underneath a cement pylon.
Alex : Dozens of people on that ferry boat died.
Alex : But you're still alive. So when I come to check on you after the surgery,
UNK: you'd better still be alive. All right? You hear me?
Callie : All right.
Addison : BP's stable. So is the baby's.
Addison : You did good, Karev.
UNK: Is she going to be OK?
UNK: Yeah, we're going to...
UNK: - We're going to do everything we can. - What about the baby?
UNK: Is she going to be able to carry it to term?
MVO : Um...
Addison : You should get back down to the clinic.
UNK: Mrs. Heit, it's time.
UNK: We need to operate before you lose any more blood,
Bailey : or your bowels start to die.
UNK: Just wait until Dr. O'Malley finds my son. Please.
UNK: Dr. O'Malley?
UNK: George? Did you find him?
Carly : Is he OK? Is he awake?
Izzie : One of his pupils is blown. We don't have time.
UNK: What're you going to do? You can't let him die.
UNK: - Sorry! I'm doing what I can! - It's not enough!
UNK: Please!
UNK: They're not going to get him out soon.
Vince : Figure out a way to help him. Right here. Right now.
UNK: I don't understand.
UNK: - I haven't been able to find her yet. - Finally!
UNK: - Kelly Winter! - Fatima is a little girl...
UNK: Hold on! Hold on! I'm Dr. Karev.
UNK: This is a very rough situation,
UNK: and I can assure you we're doing everything we can.
UNK: The following are the patients we have identified at this time.
UNK: John J. Anders, Kirk Demorast...
UNK: Angry Lady : This is the same list they gave us a half hour ago. It's posted over there.
Alex : - I understand. - Please, just Kelly?
UNK: She's got brown hair. She's about five-four.
Alex : We had a lot of people who came in without ID.
UNK: Take us to the ER and we'll look for ourselves.
Alex : - We can't let you do that. - Why not?
UNK: Those are our kids in there!
Derek : OK.
UNK: Now, I have to deflate the blood pressure cuff and see if he bleeds.
Meredith : OK. We saved him. You helped.
Meredith : We just have to bandage him up.
UNK: We're going to find someone to take him to the hospital, then find your mom.
UNK: I can't stand it! The pain!
UNK: - I got to get out of here! - You can't move, sir! Don't move!
