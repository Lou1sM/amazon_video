UNK: Everybody loves a scandal.
UNK: So you think it's just gossip? Not actual concern about me as a doctor?
BURKE : Sure. Sure.
MEREDITH : Because...
UNK: It was stupid. I know better.
UNK: When I'm studying for the Bar, I'm a mess.
UNK: Can't focus on anything but torts and real property, constitutional law.
MEREDITH : - The biosynthetic ones. - We never use those.
MEREDITH : We do now. Sloan changed the burn protocol last week.
GRETCHEN : I was about to start a practice test. I wanted some tea.
GRETCHEN : So I put on a pot of water and hit the timer, and just forgot.
GRETCHEN : Half an hour into my section on contracts
GRETCHEN : and the smoke alarm was blaring and, well, you know the rest.
MEREDITH : - You're going to be a lawyer? - I have to pass the Bar exam.
UNK: I failed before. But this time I'm ready. I'm going to pass.
IZZIE : Good for you.
DEREK : That was just mean.
UNK: Kathleen told me to find out why the intern's panties
UNK: were on the bulletin board.
DEREK : Four sisters and not one brother. And you wonder why I don't call.
UNK: Feel free to explain the panties anytime.
UNK: It's great to see you. Great to have you here.
DEREK : But I have a job. I have patients.
UNK: I have a mother at 35 weeks with twins. Where is her OB?
DEREK : Her OB should be on a plane back to Connecticut.
UNK: We've covered the trailer. We need the slutty intern and the divorce.
DEREK : You know what? You sound more and more like Mom every day.
NANCY : Take it back.
GEORGE : So two uteruses. That's pretty cool.
UNK: - And you're engaged. That's also cool. - Greg talked me into it.
UNK: Oh, man. From the first moment I saw Noelle, I was ham.
UNK: - Did you say "ham"? - You're either ham or eggs.
NOELLE : - Here we go. - You got to ask yourself :
UNK: Are you the chicken or are you the pig?
UNK: I'm sorry. Pig or chicken?
UNK: You got a plate of ham and eggs, right? Now the chicken is involved in the meal.
GREG : But the pig is committed. So the question is,
UNK: are you involved or are you committed?
GREG : - Ham or eggs. - Yeah. Ham or eggs.
MARK : - Karev, you free? - Absolutely, sir.
MARK : Great. Take this. I'm on hold with the DMV.
UNK: A mix up about switching my license and registration to Seattle.
UNK: - Take care of that for me? - Thanks for thinking of me, sir.
UNK: O'Malley. How's it feel to be the new gynie grunt?
UNK: Oh. I got a patient who is born with and is pregnant in two uteruses.
UNK: Two uteruses. Jealous?
UNK: No. I'm busy. I'm on hold.
ALEX : - Important business. - Right.
ALEX : - For Sloan. - Right. It's super important, I'm sure.
UNK: Noelle Labatt. Room 2314.
ALEX : Hang on. Can I see that? For a second?
NANCY : Did I just hear him say two uteruses?
UNK: - I'm sorry. You must be...? - Nancy-pants?
NANCY : Hey, loser.
MARK : I wish Derek had told me you were coming to visit.
NANCY : - Like he tells you anything these days? - I'm working on that.
DEREK : What are you doing here? Trying to torture him?
MARK : He's my family, Nancy. Plus I needed a change of pace.
