NOELLE : What happened? Are my babies OK?
UNK: The surgery went well.
UNK: You have a healthy boy and the labor stopped on your girl,
UNK: - and she's going to be just fine. - And Greg? Has Greg come back yet?
ADDISON : No, Noelle. I'm sorry. Greg isn't here.
UNK: I want an update every half hour and...
NOELLE : What happened? My babies?
UNK: Are just fine. You're coming out of anesthesia, Noelle.
UNK: Everything went very well.
NOELLE : Is Greg back yet?
UNK: I'm so sorry, Noelle. He's not here.
ADDISON : Be sure to alert me to any fetal distress.
NOELLE : - What happened? - Your babies are healthy.
UNK: - Everything's OK. - Is Greg back yet?
UNK: GREG at the door : I'm right here.
CHRISTINA : Hi.
GREG : I... I saw our son.
GREG : He's amazing.
GREG : But how's our little girl?
MARK : You look like you could use a little cheering up.
CALLIE : Not from you.
MARK : If I recall, I was pretty good at cheering you up.
MARK : One, two, yep. Three very cheerful times.
CALLIE : Dirty. It was not cheerful, it was dirty. And like I said, no.
MEREDITH : So your sister really doesn't like me.
DEREK : Sorry. It's just she's... from the East Coast.
NANCY : - Well, I... - I, you know, I should've called.
BURKE : But you didn't.
DEREK : I want us to work. It's just... it's complicated.
DEREK : - I think I need a little time to... - Take some space.
DEREK : Yeah. To clear my head.
UNK: Yeah. OK. OK.
CHRISTINA : OK.
MEREDITH : There are times when even the best of us
MEREDITH : have trouble with commitment.
UNK: Dr. Stevens.
UNK: I was looking at Dr. Grey's evaluation on your first day back.
UNK: - I get daily report cards now? - She had a lot to say.
UNK: Yes, sir.
UNK: It was a difficult catch. Nicely handled. Good work.
UNK: Welcome back, Dr. Stevens.
UNK: I was rude to you before. I'm sorry.
UNK: I understand what you were trying to say. You're the... pig.
UNK: You are committed.
UNK: Only we broke up.
UNK: I've been wanting to hear this from you for how long?
UNK: And you wait until now to say it to me, after we've broken up?
UNK: I'm out of my element here. I break bones for a living.
UNK: I used to live in the basement. Most days, I wear last night's eyeliner.
UNK: I don't care what people think about me
UNK: because I am a happily independent, successful woman and I like it that way.
UNK: Only when you say stuff like this...
UNK: It just, it makes things too hard, so please don't chase me anymore.
UNK: Unless you're ready to catch me.
MEREDITH : And we may be surprised by the commitments
UNK: we are willing to let slip out of our grasp.
MEREDITH : commitments are complicated.
UNK: I'm here for you. Whatever it is.
UNK: Whenever you're ready, I'm here.
BURKE : Thank you.
MEREDITH : We may surprise ourselves
MEREDITH : by the commitments we're willing to make.
MEREDITH : True commitment takes effort.
MEREDITH : And sacrifice.
MEREDITH : Which is why, sometimes...
MEREDITH : ...we have to learn the hard way.
MEREDITH : To choose our commitments very carefully.
