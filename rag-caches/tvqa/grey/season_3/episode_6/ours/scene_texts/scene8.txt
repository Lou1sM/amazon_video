GRETCHEN : It's all I'm known for. "Oh, Gretchen the failure. "
GRETCHEN : Can you imagine failing the Bar exam five times? Five times.
UNK: I mean that's absurd. I mean... That's just...
GRETCHEN : That's pathetic.
UNK: I cannot sit for two and a half solid days of testing again
GRETCHEN : just to prove to everyone, again,
GRETCHEN : how pathetic I am.
UNK: Not when I...
IZZIE : You feel that pathetic all by yourself.
ADDISON : I've completed the incision and I'm going to ask you to move
ADDISON : the top uterus to the side so I can reach the one underneath.
CHRISTINA : Got it.
UNK: Now, I don't want to alarm you or make you nervous in any way, O'Malley,
UNK: because you seem like a decent person, but I've got about 120 seconds to get
UNK: Baby One out of Uterus One while you're holding Uterus Two.
ADDISON : And if you so much as hiccup,
UNK: you could tear the uterine wall and kill this woman's child,
UNK: so, do what you can to be careful, OK?
CHRISTINA : OK.
NURSE : - Wow. Look at that. - Amazing, huh?
UNK: Applying the final hemostasis suture.
UNK: - Great. Don't be afraid to... - Grab a bigger piece? Got it.
UNK: Good. Very nice, Dr. Yang.
CHRISTINA : - Applying pressure. - Gently.
UNK: It was attached to the interventricular septum.
CHRISTINA : - Going to use a graft to repair? - Somebody's been doing their homework.
UNK: Four-oh prolene, please. Thank you very much.
UNK: Ready to perforate Uterus Two. Scalpel?
UNK: Wait. My baby's moving. It's really moving. I can't hold it.
ADDISON : I need you to hold her still if I'm going to do this.
GEORGE : - I'm trying. - I mean it. O'Malley!
GEORGE : What should I do? I can't hold it.
NURSE : You're sending her into distress. You need that baby to stop moving.
GEORGE : - How do I do that? - Talk.
UNK: - Alex! - Karev, back away from the table.
ALEX : Talk to it. To the baby. To calm it down.
GEORGE : Talk about what?
ALEX : October 30, 1974. It's the fight known as Rumble in the Jungle.
UNK: World champ George Foreman is pitted against Muhammad Ali.
UNK: - His first major fight in three years. - It's working.
UNK: Foreman is favored to win. He's younger, he's stronger...
MEREDITH : - Scalpel. - But he's not prepared for rope-a-dope.
ALEX : In the second round, Foreman comes out swinging.
ALEX : Ali's backed up against the ropes.
DEREK : That's not going to stay. You're giving it too much slack.
CHIEF : You're blocking my light.
UNK: You need to think of it as a basic corner stitch.
CHIEF : I can figure out how to sew on my own buttons. I am a surgeon.
ADDISON : All right.
UNK: Oh, for God sakes.
UNK: You sew this and I'll get rid of Addison and Sloan.
DEREK : - Really? - No.
UNK: Oh. Fine, I'll do it anyway.
CHIEF : I heard you've got a sister wandering the halls.
UNK: - She planning on moving here too? - I hope not.
UNK: I know it's been hard on you.
DEREK : He was like my brother. I had four sisters.
