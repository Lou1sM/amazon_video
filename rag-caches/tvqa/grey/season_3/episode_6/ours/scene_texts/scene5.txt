UNK: Give her a gram of cefazolin and a tetanus.
GRETCHEN : It's too bad, really. That I did this to my hand.
UNK: - I was going to take the Bar Friday. - This burn is bad,
MARK : but we'll get you fixed up.
MARK : You'll be fine to take the test on Friday.
GRETCHEN : I will?
UNK: She's Iying. Something's off about Gretchen's story.
MEREDITH : You're only supposed to be observing.
UNK: I am observing, closely, and I'm telling you something is off.
IZZIE : Did you see her reaction when Sloan said she'd be OK for the test?
IZZIE : That was not relief. That was panic.
UNK: It's OK to be nervous about being back here at work. About failing.
UNK: You haven't even been back a full day and you're pushing to bend the rules.
UNK: This is so not about me. This is about our patient.
UNK: I am worried about our patient. Get off your high horse.
MEREDITH : This is my patient. Try to remember that.
IZZIE : - Fine. Whatever. - Iz.
UNK: A Humpty Dumpty surgery? Burke's doing a Humpty Dumpty today?
UNK: Um... Yes.
UNK: I've never seen a Humpty firsthand before.
CHRISTINA : Me neither.
CHRISTINA : - What are you doing? - Scrubbing in. You'll let Burke know?
CHRISTINA : Sure.
GEORGE : I know you're not talking to me, but I have something to explain.
GEORGE : All you have to do is listen.
UNK: You and me? We're like ham and eggs.
GEORGE : I was the chicken. I know that I was the chicken.
GEORGE : You put yourself out there and were committed.
UNK: I was just putting the eggs, not the ham because you're the pig.
UNK: I was involved, but now? I'm committed.
UNK: - Did you call me a pig? - It's a metaphor.
UNK: Calling me a pig?
UNK: The point is you're not the pig anymore. I'm the pig.
UNK: Now I am the pig.
GEORGE : I am the pig.
IZZIE : I've been waiting for half an hour in the cafeteria.
IZZIE : Since when do we eat in a patient room?
GEORGE : Izzie, meet Really Old Guy. We found him a couple of days ago.
GEORGE : He sleeps all the time.
UNK: It's quiet in here. Nobody bothers us.
UNK: No. What are you doing?
UNK: It turns out I'm not doing anything. I'm literally not allowed to.
UNK: I knew coming back was going to be an adjustment...
UNK: - What are you doing right now? - Eating.
CHRISTINA : If you want to socialize or get in a quick therapy session,
CHRISTINA : go do it over there.
IZZIE : - Seriously? - Goodbye, Izzie.
UNK: OK. Fine.
UNK: O'Malley, your chick with the two uteruses?
GEORGE : You're on scut. Glorified plastics scut.
UNK: You are in no position to mock me or my uteruses.
UNK: - Any cervical changes? - Why do you care?
CHIEF : - I don't. - I'm so glad to be back.
UNK: Yay. Not complaining about you.
IZZIE : You and I are fine, boss.
UNK: - This is weird. - I called Callie a pig.
ALEX : To her face?
MEREDITH : What happened to "she's a corpse"?
IZZIE : I can't get over how much everything has changed.
MEREDITH : - How many times? - Just one.
MEREDITH : - I get one too. - Deal.
NANCY : - Gin. - Wha...?
UNK: - What was with that? With Meredith? - We have a thing.
IZZIE : You have a thing with Meredith and I don't know about it?
IZZIE : - I live with you. - It's a work thing.
UNK: The whole point of hanging out with Really Old Guy is he doesn't talk.
CHRISTINA : The man is sedated. This is supposed to be a quiet place.
UNK: See? Changed. She's changed. Everything's changed.
UNK: MRS. BYRD : I gave the other nurse a list of his medications this morning.
UNK: My husband needs his pills! He needed them hours ago!
UNK: Why don't you check on the meds again?
NURSE : - I have checked on them. - Meds. Pharmacy. Now. Sorry.
UNK: - I'm sorry. I am sorry. - It's fine. It's fine.
UNK: MRS. BYRD : I was never a yeller before.
UNK: I'm becoming this horrible person who yells at people
