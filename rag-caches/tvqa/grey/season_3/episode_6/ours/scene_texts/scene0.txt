BAILEY : - Denny. - Are there any questions for me?
UNK: I got shot. I'm not fine. You're not fine.
UNK: You quit being a surgeon.
UNK: You stand on my right side. I'll look at you
UNK: and you'll do the sutures we've practiced.
UNK: Nobody has to know.
MEREDITH : To make it, really make it,
MEREDITH : as a surgeon,
MEREDITH : it takes major commitment.
MEREDITH : We have to be willing to pick up that scalpel...
UNK: ...and make a cut that may or may not do more damage than good.
MEREDITH : It's all about being committed.
UNK: Because if we're not...
MEREDITH : ...we have no business picking up that scalpel in the first place.
UNK: Put Burke in OR 2 tomorrow at 1 Oam, the usual scrub team.
CHRISTINA : And get rid of his valve replacement at 2. That's no good.
UNK: Yang, brought you a latte.
CHRISTINA : - You're not scrubbing in. - But Burke always lets me scrub in.
UNK: - Hey, Yang. Can I get in on Burke's...? - No. OK? No residents.
UNK: Burke says you crowd him. So just go away.
CHRISTINA : Make sure you put the instrument tray on his left-hand side.
UNK: He needs the extra elbow room.
CHRISTINA : OR 2, no gallery. Burke was specific.
UNK: Dr. Burke's become very specific since coming back to work.
CHRISTINA : Do you want me to tell him you said that?
UNK: Burke's back and Cristina runs his board? Does she think she's Bailey?
MEREDITH : She's helping him.
UNK: Bull. She's taking advantage. She gets out of rounds,
UNK: scrubs in for Burke's surgeries, orders residents.
UNK: You guys are overreacting.
UNK: Sorry. It's completely illegible.
UNK: She's writing on the OR board.
ALEX : Maybe I should sleep with Burke.
MEREDITH : You've been busy.
CHRISTINA : Yeah.
UNK: Derek hasn't called yet.
MEREDITH : I told him I broke up with Finn a week ago.
MEREDITH : Still hasn't called. Hey, do you want to go grab a drink? Catch up?
CHRISTINA : I can't. I have to study up for Burke's surgeries tomorrow.
MEREDITH : She's busy.
GEORGE : Callie.
UNK: OTHER INTERN : Hey.
GEORGE : Talk to me.
GEORGE : How about talking to me instead of ignoring me? Callie?
CALLIE : George!
GEORGE : That's talking. It's a good start.
UNK: - Oh, God! - Hey, stranger.
DEREK : Nancy. You don't call first?
UNK: Hi. You know, I...
DEREK : Meredith.
UNK: Meredith. Wait. Let me explain. Meredith.
NANCY : I take it that was the slutty intern you cheated on Addison with.
DEREK : She's not slutty. What are you doing here?
UNK: You bailed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, live in a trailer, getting a divorce.
NANCY : - There's the slutty intern. - I don't like you.
NANCY : You love me.
UNK: Feeling good. Really good.
MEREDITH : - Good. - Good.
UNK: Yeah, first day back.
UNK: It's big. Kind of nervous. But feeling good. Do I look OK?
UNK: MEREDITH and GEORGE : - Great. - Great.
UNK: I want to get off on the right foot. Gotta get my ID renewed, new time card,
