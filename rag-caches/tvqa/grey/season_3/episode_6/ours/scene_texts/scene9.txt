DEREK : Four very annoying sisters.
DEREK : Mark was my brother. It's hard.
CHIEF : Divorce isn't all it's cracked up to be, huh?
DEREK : I just want it to be easy.
UNK: I want it to be over and move on. But...
CHIEF : You're in a surprising amount of pain.
DEREK : You and Adele?
CHIEF : I'm sewing on a button for the first time in my life.
CHIEF : What does that tell you?
DEREK : Technically, I'm sewing.
DEREK : I'm just saying.
UNK: Radiologist, contact 5310.
ALEX : Dr. Sloan.
MARK : So we're clear, you knew when you stepped into that surgery
UNK: you forfeited your future in plastics.
ALEX : - But, Dr. Sloan... - I need my phone back.
UNK: - Well done. You were really prepared. - Yes. I'm always prepared.
UNK: - Couldn't do it without you. - Thank you.
BAILEY : Dr. Burke, could we have a moment alone?
BAILEY : I didn't realize that you were one of them.
UNK: One of the doctors around here with doubts about me or my abilities.
BURKE : Miranda, I'm not.
BAILEY : My name was erased from the board. I have to assume that was you.
MEREDITH : - Dr. Bailey... - I just... I just need to know why.
BAILEY : I need you to tell me why you didn't want me in on your surgery.
BURKE : I'm afraid I just couldn't use you.
BAILEY : I understand.
UNK: Oh, you should've seen that. Two uteruses.
UNK: So unbelievably cool. And a cute baby to boot.
DEREK : - I'm glad you're enjoying your trip. - Relax. I'm on a plane in two hours.
UNK: So you going to report back to Mom that...
NANCY : That you're you.
UNK: Still running in circles around all the women in your life,
NANCY : but that's to be expected with four sisters and a dead dad.
UNK: I'm not running around in circles.
NANCY : Can you even remember the last time you were alone?
UNK: You've never been single, ever. You're fine, but you're not happy.
NANCY : And you're not going to get happy until you get some space.
UNK: Just get away from Addie, away from the intern. Just away.
UNK: Figure out what you want.
DEREK : Kathleen's the shrink, Nancy. Not you.
NANCY : I gotta go.
DEREK : Nancy.
DEREK : Thanks for flying out here.
UNK: It was, uh...
NANCY : Thanks.
UNK: - Where are we going again? - We need to go upstairs.
CHRISTINA : OK.
UNK: Wait. Wait!
GRETCHEN : Where are we?
UNK: We're on the psychiatric floor, and we need to place you on a 72-hour hold.
GRETCHEN : No. I'm not crazy. You can't... No. I'm going home.
IZZIE : Gretchen.
UNK: No, you have to let me go home. Please?
UNK: I'll just, I need to go back home. Please.
UNK: You'll hurt yourself again, right?
UNK: Isn't that your plan, so you won't have to take the exam?
IZZIE : You need some help, Gretchen.
IZZIE : If the idea of taking an exam makes you hold your palm to a burner,
IZZIE : you need some help.
IZZIE : Everyone needs help from time to time. Someone to look out for them.
IZZIE : Make sure they're OK. Make sure they're ready.
IZZIE : I have that. And you need that right now.
GRETCHEN : - I'm not crazy. - I know.
GEORGE : Just...
UNK: I didn't want to fail.
BURKE : I know.
