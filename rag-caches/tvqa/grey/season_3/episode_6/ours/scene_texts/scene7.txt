NANCY : No, I had no idea.
DEREK : Then shut up about it and eat your lunch.
MEREDITH : Derek's sister is in town.
UNK: Are you mad at me? I've been trying to talk to you all week...
UNK: Everything is not about you, Meredith.
UNK: OK. What's going on? Because George and Alex are saying...
UNK: - I don't care. - What is your problem?
CHRISTINA : I have bigger things in my life right now.
DEREK : What?
NOELLE : Nothing.
UNK: Ten blade.
UNK: Hey, Dr. O'Malley. Can you, uh, tell me what's happening in there?
UNK: She thinks you left her.
UNK: Look, man, this is all a lot to digest.
UNK: I mean, our daughter. My little girl isn't even my little girl anymore.
GEORGE : Noelle is in there freaking out because you left.
UNK: Just tell me if she is OK. Please.
GEORGE : She's gone into premature labor. Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd...
GEORGE : Dr. Montgomery, is about to do an emergency C-section on one of the babies
UNK: to stop labor in the other.
GREG : So you're delivering one of the babies right now? Today?
GEORGE : In just a few minutes.
GREG : - The boy or the girl? - Greg...
GEORGE : Ham or eggs?
UNK: You ready to go? I've already made note of it.
UNK: That's it.
MARK : You say you want a career in plastics and you can't tear yourself away
MARK : from the baby catchers to show me you want it.
UNK: Being on hold with DMV has nothing to do with plastics.
UNK: It does. Because being on hold with the DMV has to do with me.
MARK : And I have everything to do with your career in plastics.
NURSE : Tyler, Addison Montgomery needs two units of B positive blood in L&D. Stat!
UNK: I'm on it.
UNK: The biosynthetic dressing should ensure that you won't need skin grafts,
UNK: - that's good news. - Would grafts take long?
GRETCHEN : I mean, how long would something like that take? If I had needed them?
UNK: That would just depend on the severity of the burn.
UNK: So more severe than this one?
UNK: It would have to be more severe?
UNK: Just to make sure I have everything accurate, you burned your hand...
UNK: - We've been over this. Haven't we? - I'm sorry.
UNK: Look, I have a test on Friday and I have work to do.
UNK: So I have to... I want to go home.
UNK: - I'm ready to get out of here. - I'm sorry.
IZZIE : - Did you burn your hand on purpose? - Izzie, you heard Dr. Bailey.
UNK: It's OK if you did.
IZZIE : It's just, did you burn your hand to get out of taking your test?
GRETCHEN : I can't fail that damn test one more time. I just can't.
UNK: It's all anyone in my family, in my life, it's all they talk about.
