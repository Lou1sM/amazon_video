UNK: sign some papers to legal, and then I'm back. Really back.
CHRISTINA : - Yeah. - Yeah.
IZZIE : This is me. Human Resources. See you guys on the floor.
CHRISTINA : Bye.
UNK: OK. I'll be Cristina for you if you'll be Izzie for me.
MEREDITH : Deal.
MEREDITH : Derek had a woman in his trailer last night. She was ugly. Very ugly.
MEREDITH : Except she was tall and beautiful and he was naked.
GEORGE : Oh. Uh...
GEORGE : McDreamy was doing the McNasty with a McHottie?
GEORGE : That McBastard.
GEORGE : - How was that? - That was good.
DEREK : - Really? - Yeah?
CHRISTINA : Yeah.
UNK: - Channeling Izzie. Go. - OK.
GEORGE : Callie, she won't forgive me.
GEORGE : She won't talk to me. She dumped me.
UNK: Which is, I don't care about, you know, at all.
MEREDITH : Good because you deserve better. You do.
MEREDITH : You are George. I mean, seriously.
MEREDITH : Seriously. Seriously.
MEREDITH : - Was that Izzie optimistic? - Yeah, that's very Izzie.
UNK: What the hell has happened to us?
UNK: We are now the people that the people we want to be with avoid.
MEREDITH : We have careers to think about.
MEREDITH : We don't need attention from men with perfect hair.
UNK: You know, we should make a pact. There's no more dating.
UNK: - No more Derek or Callie. - 100 percent focus on work.
UNK: - They're dead to us. - They are freaking corpses to us.
UNK: MRS. BYRD : Preston Burke. What a pleasure. I have read so much about you.
BURKE : Well, thank you.
UNK: Pruitt Byrd. Medevac brought him in.
CHRISTINA : He presents with a primary cardiac tumor.
UNK: MRS. BYRD : We've been told Pruitt needs a cardiac auto-transplantation.
UNK: - A cardiac auto-transplantation? - A Humpty Dumpty surgery.
BURKE : Yes. I know what it is. Mrs. Byrd, this is a very complicated surgery.
BURKE : - You'll need thorough testing. - Done. He is a perfect candidate.
UNK: You understand what this entails?
CHRISTINA : We have to remove his heart, cut it open,
UNK: scrape out the tumor and put his heart back together.
BURKE : - Which is risky. - But possible.
UNK: MRS. BYRD : Which is why we're here. I want the very best for my Pruitt.
BURKE : - The best. - She means you.
UNK: I know that. However...
CHRISTINA : I scheduled Mr. Byrd for surgery this afternoon.
CHRISTINA : Just trying to be as efficient as possible.
UNK: Legal cleared Stevens.
UNK: Explain her parameters and make sure she understands.
UNK: - She's being assigned to me again? - She's your intern.
UNK: But I didn't think that...
BAILEY : Wouldn't it be better for her to start fresh with another resident?
UNK: - You don't want her, huh? - I want her to succeed.
CHIEF : There's still a good deal of fallout after the Duquette M & M.
UNK: There's been talk.
CHIEF : I don't need to tell you that there are doctors
UNK: who have concerns about your judgment.
UNK: - Concerns about my judgment? - Stevens was your mistake.
UNK: Do you, sir? Do you have concerns about my judgment?
CHIEF : Do you?
CHIEF : You're not going to put those concerns to rest
CHIEF : by avoiding taking responsibility for Dr. Stevens.
CHIEF : She's your intern. Again.
UNK: Transfer from Mercy West. Noelle Labatt, 32 weeks along, pregnant with twins.
GEORGE : One appears to be developing more slowly than the other.
CHRISTINA : - Hi. - Hi there.
UNK: Greg, you're the only person who cares if we're married or not.
GREG : They said we had to come here because it could be serious.
GREG : Is it serious?
UNK: At first glance you don't seem emergent enough for Mercy to send you over here.
ADDISON : You're not in labor and your vitals are fine.
UNK: They said I need a specialist because of my thing.
UNK: - Your thing? - Two uteruses?
