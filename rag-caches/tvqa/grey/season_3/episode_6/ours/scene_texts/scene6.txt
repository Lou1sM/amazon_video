UNK: MRS. BYRD : who are just trying to do their job.
CHRISTINA : You are just looking out for your husband.
UNK: You do what it takes to protect him and that does not make you horrible.
UNK: It makes you smart.
UNK: He said he was leaving.
GEORGE : She's hyperventilating. The baby's had some bradycardia.
UNK: I need you to get back into bed now.
NOELLE : - Is Greg out there? Did he leave? - Take deep breaths.
UNK: I always give him a hard time about everything.
NOELLE : He likes weddings, I hate them. He loves kids.
UNK: Me? They scare me to death.
ADDISON : Have you had any cramping, any contractions, any pressure?
NOELLE : I can't do this without him. We have to get past this.
UNK: Damn it. Right now I need you to get into bed, OK?
UNK: Why? What's happening?
UNK: Stay on your left side and whatever you do, do not push. OK?
ADDISON : I need slow deep breaths.
UNK: NANCY at dinner with Derek : So tell me about the slutty girl. Fine, the slutty intern.
UNK: - I have a problem with the slutty part. - She's not single.
UNK: She is single and wonderful. She's smart. A lot of things.
DEREK : - She's none of your business. - Wow.
NANCY : Never seen you like this over a girl. Even Addison.
DEREK : I've never been like this over a girl. Especially Addison.
UNK: Don't be bitter. Shame on Addison and all that, but he's Mark, Derek.
UNK: What did you expect? He's just Mark. And who hasn't gone there once or twice?
DEREK : - What? - Everybody sleeps with Mark.
UNK: It's practically a rite of passage.
UNK: Derek, I get it, OK? I get that they made a terrible mistake.
UNK: It wasn't a mistake. Nancy, it wasn't a mistake. It wasn't just one night.
DEREK : It was months. They were together for months. Didn't you know that?
