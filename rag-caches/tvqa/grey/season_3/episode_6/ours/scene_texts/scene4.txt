UNK: Plus I slept with my tennis partner's wife and he went out and bought a gun.
NANCY : There it is.
UNK: Oh, my God! Nancy! God.
UNK: - Let me guess. Mom send you out? - Derek's trying to ban you.
UNK: Did he tell you he's living in a trailer?
CHRISTINA : Yeah.
MEREDITH : Derek.
MEREDITH : Derek. I want to see the two uteruses.
UNK: Yeah, um, find me later.
MARK : - I miss her. - Yeah. Me too.
GREG : The Diesel pushes past cornerback Don McNeal.
GREG : He's at the 30. He's at the 20. He's at the ten.
UNK: Touchdown, Washington Redskins!
NOELLE : Sorry. One of the twins gets rowdy and Greg gets carried away.
NOELLE : He's decided that the baby is into sports of all things.
UNK: She's Daddy's little girl. I can tell, see, because when I talk to her...
UNK: The rhythm of your voice helps calm her. I read a couple of articles on that.
UNK: Dr. Karev. I knew you secretly missed my service.
IZZIE : Right.
ADDISON : Greg, Noelle, I have very good news for you.
ADDISON : According to our tests, the babies are both perfectly healthy.
ADDISON : But they are substantially different sizes for a very unique reason.
UNK: The tests indicate the babies have different due dates.
ADDISON : According to our calculations your son
UNK: was conceived a full six weeks before your daughter.
MEREDITH : - I... - Oh, God.
GREG : I don't understand. That can't be right.
GREG : - That's impossible. - It's quite possible.
UNK: Our tests are extremely accurate at predicting due dates.
UNK: But we broke up. See, she got pregnant. I wanted to get married, she didn't.
GREG : I gave her an ultimatum and she left me.
NOELLE : Greg, I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry.
GREG : We were barely speaking six weeks after the conception, let alone having sex.
UNK: Or at least I wasn't having sex.
NOELLE : It was one night, Greg. It was one night.
UNK: I didn't think that this could happen. It was nothing.
GREG : I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you didn't tell me.
UNK: God, I can't believe this.
GEORGE : He's not the father of both babies.
BAILEY : And yet no one is questioning your competence as a surgeon.
ADDISON : No. What?
UNK: I need a button. I'm down to my last clean shirt and I'm missing a button.
CHIEF : - Adele always handled my buttons. - You called her?
UNK: Adele? Oh, no.
CHIEF : I wouldn't want to bother her with something as trivial as a button.
CHIEF : I don't suppose either of you would want to?
ADDISON : I'm sorry. I have two uteruses I have to attend to.
BAILEY : I have many skills. Many skills. Surgical skills.
UNK: Your button ruptures its esophagus, I'm your woman. Otherwise...
MARK : I hear you burned your hand because you were studying?
UNK: I can't be allowed to warm soup within days of the Bar.
UNK: - You burned your hand while... - Burning my soup.
UNK: - When you grabbed the pot... - Dropped it. It was red-hot.
UNK: Must have held on to it for a little while.
MARK : - This burn's extremely deep. - Yeah. No, that's right.
UNK: - I held on and then I dropped it. - There are some deep burns.
