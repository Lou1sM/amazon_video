DEREK : Oh, wow. That's got to be pretty awkward.
MEREDITH : Divorced five years and still going at it like teens at the prom.
MEREDITH : - So to speak. - Hmm.
MEREDITH : Speaking of divorce...
UNK: I heard because I'm working with your wife.
MEREDITH : - Ex-wife. - It was time.
UNK: IZZIE cooking : - Good. - How's Finn?
UNK: Finn is... fine.
UNK: IZZIE cooking : Good.
DEREK : You're right. They're blurry. You should get some new ones.
MARK : If you go ahead with the mastectomy, there are several options.
MARK : Saline implants are used most often, but silicone has more natural look and feel.
UNK: MRS. NILES : - I can't deal with this right now. - Diana, it'll take two seconds.
UNK: MRS. NILES : You're the one who has to feel them, so you decide.
UNK: MR. NILES : - I don't care. - Believe me, you care.
BAILEY : - Dr. Karev. - Dude, he's right. You care.
UNK: DR. SAVOY : Dr. Bailey? What's wrong with my wife?
ADDISON : I'm... sorry.
UNK: As you know she has stage two B breast cancer...
UNK: I know that. Will you please tell me what's wrong with her?
BAILEY : Mr. Niles...
UNK: Because she won't. She won't talk to me.
UNK: I've tried. And I'm trying and I know this sucks and it's scary,
UNK: but we can do this. We can fight this, but she won't.
UNK: MR. NILES : She won't even look at Gus, she won't hold him, and all he wants is his mom.
UNK: MR. NILES : She's such a good mom.
UNK: MR. NILES : I know it doesn't seem like that, but she is.
UNK: OK, I can schedule a psych consult.
UNK: MR. NILES : I don't want a psych consult.
UNK: MR. NILES : I just want my wife back. Please.
UNK: MR. NILES : Now she's talking crazy.
UNK: MR. NILES : How she might not have the surgery at all.
BAILEY : - Mr. Niles. - Can you please tell her
UNK: MR. NILES : that she has to have the surgery?
UNK: Please. Somebody has to tell her.
ADAM : I did this for you.
UNK: You know you have got to stop doing things for me.
SONJA : I'm with Tom now. I love Tom.
ADAM : I still can't believe you left me for that guy.
ADAM : What does Tom have that I don't?
SONJA : He doesn't have a pierced...
MEREDITH : You two need to stay completely still
UNK: so that we can get a clearer picture.
SONJA : We fought through 19 years of marriage.
SONJA : The only time we didn't fight was when we were having sex.
UNK: Not true.
ADAM : - I still love you. - OK. I'm in hell!
GIRL : Mom? Dad?
SONJA : Scratch that.
SONJA : Now I'm in hell.
MEREDITH : Jennifer, maybe you want to go wait out in the...
JENNIFER : You guys are so paying for my therapy.
JENNIFER : And my rent.
JENNIFER : - And my new car. - Of course, sweetie.
UNK: Oh, go ahead. Coddle her.
UNK: But you are old enough to know that your parents are sexual beings
SONJA : and that they make mistakes.
UNK: Wait. Is that what you call this, Mom? A mistake?
JENNIFER : Because I call this you once again being a slut.
UNK: Hey! You don't talk to me like that. I am your mother.
UNK: What a great role model you've turned out to be. Look at you.
JENNIFER : Cheating on your husband with your ex-husband. God!
UNK: And Daddy, what are you doing? I thought you'd finally moved on.
UNK: - You were going to start dating and... - It's complicated.
