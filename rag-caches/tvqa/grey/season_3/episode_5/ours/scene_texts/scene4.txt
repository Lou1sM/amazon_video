MEREDITH : OK.
MEREDITH : Hi, I was paged by Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.
ADDISON : - Dr. Grey, welcome back. - Thank you.
UNK: - And, it's just Montgomery now. - What?
ADDISON : My name. The divorce was finalized this morning. So... Montgomery.
ADDISON : To add to our fun, we've been asked to consult on a case
UNK: where a woman has a foreign object stuck inside of her.
UNK: - Adam! It hurts whenever you move. - Keep your weight off my bad knee.
CHRISTINA : Sorry. I thought it was on the left side.
UNK: Nineteen years of marriage you'd think you'd have that one down.
ADDISON : It appears that her husband is the foreign object.
BOTH : Ex-husband.
UNK: - You had to go and get a piercing. - Sonja.
UNK: What? It's not like they're not going to find out.
UNK: This is so embarrassing.
SONJA : Embarrassing is meeting your husband for lunch with your ex-husband attached.
UNK: How long is this going to take? Because I don't want my husband finding out.
UNK: Please, could you work out some small miracle?
ADDISON : First of all we have to figure out what the piercing is caught on.
MEREDITH : - OK. - Do you have any piercings?
UNK: Me? No!
ADDISON : I'm sorry. I sell real estate.
ADAM : What's that supposed to mean? I sell real estate too.
SONJA : We've been divorced for five years, but we keep running into each other.
SONJA : You know, work stuff.
SONJA : We get together sometimes.
SONJA : It's stupid and weak, and it is never happening again.
UNK: Well, Dr. Grey's going to check on the X-rays and then,
UNK: then we'll take it from there.
UNK: But, um, you might want to cancel your lunch plans.
UNK: - Hey. That M & M was... - Yeah.
BURKE : I went to tell the chief.
BURKE : About my hand.
UNK: - Burke. How did...? - But I couldn't.
UNK: I... I don't know what I'm going to do.
CHRISTINA : Well, I can be there if you need me in surgery.
UNK: I'm not going to do any surgeries.
UNK: I'm going to catch up on paperwork.
UNK: - Wait. So, what does that mean? - I don't know.
BURKE : I don't know what I'm going to do. I need time to think.
BURKE : I have... paperwork.
BURKE : I need to do paperwork.
UNK: I know how the rumor mill works here. I'm the crazy intern.
UNK: Now I'm the intern whose friends have to baby-sit her.
UNK: Lets talk about what you're gonna do with all that money
UNK: after we don't let you destroy it.
UNK: Don't move, Adam.
UNK: - I'm not! - Were those people having sex?
UNK: They were having sex. Now they're fighting.
UNK: Good to have you back, Stevens.
IZZIE : I'm not back. I'm fine. Just not back.
UNK: Hey, you're Addison Forbes Montgomery-Shepherd.
UNK: That's a lot of names. A lot of rich-sounding names. You're rich, right?
IZZIE : That's rude. That's a rude question. I'm sorry. It's just I'm rich now too.
UNK: - Not until you deposit the check. - Do you feel guilty?
ADDISON : - I'm sorry? - Being rich.
UNK: I have all this money now and don't feel like I did anything to deserve it
IZZIE : and I can't talk to my friends about it because they're poor.
GEORGE : Standing right here, Izzie.
UNK: Deposit the check, Stevens. Just start there, OK?
UNK: And, um... the guilt will work itself out.
MEREDITH : Hey. You're everywhere.
UNK: Well, I'm sorry. For once it was actually not on purpose.
MEREDITH : Do these look blurry to you?
DEREK : What exactly am I looking at?
MEREDITH : A divorced couple who got stuck together during...
