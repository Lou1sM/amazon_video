UNK: Ten blade.
ADDISON : As soon as we hear something about your ex-husband,
ADDISON : we'll let you know.
ADDISON : Since I removed your IUD, you may want to use a backup method.
UNK: Oh, I doubt I'll be having sex anytime soon,
SONJA : once I tell Tom.
UNK: You're gonna tell your husband?
SONJA : You know, the first time it happened, I felt so guilty.
UNK: And I wasn't going to tell Tom because it wasn't gonna happen again.
SONJA : And then it happened again. And again.
UNK: And then somewhere along the way I just stopped feeling guilty.
SONJA : Yeah. I'm going to tell my husband.
SONJA : I think the truth just has to come out, you know?
CHRISTINA : Dr. Burke, I know it's a lot to ask,
CHRISTINA : but I would really appreciate it if you'd let me try my whip stitch.
BURKE : All right. Take a good bite.
BURKE : You want to make sure it holds.
UNK: IZZIE cooking : Good.
BURKE : Don't put too much pressure.
UNK: There. Keep pulling.
GEORGE : Oh, my God.
UNK: Cristina's doing a running whip stitch. On a heart.
ALEX : I guess sleeping with your boss has its perks.
GEORGE : This sucks. Cristina gets sex and perks.
UNK: Maybe you should just apologize again, George.
UNK: Yeah, because you're in a great position to give relationship advice.
UNK: Cristina's doing a running whip stitch. On a heart.
UNK: MRS. NILES : I don't feel like talking.
BAILEY : When I'm driving home at night, after a long day at work,
BAILEY : all I can think about is getting to my baby.
UNK: Is this where you tell me fight cancer so I don't miss out on motherhood...
BAILEY : Then I get home. The baby's crying.
BAILEY : The exhaustion hits
BAILEY : and I resent that tiny baby's presence
BAILEY : in my house.
BAILEY : My previously very quiet house.
UNK: MRS. NILES : Why are you telling me this?
BAILEY : So you know what I do?
BAILEY : First I pick a fight with my husband, you know,
BAILEY : blame him for not settling the baby down.
BAILEY : Then I bitch about the neighbor's loud music.
BAILEY : Then if I'm really tired and pissed off,
BAILEY : I blame the baby.
UNK: I mean, if you hadn't been breastfeeding,
BAILEY : you never would have thought the lump was a clogged milk duct.
UNK: You would've gone to the doctor as soon as you felt it.
UNK: The cancer wouldn't have gotten this far
BAILEY : and you wouldn't be here making this decision.
BAILEY : Am I close?
UNK: What kind of a mother blames her own baby for her cancer?
UNK: A mother who's human. A mother who's overwhelmed.
UNK: MRS. NILES : If this is going to kill me eventually,
UNK: wouldn't it be easier if it happened when Gus was little?
UNK: MRS. NILES : Wouldn't it be easier for him if I just never existed?
UNK: OK. Now this is the part when I tell you
UNK: to fight the cancer so that you don't miss out on the joys of motherhood.
MEREDITH : - Derek. - Yeah. Hey, you know what I like?
UNK: I like that we're civilized.
DEREK : We're these adult grown up people who can be divorced and friendly.
