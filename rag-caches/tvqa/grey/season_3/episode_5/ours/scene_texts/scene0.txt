GEORGE : I thought we were done with the whole muffin thing.
UNK: - This isn't muffins. This is breakfast. - Mmm.
IZZIE : Mer needs a good solid breakfast. First day back after the big surgery.
UNK: Are you OK?
UNK: Of course I'm OK. I'm a millionaire. Fruit?
UNK: MR. NILES : Huh?
IZZIE : What do you guys think about B&B's?
UNK: I'm thinking about opening a B&B in Vermont where the foliage is.
GEORGE : - You should go back to bed. - Can't. I'm going to the hospital.
UNK: - Are you going to go talk to the chief? - Nope. Going to clean out my locker.
IZZIE : I could buy a hotel. How much do you think a hotel costs?
UNK: - Izzie! - Is that...
UNK: That is 8 million. Eight million doesn't like to have juice spilled on it.
MEREDITH : You have to take that to the bank today. It's making me nervous.
UNK: I will. As soon as I clean out my locker.
UNK: I am fine. Really, I'm fine.
IZZIE : Denny loved me. He wanted me to have this money.
IZZIE : He wants me to be happy, so I'm happy. Juice?
MEREDITH : She's losing it.
UNK: She almost battered and deep-fried an 8.5 million dollar check.
UNK: That kind of money?
CHRISTINA : I'd buy my own hospital and stock it full of sick people.
UNK: Valvuloplasties and ruptured aneurysms.
UNK: You're a psycho.
UNK: I'm not the one with an 8.5 million dollar check I won't cash.
IZZIE : Stop talking about me. I'm fine.
IZZIE : I'm cleaning out my locker and I am going home.
UNK: Mer is the one with problems.
UNK: What's wrong with me?
MEREDITH : Well, you haven't told McDreamy that you dumped McVet.
UNK: - You haven't done that? - Tell him already.
GEORGE : - She's scared. - I am not scared.
MEREDITH : Derek walked away. He walked away and maybe that's a good thing.
UNK: Maybe he's happier. Maybe he's moved on.
MEREDITH : He's got Addison here. He's got Mark here.
MEREDITH : He's got a lot to deal with. I'm not going to make him feel guilty.
UNK: I mean, I am being an adult here. I am not going to drag him into our whole...
MEREDITH : Izzie is the one with the big check.
IZZIE : I'm fine.
UNK: Guilt never goes anywhere on its own. It brings its friends
UNK: doubt and insecurity.
UNK: MARK to Callie's ringing cell : - That your boyfriend again? - I do not have a boyfriend.
MARK : Then why the guilty face?
CALLIE : You were sexier when you weren't talking.
BAILEY : Am I keeping you, O'Malley?
UNK: - M & M in 15 minutes, people. - We get to go to M & M?
GEORGE : Even if we haven't finished our rounds?
UNK: - I want all of you at the M & M today. - Yes!
BAILEY : People die in this hospital on our watch.
UNK: Once a month we meet to discuss how our actions contributed to the deaths.
