UNK: Come on, Dr. Burke. We all know the LVAD was cut by an intern.
GEORGE : I'm going to my happy place.
UNK: The chain of events remain unclear.
UNK: It remains unclear to you because you were in the ER with a gunshot wound.
UNK: DR. SAVOY : Why aren't we hearing from Dr. Bailey?
UNK: - She was the physician on the case. - I am the attending on record.
BAILEY : Yes, I was the resident in charge.
UNK: Uh... Dr. Burke has summarized the medical facts of this case.
BAILEY : Are there any questions for me?
MAN : Dr. Bailey.
UNK: DR. SAVOY : You recently had a baby, Dr. Bailey?
BAILEY : I don't see what that has to do with this.
UNK: Sleep deprivation with swings in hormone levels could cloud anyone's judgment.
BAILEY : I sleep just fine, Dr. Savoy.
UNK: Really? Because if a patient died due to my poor decision-making,
UNK: I'd lose at least a little sleep over it.
CHIEF : Let me remind everyone that our purpose here is not to place blame.
CHIEF : This is a forum to discuss mistakes in patient care and learn from them.
UNK: DR. SAVOY : So far I haven't heard Dr. Bailey admit to a mistake.
CHRISTINA : Why don't they just put a bullet in the back of her head?
MEREDITH : It would be more humane.
UNK: DR. SAVOY : So for a period of several hours,
UNK: your interns were running amok in the hospital, totally unsupervised.
BAILEY : - I'm waiting for a question. - The question is : where were you?
BAILEY : There was the shooting and the ER was chaotic.
UNK: The ER's always chaotic. Did you page them during this time?
UNK: Yes. I paged them multiple times.
UNK: Well, apparently, they thought it was OK to ignore your pages.
UNK: Doctor, why do you think your interns have such contempt for your authority?
ALEX : You don't know what you're talking about!
BAILEY : Dr. Karev, sit down.
MEREDITH : Izzie.
BAILEY : Next question.
LAWYER : Derek says that neither of you brought assets into the marriage.
ADDISON : I had my trust fund. And a sparkling personality and the futon couch.
DEREK : Yes, Addison had a very ugly, very heavy futon couch.
UNK: - Whatever happened to that couch? - We gave it to Mark.
DEREK : - She can have him. - I don't want him.
DEREK : That's settled. What else?
UNK: So, aside from Addison's trust fund which remains in her name,
UNK: you'll split everything. Stocks, bonds, 401 k's, down the middle.
LAWYER : The only thing that gets complicated is the real estate.
DEREK : Let me make this simple.
UNK: I'd like to keep my trailer and the land in Seattle. Addison can have the rest.
ADDISON : Hold on.
LAWYER : The house in the Hamptons and the brownstone near Central Park?
LAWYER : - That's very generous. - Thank you.
ADDISON : - He's up to something. - I'm not.
UNK: I came here to fight over CDs and books. War over a crystal vase.
UNK: - What are you up to? - The divorce is my fault.
DEREK : - Let me take responsibility. - We both had affairs.
UNK: You had a one-night stand with Mark.
UNK: Derek, actually... Well, it was...
UNK: All right. OK. It was two... two nights. You made a mistake.
DEREK : Meredith and I, we had a relationship.
DEREK : Make these changes and I'll sign it today.
MEREDITH : - You weren't supposed to be in here. - You shouldn't have had to see that.
UNK: No, it's fine. I'm fine.
IZZIE : Clearly the doctor thing was not working for me.
IZZIE : So go about your business. Run labs, cure cancer. I'm fine.
GEORGE : You're not going home.
GEORGE : Either you hang out with us or we'll call your mother.
UNK: She's a few hours away, I'm sure she wouldn't mind staying with you.
MEREDITH : All day.
IZZIE : - You wouldn't. - Dialing!
UNK: Whoa! Hey. OK.
