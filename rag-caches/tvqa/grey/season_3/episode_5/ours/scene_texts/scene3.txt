IZZIE : I'll just...
IZZIE : ...go hang out in the locker room.
CHIEF : What is she doing here? She has no business in this room.
ALEX : What are you looking at me for?
ALEX : I didn't have anything to do with this.
ALEX : I didn't have anything to do with any of this.
GEORGE : I'll stay with her today if that's OK.
UNK: I'll update charts and I'll run labs and just keep an eye on her,
GEORGE : if that's OK.
GEORGE : - She shouldn't be alone. - Fine.
MAN : Dr. Bailey.
UNK: - We just want to say about the M & M... - We're sorry.
BAILEY : No. You do not get to apologize to me for this. You do not get to feel better.
UNK: And neither do I. Get to work. O'Malley, just keep an eye on her.
GEORGE : Yes, Dr. Bailey.
UNK: DR. SAVOY : Dr. Bailey, you understand it's nothing personal.
BAILEY : People talking about your hormone levels starts feeling pretty personal.
UNK: Hey, Dr. Bailey. Look, you're the baby whisperer.
UNK: Guess who drank the whole bottle? Want to hold him?
BAILEY : Actually, now isn't a good time. I'm about to go and get your wife's labs.
UNK: Yeah. Do you think you could talk to her? She's kind of freaking out.
UNK: She's not sure about the mastectomy. She's thinking a lumpectomy.
UNK: MR. NILES : She likes you. Can you talk her into...
UNK: No, no. It's not my job to talk her into anything.
BAILEY : Maybe if she knew more about her reconstructive options.
BAILEY : I'll send our plastic surgeon up.
UNK: - Hey, chief. You got a minute? - Sure.
UNK: - Quite a morning. - It was.
UNK: It's good to be reminded how important it is to be at the top of your game.
BURKE : That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
UNK: I am so glad you're back. I need your help focusing the staff.
CHIEF : They respond to you as an authority figure.
UNK: I mean, you're an example of what they should be. A leader.
UNK: I'm glad to have you back, Preston.
BURKE : Thank you, chief.
DEREK : - You're back. - I am.
UNK: You look, uh, good without an appendix. It suits you.
MEREDITH : How are you?
IZZIE : Fine.
MEREDITH : - How are you? - I'm great.
DEREK : Feeling well? No pain?
DEREK : No pain.
BAILEY : Oh.
MEREDITH : That's your wife. I'm on her service.
UNK: Oh, OK, then. I will stay out of your way.
