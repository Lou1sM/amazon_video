UNK: The next 24 to 48 hours are really critical, but...
CHRISTINA : We expect your father to make a full recovery.
JENNIFER : Thank you so much, Dr. Burke.
MEREDITH : First do no harm. Easier said than done.
UNK: We can take all the oaths in the world,
UNK: but the fact is most of us do harm all the time.
UNK: - I have eight million dollars. - So I've heard.
IZZIE : - I can do anything I want. - Just about.
IZZIE : And all I really want to do is a running whip stitch.
CHIEF : My first year as an intern
UNK: I had a cardiac patient who blew out his lung while I transported him to CT.
UNK: I called in a code. By the time everyone got there, he was dead.
UNK: If I'd put a chest tube in right away...
DEREK : You made a mistake.
CHIEF : But I stayed. I worked.
CHIEF : I learned.
CHIEF : I never made that mistake again.
UNK: If I had quit, all I would've had
UNK: was that life...
CHIEF : ...that I lost.
CHIEF : Instead, I get to save lives.
CHIEF : Every day I get to save lives.
MEREDITH : Sometimes even when we're trying to help,
MEREDITH : we do more harm than good.
MARK : She told you.
UNK: I've known you my whole life.
MARK : I grew up with you, so I know what you're thinking.
UNK: That there is a year of your life wasted
MARK : trying to make it work with Addison and you could have been with Meredith.
UNK: That you could be happy right now.
UNK: That all of this... everything.
MARK : That you and Meredith could have had a real chance.
BAILEY : Still...
MARK : ...I thought you should know the truth. Thought I owed you that.
MARK : - As a friend. - You're not my friend.
UNK: And then the guilt rears its ugly head.
UNK: What you do with that guilt is up to you.
UNK: DR. SAVOY : Baby-sitting, Dr. Bailey?
BAILEY : That's right. I'm baby-sitting.
BAILEY : I'm being all unprofessional and emotionally involved
BAILEY : while my patient and her husband are having a moment together.
UNK: You might want to leave now.
UNK: I'm feeling a rush of hormones coming on and there's no telling what I might do.
ALEX : How's it going in there?
BAILEY : I think they're leaning towards a mastectomy.
UNK: That's good.
ALEX : About Izzie.
ALEX : - I didn't do anything. - I know, Karev.
BAILEY : You didn't do anything, you weren't even here.
ALEX : No, listen. I knew.
UNK: Izzie told me what she was gonna do, but I didn't want to get involved.
ALEX : I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything to stop her.
ALEX : You weren't the only one.
CHRISTINA : Alex.
BURKE : Thank you.
MEREDITH : We're left with a choice.
GEORGE : I got fried chicken, extra crispy.
GEORGE : Coleslaw, peach cobbler,
GEORGE : Beetle Jump and...
UNK: ...Samurai Ambush.
CALLIE : The other night when I told you I was done trying to compete,
UNK: that was me breaking up with you.
MEREDITH : No.
GEORGE : No, I think I would've noticed that.
CALLIE : Except you didn't.
CALLIE : Which is why I broke up with you.
MARK : At least now you don't have to feel guilty anymore.
ADDISON : Shut up.
UNK: Either let the guilt throw you back into the behavior
UNK: that got you into trouble in the first place...
MEREDITH : ...or...
MEREDITH : ...learn from the guilt and do your best to move on.
MEREDITH : Are you seriously not going to deposit that check?
IZZIE : Some good needs to come from this money.
UNK: And until I know what that good is, no, I'm not depositing the check.
