CHIEF : You took a lot of hits today at that M & M.
CHIEF : Some of them justified. Some of them not.
CHIEF : Compassion and empathy are a big part of the job.
UNK: Look, I don't care what Savoy said.
CHIEF : And I know I haven't always been supportive.
CHIEF : But being a parent makes you a better doctor.
IZZIE : Hi. I just wanted to say hi.
IZZIE : Denny left me 8 million dollars. 8.7 million dollars to be exact.
UNK: Did you know? That he had money? Because I didn't know.
BURKE : No. I didn't know.
IZZIE : I'm thinking about using it to travel. Maybe go to Italy. I've never been.
IZZIE : - I hear Venice is amazing. - Izzie.
IZZIE : I'm fine. Really I am. I'm fine.
IZZIE : Everyone thinks I'm not. Everyone thinks I'm... but I'm fine.
BURKE : You're fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
IZZIE : So...
BURKE : I got shot.
BURKE : I got shot because I was coming back to the hospital to check on Denny.
UNK: Because you told me to.
BURKE : I'm not fine.
BURKE : Denny asked you to marry him and now he is dead. You're not fine.
BURKE : Don't come in here and...
IZZIE : ...just.
BURKE : We're not fine.
IZZIE : I'm sorry. We were friends.
IZZIE : You were my boss, but I think we were friends too.
UNK: And I never meant for anyone to get hurt.
IZZIE : And I know there is nothing I can do to take it back.
MEREDITH : No.
IZZIE : Preston, please.
BURKE : You quit.
BURKE : You quit being a surgeon.
UNK: You have two good hands!
BURKE : And you aren't using them.
BURKE : Feel guilty about that.
ADAM : Sonja, quit grabbing my leg.
SONJA : I am not grabbing you anywhere. She is.
CHRISTINA : Mr. Morris, we need to position you correctly in order to get a clear image.
ADDISON : Dr. Yang, move him a little to the left.
ADDISON : Hey, what are you doing here?
UNK: Well, I heard about it. I had to see it.
UNK: And I've seen enough.
ADDISON : Dr. Yang, I need you to lift him a little as you pull him.
GEORGE : Trying.
UNK: Now lift his right leg 20 degrees.
UNK: - Pain! - Freeze! Hold that position.
UNK: OK, now, Dr. Grey, can you kind of slowly
ADDISON : swirl Mrs. Kellman in a counter-clockwise direction?
MEREDITH : - Swirl? - Swirl?
ADDISON : - Swirl. - Swirl.
UNK: Oh. OK.
UNK: - Oh, my God. Sonja. - God, Adam, not now.
CHIEF : - Careful! Careful! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
UNK: Yeah, yeah, now. Grey, Yang.
UNK: On the count of three, I want you to slowly,
ADDISON : gently pull them apart.
UNK: One, two, three.
UNK: OK, he's having a...
UNK: - Sonja! - He's having a heart attack!
CHRISTINA : Thank God. I mean, Code Blue!
UNK: He's tearing through his aorta.
CHIEF : We need to get him to an OR or he's going to die.
UNK: Who's the surgeon on call?
NURSE : - Dr. Harrison, but he's in surgery. - Where's Burke?
CHRISTINA : Conference room. He's not on the board yet.
BURKE : He is now. Notify the OR.
BURKE : Let's move, people. Come on! Go, go!
CHRISTINA : - How do we do this? - You stand on my right side.
CHRISTINA : - On your right side. - If, during the procedure...
CHRISTINA : - If you tremor. - I'll look at you
UNK: and you'll do the sutures we've practiced.
UNK: What if one of the nurses notices? What if they say something?
UNK: Cristina, I can't walk away from this surgery.
UNK: If I do, that man in there will die. So tremor or no tremor, I have to try.
BURKE : But you...
CHRISTINA : I'm your intern. I will be there on your right side.
