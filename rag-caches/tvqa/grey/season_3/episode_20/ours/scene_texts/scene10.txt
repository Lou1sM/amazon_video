UNK: Yeah. I know how it is, so...
Callie : I'm really, really tired, so I'll just see you at home.
MVO : - OK. - OK.
George : OK. OK.
Alex : - Solitaire. - My dad taught me.
UNK: That sounds so weird. My dad.
UNK: Good weird, though. So, you and the redhead going to let me go home?
Jane : Or are you too busy making eyes at each other to even ask?
Woman : - What? - Ava...
UNK: No. It's Shannon.
Susan : - Listen... - My name is Shannon. Shannon Marie.
Woman : I'm sorry.
Jane : Those are supposed to be my people. I belong with them, Alex.
Jane : I'm supposed to go with them.
UNK: Your people, we don't know who they are.
UNK: You don't want to find them. You want to keep me all to yourself.
Jane : Well, here I am. Your pathetic, captive audience.
Jane : Isn't it sad that I'm the best you can do?
Addison : - Ava... - My name is not Ava!
UNK: You made it up! It's not me!
UNK: Get out! Get out!
MVO : Some people believe that without history,
MVO : our lives amount to nothing.
Richard : Sloan, you brought me to a bar.
Richard : - I don't drink. - Perfect.
UNK: Better to keep your mind sharp. Let the ladies do the drinking.
Richard : You think, if you get me laid, I might make you Chief.
MVO : At some point, we all have to choose.
UNK: Do we fall back on what we know?
UNK: - I hear Dr. Marlow was going home. - About time.
UNK: The fingernails. The hand holding. Well played.
Burke : Now you can get back to being Cristina.
MVO : Or do we step forward to something new?
MVO : It's hard not to be haunted by our past.
MVO : Our history is what shapes us, what guides us.
Cristina : - Seriously? - OK, that stops right now.
UNK: It's just, I'm waiting for Derek and I'm very tired.
Susan : - I don't care. Let me in. - Excuse me?
Susan : It's freezing out here and I've been working myself up to saying this,
UNK: well, for awhile, so I need you to let me in now. Please.
Susan : It's my fault your father didn't fight harder for you.
Susan : I knew about you.
UNK: I could have pushed him to be part of your life. I should have.
Susan : You were a child. We were the adults.
Susan : But we were just married and it was new and that's what I cared about.
UNK: I know the groceries and everything are a little much, that's just what I do.
Susan : Quit looking at me like I'm crazy, that's not fair.
Susan : I'm just trying to find a way to be there for you the only way I know how,
Susan : and if you can't accept that, then fine.
Susan : Just stop being so rude. And I...
UNK: OK. I'm overstepping again, aren't I?
Meredith : As mothers go, I've only ever known overbearing.
Meredith : Never overprotective. This is all new.
UNK: Jane Doe : - It's OK. - It is?
Meredith : Yes.
MVO : Our history resurfaces. Time after time after time.
Mark : Not just surgery, but Chief of Surgery.
Meredith : - Really? - Well, not for much longer, really.
UNK: I'm going to go... over there.
Mark : Hold down the fort, Chief.
Richard : So, um... you come here often?
UNK: Well, sometimes. It's on my way home from bio class.
UNK: Excuse me. Is this seat taken?
MVO : No.
UNK: - Um, it was nice talking to you. - You too.
UNK: The last time I tried to pick up a woman
Richard : I had a Harvey Wallbanger in one hand and an afro pick in the other.
Derek : - Richard. - Well, you think about it.
UNK: I mean, when you're married you like to think you still have game.
Addison : - Practice on me. - I'm sorry?
Addison : Mark's right. I mean, he's wrong about so many things,
Addison : but he is right about this. You need to get back out there.
Addison : So. Practice.
Richard : - I wouldn't know where to start. - Ask me to dance.
Richard : - There's no dance floor. - So, ask me anyway.
MVO : So we have to remember...
MVO : ...sometimes the most important history
MVO : is the history we're making today.
