Richard : The sweater.
Richard : Actually, it's my ex-wife.
Richard : - It's amicable. - I'm sorry?
Richard : The divorce. It's amicable, very friendly.
Richard : I'm a friendly guy.
UNK: - "I'm a friendly guy"? - Sloan.
Mark : She pressed five and got off at three.
UNK: She'd rather walk upstairs than flirt with you.
UNK: She'd rather climb up the building.
Richard : - I wasn't flirting. - You're telling me.
Mark : There's no need to be embarrassed.
UNK: Time to shake off the rust and get back in the game.
UNK: - You need a wingman. - I have patients to see.
Mark : We'd make a great team.
UNK: Nothing like a ventricular reconstruction to start your morning.
Cristina : OK, you've officially become creepy. Creepy and stalking.
UNK: Burke and I are getting married next month.
Colin : We both know you're not the marrying kind.
Cristina : You don't know that. You don't know me.
Colin : Just to be sure you're fully aware of what you're passing up,
Colin : I'd like you to assist me on my heterotropic heart transplant today.
UNK: A piggyback transplant? Seriously?
Colin : Burke will want to scrub in too.
Colin : See how it's done.
UNK: Heterotopic transplant. He is upping his game.
Cristina : I need a gambit. I need to force him into the defensive.
Cristina : Take his queen.
UNK: - You never played chess? - I'm not a geek.
UNK: I've got to crush him. Annihilate him at his own game.
Meredith : So it's weird, right? Susan keeps stopping by like this?
UNK: We just became friends or whatever you call your estranged father's wife.
Alex : You may be confused since you were raised by wolves,
UNK: but this is what mothers do.
Alex : They stop by, they stock the fridge. Think she might do our laundry?
UNK: Hey, get your own fake mom.
UNK: Hey. Bad night on call?
UNK: When my patient's gooey abscess exploded all over me at 4 : 00 a. m.?
UNK: - That was the highlight. - Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Izzie : Pray for us sinners, now...
Alex : - Iz, you look nice. - Did you just come from confession?
Meredith : - In a church? - Shut up.
Alex : Izzie Stevens does penance. You did something bad.
UNK: I feel like poo. Hope I make it today without falling asleep.
UNK: Do you want to make a coffee date? 3 : 00? You could use a little pick-me-up.
UNK: - Yeah. That sounds nice. Really nice. - Good.
MVO : OK.
UNK: Smile. Oh, come on, man. That's not a smile.
UNK: Jane Doe : Can I see?
UNK: Jane Doe : It's me? Oh, my God.
UNK: This is going to sound terrible, but I'm not bad looking.
UNK: I think beautiful is the word you're looking for.
