Bailey : O'Malley. Did Stevens ask for you here?
Izzie : - No, I did not. - You need to turn yourself around...
UNK: - Giving bone marrow? - This is private.
George : I'm not leaving.
Izzie : - George! - No.
George : Make me.
Meredith : - Hey! - Sorry. I'm starting now.
Izzie : Let me know when you're going to do stuff, OK?
George : Hey. You're OK.
George : I got it here.
Bailey : Fine. Stevens, I'm going, unless you need me to call security.
Izzie : I'll manage.
Meredith : Thank you.
Izzie : You said back off.
George : You didn't tell me you were having a hole drilled in your damn hip.
George : For who?
George : What's this private matter?
Doctor : - OK. I'm going in when you're ready. - Yeah.
UNK: Yeah?
Meredith : - Hey, Callie. - Hey.
Meredith : If you could just take these two, then that will free me up to...
UNK: Oh, no, no. No, I'm not here to work. I'm sorry.
UNK: I haven't slept in two days. I'm looking for George to meet up for coffee.
Susan : - Oh. - So, yeah.
Meredith : OK. He's, uh, with Izzie, I think.
Meredith : If you're not here to work, I'm just going to take these back. Thanks.
UNK: Fifteen blade.
Colin : Suction, please.
UNK: Using the superior transeptal approach for the atriotomy, are you?
Burke : Is that a problem?
UNK: Not unless your intention is to kill the patient.
Burke : From what I've read...
UNK: Reading about procedure is one thing, performing is another.
Colin : I should never have allowed you to scrub in.
Colin : I think it best from this point on that you simply observe.
Colin : Suction, please.
Colin : Hurry up.
George : Use the wheelchair. You're going to be sore.
Izzie : I'm aware. I'm fine now. Thank you.
George : - You mean pantless, but fine? - Crap.
Derek : Stand.
George : - I got it. - OK.
