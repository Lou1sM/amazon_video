UNK: - I can go? - You're still getting IV antibiotics,
Alex : and we're monitoring the baby very closely right now.
UNK: Jane Doe : But you can make it happen, right?
UNK: Jane Doe : Come on, Alex. Don't doctor me, help me get out of here.
Alex : Dr. Montgomery's got you on strict bedrest until your delivery.
Alex : But I'll ask. Maybe you can do it from home.
UNK: Home. Wow.
MVO : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: - You OK? You look... - I'm in a horrible mood.
Meredith : I yelled at Susan. I think I scared off my fake mommy forever.
UNK: - Mmm... Need cheering up? - No.
UNK: - Me either. It's going to be OK. - You think?
UNK: Yes, Susan will be OK.
Meredith : - How'd it go with the Chief? - As well as you and Susan.
UNK: - Wow. We make a good team. - Hm.
UNK: I've been waiting in Really Old Guy's Room for 20 minutes.
UNK: - Sorry. We decided to eat here today. - Nobody told me.
UNK: Anybody... move.
George : Anybody know what's going on with Izzie?
UNK: - Something's going on! - Just ask her yourself.
George : - I would if I knew where she was. - I brought you lunch.
Meredith : - You've got stuff on your hands. - I'm trying to scare away Cardio God.
Meredith : - With pretty fingers? - He takes my rook, I take his bishop.
UNK: Hey, Pouty Head. Why you so sad? No-Face girl's family taking her home?
Meredith : - Someone claimed Ava? - Yeah, her parents.
UNK: - She must be relieved. - Unless they suck.
Cristina : Can you imagine? You can't remember a family and they show up,
UNK: - turns out they're killers. - Or over-sharers.
Alex : Whatever. She's a patient.
Alex : I don't give a crap who her parents are or where she goes. Can we move on?
George : One second.
George : What's up with Izzie?
Bailey : - None of your concern. - It is my concern.
George : - I demand to know. - I didn't just hear you say you demand.
UNK: Well, are you her father? Are you her husband?
Bailey : Then stay here and keep your mind on your job, you hear me?
Bailey : Grey. Uh, look, I need to be upstairs,
Bailey : so do not let this out of your sight.
Bailey : Walk this to the lab, watch the lab run the tests,
Bailey : bring the test results directly to me, nobody else.
UNK: It's Izzie? What's the matter?
Bailey : You will be discreet and not ask a bunch of questions.
Bailey : Now this is a private matter. She needs these results now.
MVO : OK.
