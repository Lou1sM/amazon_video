Dustin : Hannah.
UNK: An eleven-year old girl. That's the private matter. She's mine.
UNK: Don't... don't look at me.
Izzie : My mother wanted me to keep her.
Izzie : But I knew, even at 16 I knew, that baby deserved better
UNK: than life at a Chehalis trailer park.
Izzie : And now she's here and...
Izzie : ...and she might be dying and she doesn't want to meet me.
Izzie : Oh, crap.
Izzie : I didn't think I really cared until she said no.
UNK: How about that?
Izzie : I can say Hail Mary's until...
Izzie : ...until I turn into Mary, but I still miss you.
Colin : Not the...
UNK: ...the sex.
UNK: It was not tragic, George.
Izzie : But I'll live without it.
Izzie : I won't make it if you can't be my friend.
Izzie : If we can't...
George : What you did today,
George : you should be proud.
George : I'll get an orderly to take you downstairs. But I have to go.
Joan : You understand?
Cristina : Some surgery.
Cristina : - And Colin was... - Brilliant.
Burke : He's a gifted surgeon.
UNK: Listen, I had a question.
UNK: When you moved the atrium to the vena cava,
Cristina : why did you switch from 3-O to 5-O sutures?
UNK: You want to use the finest sutures you can for vascular structures.
Burke : Delicate tissue demands a delicate touch.
Cristina : Right. That makes sense.
Meredith : - Thank you. - Of course.
Burke : - See you at home? - Yeah.
UNK: - How long have you been there? - Long enough.
UNK: You've been playing our little game all day. But what I just saw...
Colin : ...that was real. The question about the sutures,
Colin : that was from my paper you helped me write.
Colin : You already knew the answer.
UNK: The Cristina Yang I knew was concerned with excellence.
UNK: She would never play helpless girl, trying to build up a grown man's ego.
Colin : What has become of you?
Cristina : I've learned that sometimes you have to think about other people.
Colin : - You compromised yourself. - No.
Colin : I'm going home. You're right. It's senseless coming here,
Colin : chasing after a job that was beneath me, just so I could be near a woman who...
Colin : ...a woman who apparently no longer exists.
Colin : Best of luck with the wedding.
Izzie : There they are.
UNK: I can't. I can't.
Izzie : - You look. Please, you look for me. - OK.
George : She's getting the infusion. You did it.
UNK: Is she...?
UNK: - How does she look? - You can look, see for yourself.
UNK: It's OK. She can't see us from here.
George : She's got your eyes. And your mouth.
UNK: I mean, she probably talks a lot and eats a lot.
George : If she's in pain, she's not letting on.
George : Man, she's tough.
Alex : Come on.
Izzie : - That's her, George. That's Hannah. - Yeah.
UNK: She's beautiful, don't you think? She's really beautiful.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, she's a heartbreaker.
UNK: Need some help?
Bailey : I know you didn't just wander in here to help me change pillowcases.
UNK: - You warned me she could be a problem. - Who, Meredith?
Derek : You love somebody, you think you can handle it all.
Bailey : You've done all right. Both of you.
Derek : I came out here to be Chief and Meredith complicates that.
UNK: Huh. Now if this turns into an eitherlor,
Bailey : you pick the person you love. End of story.
UNK: Look, all this means nothing if you're alone.
UNK: Oh, crap! Our coffee.
UNK: I'm... I'm sorry. I forgot. I got so busy...
UNK: - Oh, yeah? With what? - Well, the clinic.
UNK: The patients and... well, you know how it is.
George : Oh, man.
