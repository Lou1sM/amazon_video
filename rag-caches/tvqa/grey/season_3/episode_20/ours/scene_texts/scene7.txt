Izzie : - Wow. That's a big needle. - It's standard.
UNK: You should start to feel numb ten minutes after I inject the lidocaine.
UNK: Yeah. No, I know. I've given epidurals before. I know that's the needle.
UNK: It's just that it seems so much bigger now that it's going into my spine.
Doctor : - Little stick. - Oh, God.
Bailey : You sure I can't call one of your friends?
UNK: You're going to need somebody to hold your hand.
MVO : No.
Meredith : - Thank you. - You sure?
Bailey : I can take a lot of pressure. Just it's rough as sandpaper.
UNK: A little pressure.
UNK: Meredith! Tell me where she is.
UNK: - I can't! If she wanted you to know... - She does. She...
George : We're just having one of our stupid fights.
George : You know how wrong it is if she's in trouble
George : and I'm not there because we're being idiots?
George : Come on. Meredith, please.
Meredith : She's upstairs in Procedure Room A. That's all I know.
Meredith : Thank you.
UNK: So. Dr. Montgomery says you can take your daughter home,
Alex : but she wants to talk to her local ob-gyn.
UNK: Things to go over before we release her.
Caroline : I can't.
UNK: Well, OK. I can go through all this with your husband if...
Joan : No, you don't understand. I can't take her home.
Joan : That girl is not my daughter.
Joan : She does look an awful lot like Shannon.
Joan : Sometimes she even sounds like her.
Alex : Well, with the surgery and the loss of memory...
Joan : A mother knows her own child, Dr. Karev. And that is not my child.
UNK: - But your husband is... - Look, if that's not Shannon,
Joan : we still don't know where our girl is. Do you understand?
Joan : He needs it to be her.
Joan : How am I supposed to tell him? How do I tell either of them?
Addison : - Mrs. Waring... - Dr. Karev...
Joan : ...would you ask my husband to meet me in the lobby?
Alex : - You have to face her. - Please, tell her I'm sorry.
Richard : - Things have changed. - No, no. Nothing has changed.
Derek : I deserve your support. Tell me I didn't move for nothing.
Richard : You moved to Seattle to start a new life.
Richard : And you did. You have a fantastic woman who loves you.
Derek : This is about my career.
Richard : Do you know what being Chief will do to you? Why do you think I'm divorced?
Richard : Or dying my hair? You can't do it all.
UNK: - Not if you want to be Chief. - You couldn't.
Richard : - Neither can you. - Don't put your mistake on me!
UNK: I am the best candidate for this job. You and I know it.
Derek : That is the only factor you need to consider.
UNK: I don't need protection, don't want it.
Richard : I'm not trying to protect you, Derek. I told Ellis.
Richard : I promised her that I would look after her daughter.
