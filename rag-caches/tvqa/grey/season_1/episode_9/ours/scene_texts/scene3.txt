Devo : You're hotshot doctors. You'll come up with something else.
Devo : As long as it doesn't answer to Wilbur and say "oink,"
Devo : I don't care what it is.
UNK: Mr. Duff : Your nostrils are flaring.
Izzie : They are not.
UNK: Mr. Duff : You're into me. I can tell.
UNK: Mr. Duff : "Dr. Small and Angry" was a hot appetizer,
UNK: Mr. Duff : but you, doc, are a smorgasbord of lust.
Izzie : Mr. Duff, you're pressing your luck.
UNK: Mr. Duff : Would you press it for me?
Izzie : I hope you're not claustrophobic.
Izzie : You're staring at me. Stop it.
UNK: Mr. Duff : I'm looking at you, sweetheart, but it's the strangest thing.
UNK: Mr. Duff : I'm hungry for a chocolate cupcake.
Izzie : - What did you say? - A chocolate cupcake.
UNK: Mr. Duff : One of those fudgey things with the white squiggle on the frosting.
UNK: Mr. Duff : Could you oblige?
Izzie : What, do I still have some chocolate on my face
Izzie : or in my hair or something?
Meredith : - What are you talking about? - You.
Izzie : I know the drill, so keep it up.
Izzie : Next you'll be reading my cards, telling me my dead uncle is in the room.
UNK: Mr. Duff : - Is he? - I don't have a dead uncle.
Izzie : I'm watching you.
UNK: [Sniffs]
UNK: [Whistling]
George : - If that's turkey, can I have some? - It's soggy.
Alex : - It'll kill you. Solve everything. - I am good at intubations.
Meredith : Why does everything in a hospital smell like a hospital?
Izzie : Don't be so hard on yourself. Everybody makes mistakes.
George : I'm good at a lot of things.
Cristina : I'm gonna tell you something. You need to get laid.
Cristina : See that nurse over there?
Cristina : She's single. She's got red hair. Go ask her out.
George : - I intubated an esophagus. - Dude, you're tweaking.
Alex : - Maybe you should go see that psychic. - Mr. Duff is not a psychic!
Cristina : I am trying to help you.
Cristina : Go buy her a latte and freshen up your gonad, please.
Cristina : Shut up.
George : It's not too late to call her.
George : You know, moms like that, surprises on their birthdays.
George : You know, it's very Hallmark.
UNK: Mrs. Glass : I'm 47, you know?
UNK: Mrs. Glass : I'm 47 and having a baby, which is kind of a miracle,
UNK: Mrs. Glass : and it kind of sucks, if you see what I mean.
UNK: [Sighs]
UNK: We'd given up on the kid thing about a year ago.
UNK: Mrs. Glass : You know, fertility treatments, acupuncture needles in my eyes.
UNK: Mrs. Glass : Well, not really, but it felt like it.
UNK: It was like, "Screw this. I want my life back."
UNK: Mrs. Glass : Then one awesome night on the beach with a bottle of merlot...
Cristina : I should have these labs back in a couple hours.
UNK: Mrs. Glass : You get it, right?
UNK: Mrs. Glass : My hesitation?
UNK: Mrs. Glass : This isn't an easy decision, I mean.
UNK: Mrs. Glass : I'm having a baby.
Cristina : You have advanced-stage carcinoma.
Cristina : You're 47 years old,
Cristina : so statistically you have a good probability of survival.
Cristina : Forego treatment, chances are you won't see your baby go to kindergarten,
UNK: so whose life are you interested in saving?
Cristina : Excuse me.
UNK: [Mr. Walker] First my legs, then stomach. God.
UNK: Mr. Walker : Doc! Doc, my hands can't move.

Derek : Let me know if you feel this.
Derek : How about that? Here?
