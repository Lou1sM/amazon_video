Burke : She's DNR. Let her go down.
Cristina : Four, five.
Cristina : One, two...
UNK: Male Nurse : Do not resuscitate.
Burke : - It is on her chart. - All right!
Burke : Let her go down.
Burke : Let her go down.
UNK: [Machine flatlining]
UNK: [Woman] Call the lab again.
Cristina : Where are they?
George : He's resecting the prostate, coming up on the distal nerve.
Izzie : You said, "I am not your sister."
Izzie : Do you feel like I was emasculating you?
UNK: No. [sighing] No.
George : I'm too masculine to be emasculated.
UNK: [Chuckling]
Izzie : I'm sorry.
George : Guess you put Dr. Model to rest.
UNK: I guess I did.
Bailey : Dr. Victor, I'm sorry. But these are viable nerves.
UNK: We should save them.
UNK: Dr. Victor : It'll take at least an hour longer, and we might not get it all.
UNK: [Izzie] You know, they call him Limp Harry.
UNK: [Bailey] But his prognosis with chemo is nearly as good.
Bailey : Frankly, if you're worried about missing your tee time,
Bailey : I'd be more than happy to finish.
Izzie : Dr. Stevens.
UNK: [Victor] Can we help you?
Izzie : I'm sorry, Dr. Bailey. Dr. Victor, I agree with her.
Izzie : You just can't...
Izzie : You have to save the nerves.
George : - What? - The nerves, you have to save them.
UNK: Dr. Bailey : Dr. Stevens, I can handle this.
UNK: Most important is giving the patient what they want.
Izzie : - What Humphrey wants is his erection. - She's yours. You get her out.
UNK: Dr. Bailey : Can't do that, sir.
UNK: Dr. Bailey : You know how these young puppies are.
UNK: Dr. Victor : I'm going to tell Richard about both of you.
UNK: Dr. Bailey : You do that. In the meantime,
UNK: Dr. Bailey : let's pretend it's you on this table and give this a try.
UNK: [- Tegan and Sara : Where Does the Good Go?]
Burke : Dr. Pinosky.
Burke : You ever called one?
MVO : No.
UNK: Chief Webber : Call it, doctor.
UNK: Time of death, 11 : 43.
UNK: [Meredith] I wish there were a rule book for intimacy.
UNK: Some kind of a guide
UNK: that could tell you when you've crossed the line.
Burke : You can't lose it like that.
UNK: [Meredith] It would be nice if you could see it coming.
Cristina : I'll get her.
UNK: - [Sighing] - Let her go.
UNK: [Meredith] And I don't know how you fit it on a map.
Burke : We have to let her go.
Bailey : Of course, now you know every time he gets a rise,
Bailey : he'll be thinking of you.
UNK: [Meredith] You take it where you can get it...
UNK: ... and keep it as long as you can.
UNK: [Meredith] And as for rules...
George : Better not be using my toothbrush.
Cristina : I'm not.
UNK: Maybe there are none.
UNK: Maybe the rules of intimacy
UNK: are something you have to define for yourself.
