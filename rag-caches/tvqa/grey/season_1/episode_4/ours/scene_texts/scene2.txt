Bailey : Is he prepped?
Izzie : I think they're doing it right now.
Bailey : You think?
Bailey : He's having a prostate biopsy.
Bailey : Trust me. If you'd been in there, you'd know.
Bailey : OK, Mr. Humphrey. We're gonna get started.
UNK: Mr. Humphrey : Get her out of here.
UNK: Mr. Humphrey : I want her out of here! Just get her out of here!
UNK: Mr. Humphrey : Just you go! Now! Just go now!
Bailey : Hey, relax! Relax, Mr. Humphrey.
UNK: [Sona] Will he be able to see again?
Meredith : We won't know until the nails come out.
Sona : Did he tell you he takes photos?
Sona : Beautiful photos. It's his hobby.
Sona : I just got him a new digital camera, and now he can't stop, you know?
Sona : He always has it out, always taking pictures of me.
Meredith : Jorge said he's been having headaches.
Meredith : Can you tell me about them? Have they been recent?
Scene : Um...
Sona : I'm not sure. Maybe the last couple of months.
Meredith : Have you seen him experience any dizziness or disorientation?
Sona : Yes, yes, I have.
Izzie : OK.
Bailey : You want to tell me what that was all about?
Jorge : Nothing.
Izzie : He's probably just crazy or something.
Izzie : Bethany Whisper.
George : - What? - Bethany Whisper.
Izzie : I did a new Bethany Whisper lingerie ad.
Izzie : - He saw it in a magazine. - You got time to pose for magazines?
Izzie : No, the shoot was last year. It just came out.
Bailey : - So because he saw you in a thong... - It wasn't a thong.
UNK: ...you're hiding in the hallway.
Izzie : Might be easier if you assign another intern.
Bailey : Easy is not in your job description. You are a doctor. He is a patient.
Bailey : He's your patient. Biopsy these.
Bailey : If they come back positive, I expect to see you in surgery.
Bailey : Hey, you're on this. You understand me?
Derek : - Vertiginous or light-headedness? - Light-headed.
Meredith : Sometimes he'd have to brace himself to get out of bed.
Derek : Could be a million things. Simple orthostasis.
George : What?
UNK: What made him fall with a nail gun?
Derek : He said he tripped.
UNK: Just because you hear hoofbeats, don't assume zebras.
Meredith : Something caused him to lose consciousness and fall down the stairs.
Meredith : He could have a tumor.
Derek : Look, I have no idea why this guy's still alive,
Derek : let alone moving and talking.
Derek : Not a clue. Let's just get him through this
Derek : before we start digging around for something else.
UNK: - Shepherd. Twenty-three cases? - One was attempted suicide.
Derek : - Doesn't count. Talk about procedure. - Problems : Bleeding and infection.
George : Odds improved with shorter surgery.
Alex : Bottom line was get them out quickly and watch for bleeding.
Derek : I got it. Other words, I'm on my own.
George : You coming?
Alex : Dude, I don't need an escort.
George : Go.
Alex : Go ahead.
UNK: [Receiver clicking]
Alex : Well, well, well.
Alex : Dr. Bethany Whisper.
Alex : That's so nice.
UNK: [Whistling]
UNK: [Humming]
Jorge : She had this thing for red when we met.
Jorge : Red car, red dresses, red hats.
Jorge : Personally, I hated the color. Too obvious, you know?
Jorge : But a couple years ago, I took her up to the mountains.
Jorge : She was in a red dress,
Jorge : and there was this field of red...
Jorge : ...poppies, I think.
Jorge : And she jumped out of the car
Jorge : and ran into them
Jorge : and started laughing...
Jorge : ...laughing at all the red.
