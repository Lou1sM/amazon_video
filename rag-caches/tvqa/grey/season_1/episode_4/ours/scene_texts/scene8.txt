Derek : What the hell are you doing?
Meredith : - She needs to understand. - I do understand.
Sona : You think that I'm being selfish, that I don't want to give him up.
UNK: George yelling : - I don't. - This is Jorge's decision.

Cristina : - We lost pulse. - Let her go.
Cristina : - Where's that epi? - Let her go!
