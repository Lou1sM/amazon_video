Bailey : The good news is it hasn't spread from his prostate to his lymph nodes.
UNK: Dr. Victor : With a radical prostatectomy, we could probably get it all.
UNK: Dr. Victor : - Good prognosis. - Spare some nerves?
UNK: Give him a chance at a normal sex life?
UNK: Dr. Victor : Young puppies like to take chances with cancer.
UNK: Dr. Victor : Old dogs like me, we do what works.
Bailey : Yes, sir, of course.
UNK: Dr. Victor : - We on the schedule tomorrow? - 10 : 00am.
UNK: Dr. Victor : Good. Maybe I can squeeze in a round.
Bailey : An ass who deals in asses.
Bailey : We call him "Limp Harry." He never spares the nerves.
UNK: [Richard] As you can see, the patient has shot seven nails
UNK: Chief Webber : directly into the skull without doing significant damage
UNK: Chief Webber : other than the optic nerve, and we may be able to save that.
UNK: Chief Webber : The idea is to remove the nails
UNK: Chief Webber : at exactly the angle they entered.
UNK: Chief Webber : Any wiggle, and we risk
UNK: Chief Webber : doing more damage than when they went in.
Cristina : Where are they? Move over.
George : They're just pulling them out.
George : Hey, I heard you got a Whipple.
Cristina : A maybe Whipple.
Cristina : Burke is running my butt off.
Cristina : Oh, man. Look at those films!
UNK: [Laughing]
Alex : It's Hellraiser.
UNK: [Woman] Maybe try to an 87.
UNK: [Man] Small increase, then it will stabilize.
Derek : - Gelfoam. - Here you go.
Cristina : There goes the third grade.
UNK: [Burke] Dr. Yang...
Burke : ...did you put in the blood work?
Cristina : Oh, right before I got here.
Burke : Hmm. Take her to Radiology for the MRI.
Burke : Beep me when you're done.
UNK: [Sighing]
Burke : You want the Whipple, right?
George : Yeah.
UNK: [Door opening]
Bailey : - Hey. - Hey.
Izzie : Here. My share of the grocery money.
Izzie : - When are you going? - Tonight.
Izzie : Seriously, George. Please don't...
George : Yeah, could we not talk about it here?
Izzie : What, tampons?
George : Did you not hear a word I said?
Izzie : You're a man. We know.
Alex : Talk about shrinking the salamander.
UNK: I always divided surgeons into two categories :
UNK: Those that remember the names of their patients
UNK: and those who didn't.
UNK: They all remember their surgeries, of course.
UNK: Every damn suture.
Cristina : But the good ones remember the names, right?
Liz : I didn't say that.
Liz : Now, some of the best ones,
Meredith : you know, distance themselves on purpose.
Liz : They believe that the personal stuff clouds the medicine.
Woman : - Hi, Liz. - Hey.
Cristina : But? I'm waiting for the "but."
Cristina : I'm sure there's a big, fat qualifier coming.
Man : - Hey, Liz. - Hey!
Man : Looking good.
Liz : Oh, you liar.
UNK: Man 2 : How you doing, honey?
Liz : Oh, fabulous. Just fabulous.
Man : - Hey, Liz. - [Liz] Hey.
Man : Hey, Liz.
Derek : - Bleeding? - It's clean.
Derek : All right. Way to go, team.
Derek : Good job, everybody. Thank you.
UNK: [Derek] I don't think we made it worse.
Derek : The big question is the optic nerve.
Derek : We'll know in the morning.
Meredith : Should I order the MRI?
Derek : He needs to stabilize. We'll do it tomorrow.
UNK: [Man] One of the most amazing things I ever saw.
Cristina : Is it over? Hey, is it over?
UNK: Man 2 : Yeah, it's over.
UNK: Cristina loudly : Hey, does Burke have a Whipple scheduled?
UNK: [Cristina] I wanted to know if you've seen Fallon's labs.
Sona : - I have. - They're getting worse.
Cristina : The stent doesn't seem to be helping her jaundice.
UNK: [Burke] No.
Cristina : - Should we be doing something? - We are.
Cristina : You didn't have the Whipple on the board. Want me to schedule it for you?
Burke : I want to see the results of her biopsy, and have a look at her overnight labs.
Cristina : - Overnight? - You're on-call, right?
UNK: Um... Sure, yeah.
Burke : Well, good. Stick with her.
UNK: You're doing the surgery, right? Y-you're still doing the Whipple?
Burke : The woman has pancreatic cancer, Dr. Yang.
Burke : We're gonna do something.
