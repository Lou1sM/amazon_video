George : Naked. I am naked in the shower.
Izzie : They're just tampons, George. I really needed tampons.
George : God!
Izzie : I'm not riding in the same car with him.
Meredith : Unless you're going like that, you're not riding with me.
Meredith : - Where are the tampons? - He didn't buy them.
UNK: [Meredith] You didn't buy them?
George : Men don't buy tampons.
Izzie : You are gonna have to get over the man thing, George.
