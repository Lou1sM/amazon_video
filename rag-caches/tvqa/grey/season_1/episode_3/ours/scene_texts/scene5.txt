Cristina : I had a radiologist look at his chest. He has a traumatic aortic injury.
UNK: - He's gonna rupture and bleed out. - He needs surgery.
UNK: - If he's gonna remain an organ donor. - If he's gonna live.
UNK: Meredith VO : - Izzie... - No, I'm not giving up on him.
UNK: He has surgery, he lives. That's the point.
UNK: I'm going to find the family. You get him into surgery.
UNK: She's vice president of Fantasyland.
Meredith : So who do we go to for the surgery. Bailey?
Cristina : We need to go higher than Bailey.
Meredith : Dr. Burke.
UNK: - Hello! - OK.
UNK: [Sighing]
Cristina : Dr. Burke, um, I know you're busy,
Cristina : but our John Doe needs an aortic repair.
Burke : The guy from this morning?
Burke : Isn't he legally dead?
Cristina : Well, yeah... He's kinda still around.
UNK: We gave him two units PRVCs and put him on pressors.
Burke : On whose orders?
UNK: [Meredith] Mine.
UNK: You get a brain-dead John Doe a blood transfusion without consulting anyone.
Burke : And now you want me to repair his heart?
Cristina : Well, yes.
Burke : You do enjoy crossing the line, don't you?
Meredith : He is an excellent candidate for organ donation.
Burke : I am a surgeon. I save lives.
Burke : This guy is already dead.
Burke : Now, this is the men's room.
Burke : Either whip one out, or close the door.
Derek : - You're asking my advice? - Yes.
Derek : Now who's chasing?
Meredith : - Not funny. This is important. - OK.
Derek : You want to get around Burke?
Derek : You gotta find a way to get the chief involved.
George : What'd I do?
Meredith : How close a match for the liver is your guy to our John Doe?
George : Very. Same type, same size. Couldn't find a better match. Why?
Izzie : He's the chief's VIP, right?
Derek : Right.
Cristina : How much would you kill to be in on the transplant surgery?
George : You underestimate me.
George : I'm not a baby. I'm your colleague. You don't have to manipulate me.
George : If you want something, all you have to do is ask.
Izzie : We want you to go over Burke's head, to the chief.
George : Ask me something easier.
George : Sir.
Webber : - O'Malley. How's Mackie? - Fine.
George : Actually, that's what I want to talk to you about.
UNK: I kinda think that... Me and the other interns... We think...
Webber : O'Malley, I'm not getting any younger.
George : We found Mackie a liver.
UNK: [Meredith] We are so going to hell.
UNK: - Burke is sending us to hell. - On an express train.
Izzie : If it works.
Bailey : What are you doing?
UNK: [All] Nothing.
UNK: Yes!
UNK: [Laughing]
Cristina : Oh, crap.
Alex : Dr. Burke! Dr. Burke!
UNK: [Monitor beeping]
UNK: [Alex] Excellent work, sir.
Webber : Excellent.
Burke : Flawless.
UNK: It's a shame he's brain-dead.
UNK: If he wasn't, he would be on his feet in a few days.
UNK: I'm amazed at what's going on.
Cristina : I seriously hate that guy.
Meredith : Alex is vermin. That surgery is ours.
UNK: [Izzie] At least Burke is doing the surgery.
Izzie : I don't care about Alex.
UNK: George, you did good.
UNK: I'm gonna have to dodge Burke for the rest of my career.
George : He could kill me and make it look like an accident.
UNK: [Door opening]
Woman : The police called. They've identified your John Doe.
Woman : His wife is on the way.
UNK: [All sigh]
UNK: [Monitor beeping]
UNK: Oh, my God. [exhales]
UNK: Kevin!
UNK: - [Derek] It's OK. - [Woman] Oh, my God!
UNK: Mrs. Davidson, this is Dr. Stevens.
UNK: Now, if you have any questions at all, please call me.
UNK: Is there?
Woman : Is there still a chance?
Izzie : We can hold off till morning,
Izzie : but if there's still no change, we'd...
Izzie : We'd like to talk to you about organ donation.
UNK: [Monitor continues beeping]
UNK: [Richard] Mackie?
Mackie : Mmm.
UNK: How are we treating ya?
Mackie : Oh, fine.
Mackie : Except that beautiful boy won't let me smoke.
UNK: [Mackie] You should reprimand him.
Mackie : Make him change bedpans.
UNK: [Laughing]
Webber : Mackie.
