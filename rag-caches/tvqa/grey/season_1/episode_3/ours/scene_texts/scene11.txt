UNK: [Door opening]
Cristina : Izzie?
UNK: I'm gonna sew him up, for his family.
Cristina : You do it.
Izzie : - What? - You do it.
Izzie : Mrs. Davidson.
Izzie : He's ready, if you'd like to see him.
UNK: [Sighs]
UNK: [Laughing]
UNK: [Bailey] This lovely group's his friends.
Bailey : Uh, you all belong to... What's his name?
Meredith : - Viper. - V... Viper.
UNK: [Man] Yeah, we were in the race.
UNK: How is he? Is he OK?
UNK: Is he OK?
UNK: No. No, he's not OK at all.
Bailey : He hurled his body down a concrete mountain
Bailey : at full speed for no good reason.
UNK: [Scoffing]
Bailey : Yeah, I know you all pierce yourselves, smoke up
Bailey : and generally treat your bodies
Bailey : like your grungy asses can't break down. That's fine.
Bailey : You want to kill yourselves flying down a concrete mountain,
Bailey : go to it. But there are other people walking, people driving,
UNK: people trying to live their lives on that concrete mountain.
Bailey : One of them got his brains scrambled 'cause
UNK: one of you little sniveling no-good snot rags...
Derek : - Dr. Bailey. - Yeah, so. OK, no.
Bailey : Your friend, Viper, as far as I'm concerned, is not OK.
UNK: [Man exhaling]
Meredith : She's, um...
Meredith : ...really tired.
UNK: [Meredith] But...
UNK: ...Viper's gonna make it. He's gonna live.
UNK: - [Man 1] Cool. Thanks. - [Man 2] Thanks.
UNK: [- Lisa Loeb : Fools Like Me]
Derek : It's not the chase.
Izzie : - What? - You and me.
Derek : It is not the thrill of the chase.
Derek : It's not a game.
UNK: [Sighing] It's...
Derek : It's your tiny, ineffectual fists.
Derek : And your hair.
Meredith : - My hair? - It smells good.
Derek : And you're very, very bossy.
Derek : Keeps me in line.
Meredith : I'm still not going out with you.
Derek : You say that now.
UNK: - [monitor beeping] - How'd it go?
Webber : Very smoothly.
Meredith : Damn.
UNK: That means I'm gonna have to quit smoking.
UNK: Ah, the pretty ones always come crawling back.
UNK: [Meredith] There's another way to survive this competition.
UNK: A way no one ever seems to tell you about.
UNK: One you have to learn for yourself.
UNK: Number five :
UNK: It's not about the race. At all.
UNK: There are no winners or losers.
UNK: Victories are counted by the number of lives saved.
UNK: [Cristina] Oh, OK. This is the best part. Watch.
UNK: She pulls the flap of skin down over the face.
Man : - We were... - Hi.
UNK: We were... we were just, uh...
George : Cristina made us.
UNK: [Meredith] And, once in a while, if you're smart,
UNK: the life you save could be your own.
Meredith : What are we watching?
UNK: Ooh. This is the one where my mother...
Izzie : - Literally pulls this guy's face off. - Yeah.
UNK: - Oh, come on! - Holy crap!
