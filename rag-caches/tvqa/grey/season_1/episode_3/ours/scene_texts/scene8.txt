Mackie : I owe you, George.
George : No, you don't owe me anything.
George : I'm just happy we found a liver.
Mackie : Well, when I get out of here,
Mackie : how about I take you and my new liver out for a night on the town?
Mackie : What do you say?
George : Uh, Mr. Mackie, no offense or anything.
George : You're very handsome, but, I, um, I'm not...
George : I mean, you're not my type because...
UNK: You're a man, and...
UNK: [chuckling] George, I never thought you were gay.
George : - You didn't? - Oh, child, please. You? Gay?
Mackie : I'm sick, George, not blind.
UNK: But then, why have?
Mackie : Because dying is a "get out of jail free" card.
Mackie : I can be as bold as I want,
Mackie : and there's nothing anybody can say about it.
Mackie : So I flirt.
UNK: Haven't you been attracted to someone you know you couldn't have?
Webber : Well...
Derek : I'm...
Bailey : No.
UNK: What's her name?
George : There's no...
UNK: Mr Mackie : I'm not...
UNK: [laughing] You know...
George : This is really...
George : ...not...
Izzie : Meredith.
UNK: Hmm.
Izzie : Meredith.
UNK: [Inhaling] To be young and in love.
UNK: Let's go get that liver, shall we?
UNK: No, I'm sorry, I...
George : I didn't...
UNK: [sighing]
Burke : I never liked harvesting.
Meredith : Why?
Burke : Like I said, I'm a surgeon. I save lives.
Burke : This ends one.
Izzie : I know you tried, so no hard feelings, OK.
Izzie : - I was just... - You were saying goodbye.
Meredith : What's Viper doing here?
Alex : Probably crashed his bike. Again.
Meredith : How long has he been waiting?
George : I don't know.
UNK: I've been busy on real cases.
Alex : He's all yours.
Meredith : Viper.
Meredith : Viper?
UNK: Are you OK?
UNK: [Coughing]
Meredith : Viper!
UNK: - [Meredith] Oh! - [Gasping]
UNK: Call the OR, tell them we're coming, and page Dr. Bailey.
UNK: Alex, let's go.
UNK: Alex, push the damn gurney!
UNK: - [Nurse] Clear the way. Coming through. - Somebody get the elevator.
Meredith : I don't know how long I can keep this wound closed.
UNK: Move faster. Damn it!
UNK: [Elevator bell dings]
UNK: This a new one?
Bailey : Somebody get her off my patient.
UNK: Meredith, get cleaned up and scrub in. Alex, back downstairs.
Alex : Yeah, but I helped.
Bailey : They tell me down in the pit, you only wanna take the hot cases.
