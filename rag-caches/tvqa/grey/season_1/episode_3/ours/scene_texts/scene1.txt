George : Well, whatever you need, I'm your man.
George : Just name it.
Webber : Well...
UNK: Mr Mackie : I'm sure I'll think of something.
UNK: - [machine beeping] - Absent corneal reflexes.
UNK: It's been 55 minutes.
UNK: If he doesn't respond to tests in the next five hours, what?
UNK: We stand here and watch him die?
UNK: [Cristina] If he doesn't respond to tests,
Cristina : it's because he's already dead.
UNK: [Scoffing] Technically. Legally.
Cristina : - Actually, Izzie. Actually dead. - He's breathing. He has a heartbeat.
Cristina : Look at his EEG. There's no higher-brain function.
Cristina : He'll never talk, move or think again.
Cristina : There's no one in there. Think like a doctor, Izzie.
Izzie : He could wake up. What about a miracle?
UNK: [Izzie] There are medical miracles, you know.
Derek : I know. You're right, miracles happen.
UNK: [Derek] People do wake up.
Derek : That's why we do a series of tests over a number of hours.
Derek : So when we call time of death,
Derek : we know that we've done everything to make sure
Derek : it's actually his time of death.
UNK: That there isn't gonna be any miracles.
Derek : This is the hard part.
Derek : To stand around as surgeons and not cut.
UNK: That's what "do no harm" means.
UNK: I wish he'd just go into the light already so I can get on another case.
Cristina : Oh, I'm the devil because I'd rather be in surgery
Cristina : instead of standing watch over the death squad?
Cristina : It's depressing.
Izzie : Look at his sneakers. They're brand-new.
Izzie : And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt.
Izzie : And he has one of those electronic key cards.
Izzie : He belongs to someone.
Izzie : An hour ago, he was out there, alive.
Izzie : To simply stand here and wait for him to die...
UNK: - It would be a waste of life. - Exactly.
UNK: It'd be a waste of organs.
UNK: Ahh. You've got a nice touch.
UNK: [Sighs] And, by the way, you are a rockin' babe.
