Nurse : We have a pulse.
UNK: [Izzie panting]
UNK: OK, follow with suction.
UNK: [Shepherd] How's it going?
Burke : It's more intertwined than the studies made it look.
UNK: [Bailey] I need another bag. Call the blood bank.
Bailey : We need more O-negative.
Burke : I'm down 10 units of blood, and I haven't even flipped her yet.
Derek : Oh, wow.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Hold it steady.
Derek : Look at that.
Nurse : Sponge.
Derek : How am I supposed to get around that artery?
UNK: Let me call down and see...
George : OK.
Derek : All right, then. Forceps.
UNK: Here you go.
Burke : Excuse me.
Meredith : God, it's unbelievable.
Meredith : Right.
Meredith : How did she live like that?
Alex : Watch what you say. You never know who's listening.
UNK: [Laughing]
Alex : Look at George.
Alex : He looks like he's about to fall in.
Meredith : Are you really as shallow and callous as you seem?
Alex : Oh, you want to go out for a drink later
Alex : and hear about my secret pain?
Meredith : Does that line ever work for you?
MVO : Sometimes.
Cristina : Oh.
Meredith : Must be because you look like that.
Annie : Like what?
UNK: [Chuckling] So is that a yes?
MVO : No.
Meredith : I can't. I'm seeing someone.
Alex : Look, if you don't want to go out with me, just say so.
Alex : No need to lie.
Meredith : Oh, OK.
Meredith : Well, I don't want to go out with you.
Meredith : But I think I really might be seeing someone.
UNK: [Woman] Yeah. No, it's up here.
UNK: It's up here. It's up here.
UNK: We're still in the middle of surgery.
Izzie : Mr. Harper, the post-op heart patient in 2114.
Izzie : I had to open his sternotomy bedside.
Burke : - You what? - [All] What?
Meredith : What?
UNK: He had cardiac tamponade.
Izzie : His chest films were clean this morning. It happened fast.
Izzie : He was in PEA. There was no time.
Derek : Go ahead. I got it.
Derek : We're OK here. Yeah, I need some retraction.
Derek : - Pull back on the retractor. - I got it.
Alex : You opened a heart bedside, and you couldn't even page me?
Alex : Needed all the glory for yourself, right?
Izzie : I paged you 50 times.
Izzie : Do you have any idea what I have been through?
Alex : Oh, man. The battery. I forgot to change it.
Izzie : You forgot? You forgot?!
Izzie : You are hateful!
Izzie : You are a hateful, hateful, lazy,
Izzie : arrogant, hateful man!
Izzie : Hateful!
Derek : Never a dull moment here at Seattle Grace.
Derek : - Oh! - Oh, my God.
Derek : Get right in there.
Bailey : She can't afford to lose this much blood.
Derek : Get me some suction. I can't see what I'm doing.
Derek : Clamp, clamp, clamp, please.
Derek : Is there any blood in the rapid infuser?
Nurse : We're waiting on two units.
Derek : What do you mean, waiting?
Bailey : We didn't anticipate this blood loss.
UNK: We prepped double. We've used it all.
Derek : - What did you cut? - [Bailey] Nothing. It just blew.
Alex : She came in with too much damage.
Bailey : The artery walls are too weak.
Alex : Annie, come on.
Bailey : - Ten units of O-negative. - I cannot see.
UNK: Give me your hand. Push down here. Pull it towards you. Suction!
Nurse : The pressure's dropping.
Derek : Where the hell is the blood?!
Derek : Somebody grab that. Push it back, George. Come on.
UNK: [All panting]
Derek : Oh, God. Just squeeze it off right there.
Derek : Here we go.
