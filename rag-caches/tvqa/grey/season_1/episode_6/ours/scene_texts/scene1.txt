Meredith : Intraspinal catheter.
Meredith : That way, he can have constant pain medication.
Derek : Excellent. This is Dr. Grey.
Derek : She's gonna prep you for the procedure and assist.
UNK: [Pager beeping]
Burke : Excuse me.
Bailey : You make yourselves busy, I'll catch up with you.
UNK: [Woman] I'll see you over there.
Derek : Miranda.
Bailey : Excuse me?
Derek : Well, that's your name, right? It's on your jacket.
UNK: All right, I'll just call you Bailey then.
Bailey : You think you're charming in that talented, neurotic,
Bailey : overly moussed hair sort of way, good for you.
Bailey : But if you think I'm going to stand back
Bailey : and watch while you favor her...
Derek : - I don't favor her. She's good. - I'm sure she is.
Derek : Can I point out that, technically, I'm your boss?
Bailey : You don't scare me.
Bailey : Look, I'm not going to advertise
Bailey : your extracurricular activities with my intern.
Bailey : However, the next time I see you favoring Meredith Grey in any way,
Bailey : I'll make sure she doesn't see the inside of an OR for a month.
Bailey : Just for the sake of balance.
UNK: [Elevator bell dings]
UNK: CT Tech : - We're all set, doc. - OK.
Alex : There's going to be a microphone in there for you
Alex : in case you get scared
Alex : or you want to get out, but try not to do that,
Alex : because then we're going to have to start all over again.
Annie : I'm fine. I'll be fine.
Alex : I know you're going to be fine,
Alex : because I'm going to be right over there, waiting for you.
Alex : - All right? - OK.
Alex : You ready?
Alex : Are you really ready? Let's do this.
UNK: - [Machine buzzing] - See ya.
Alex : Oh, hey, man, you got an extra battery?
UNK: CT Tech : Unbelievable.
UNK: - Oh, I know, right? - I've never seen anything like this.
UNK: CT Tech : God.
Alex : Well, what I don't understand...
UNK: [over speaker]... is how a person lets it get like that.
UNK: I mean, man, that is a whole lot of nasty.
UNK: [Man] Maybe she's afraid of doctors. Poor thing.
UNK: [Alex] Poor thing? Please.
UNK: If you're afraid of doctors, you take a pill.
Alex : She's just sick, like, warped, you know?
UNK: Seriously, I don't know how she lives with herself.
UNK: [Laughing] Ugh.
UNK: Mrs. Connors : Well, at first, we thought she was just putting on weight.
UNK: Mrs. Connors : When we realized what was happening,
UNK: Mrs. Connors : I tried to get her to go to the doctor,
UNK: Mrs. Connors : but she was scared.
UNK: Mrs. Connors : And, the bigger it got, the less she wanted to go.
UNK: Mrs. Connors : And she never really felt all that sick until last night.
UNK: Mrs. Connors : She couldn't breathe.
Cristina : Because the tumor was crushing her lungs.
UNK: Mrs. Connors : Yes, well, I called 911.
UNK: Mrs. Connors : It just seemed like the right thing to do.
Cristina : You know, the right thing to do would have been to call a year ago.
Burke : Thank you.
UNK: [Meredith] OK, Mr. Levangie.
Meredith : We're going to get you more comfortable, OK?
Meredith : I'm going to go downstairs, and I'll be back up shortly.
UNK: - [Grunting] OK. - OK.
UNK: [Woman over PA] Cardiac perfusionist, 4217.
Burke : Excuse me.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : - I'm sorry, doctor... - Grey.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : My dad seems to like you.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : He's always liked skinny blondes.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : Is that rude? I'm sorry. I'm so tired.
Meredith : Is there something?
UNK: Ms. Levangie : I was wondering if you would talk to him.
Meredith : About?
UNK: Ms. Levangie : Brain surgery.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : The doctor mentioned it, and I've read about it online.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : If it worked, it could help
UNK: Ms. Levangie : with most of his symptoms, not just his pain.
Meredith : Is he a candidate?
UNK: Ms. Levangie : He is, but he's afraid of it.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : Surgery on his back, he can understand, but his brain...
UNK: Ms. Levangie : And there are risks.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : - But his quality of life... - There isn't any.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : And, it keeps getting worse.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : I'm getting married next month.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : I already lost my mom.
UNK: Ms. Levangie : And I want him to walk...
UNK: Ms. Levangie : I want him with me. Maybe that's selfish, but...
UNK: Ms. Levangie : You don't know what it's like having a parent...
UNK: Ms. Levangie : Watching him...
MVO : I do.
Meredith : I do know what it's like.
Meredith : I'll see what I can do.
Burke : Thanks.
Meredith : You're welcome.
