UNK: Mr. Levangie : Where's blondie?
Meredith : I'm right here. Can't you see me?
UNK: Mr. Levangie : I'm shaky. I'm not blind.
UNK: Mr. Levangie : Anything goes wrong here, I'm blaming you.
Meredith : OK, in that case, I'll stay where you can see me.
UNK: [Woman] We have to drill a hole and try to find
Meredith : the spot that controls the motor function.
UNK: Mr. Levangie : You can't see my brain from there.
UNK: Mr. Levangie : Aren't you supposed to be learning something?
Meredith : I'm good, right here.
UNK: - [Woman] EEG waves look good. - OK, Mr. Levangie.
Derek : Just take a couple deep breaths.
Derek : - Focus on the pretty girl. - [Whirring]
UNK: [Derek] This is going to sound really scary, but try and relax.
Derek : You shouldn't feel a thing.
Izzie : - Any pain here? Here? - No.
UNK: - OK. - [pager beeping]
Tyler : Dr. Stevens, I need you to check the x-ray in 2103.
Tyler : 2118 needs post-op notes, and Jane's wondering
Tyler : if you want her to start feeding 2112.
Tyler : I'm going on break.
Izzie : OK, yeah, before you do that,
Izzie : could you page Dr. Karev again?
Tyler : - I already paged him. - Again?
UNK: - [man] Irrigation. - [woman] Little more pressure.
Burke : Excuse me. How is it?
UNK: [Man] Long and slow. I don't envy those two.
Doctor : They've been holding that thing for eight hours.
Doctor : Their arms have to be ready to fall off.
UNK: [Burke] Look at the size of this artery.
Bailey : My God.
Bailey : It's as thick as a thumb.
Bailey : You ever seen a vessel this size?
MVO : No.
Burke : This thing's just feeding on all her blood.
Bailey : We need more O-negative.
UNK: [Woman] I'll call the blood bank.
UNK: [Clinking]
UNK: [Burke] Damn it, O'Malley. You want me to kill this patient?
George : No, I... Sorry.
Burke : I mean, is the art of retracting just too much for you?
George : No, I was, uh...
Cristina : Um...
George : I had an itch.
Doctor : Way to go, George. Nicely done.
Doctor : Just keep trying, Mr. Levangie. Mimic my motions.
Doctor : You can do it.
Meredith : You're doing great, Mr. Levangie. Just a little longer.
UNK: Mr. Levangie : Oh, damn it!
Doctor : Take a breath and try again.
Doctor : One more time, Mr. Levangie.
Meredith : The probe is almost in.
Meredith : You'll know it when we find the right spot.
UNK: [Woman] Well, how about that?
UNK: [Derek] There it is.
UNK: Mr. Levangie : I'll be a son of a bitch.
UNK: [Derek] Bailey was on the warpath. I was trying to protect you.
Meredith : You trying to protect me is why she's on the warpath.
Meredith : You can't ask me to scrub in, when I haven't earned it.
Derek : OK, OK.
Meredith : You can't treat me like crap when I haven't earned that.
Meredith : I can take care of myself.
Meredith : I got myself into this mess, and I...
Derek : And you'll get yourself out?
Meredith : I don't... know that yet.
UNK: [Pager beeping]
Meredith : Don't let me keep you.
Derek : You did great work here today.
Meredith : Dr. Shepherd.
Derek : Yeah?
Meredith : Sorry I called you a jackass.
Cristina : You didn't.
Meredith : I did. Twice.
