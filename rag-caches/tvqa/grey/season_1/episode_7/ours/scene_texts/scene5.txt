UNK: [Digby] You really think my ideas are crazy?
Burke : I'm leaning that way.
Alex : We wrestle, he plays trumpet.
Digby : Hey, I feel pretty dizzy.
Burke : You've lost some blood.
UNK: [Digby] This, too, shall pass.
George : Hey...
Digby : How come I don't see you down at the Mat in Belltown?
Alex : Oh, man, no time.
Digby : Bro, make time.

Alex : I'm there.
UNK: [Whimpers]
Bailey : Handle with care. This thing's...
Meredith : Full of gunk. I know.
Bailey : We need to free the bowel from the adhesions
Bailey : caused from the abscess.
Bailey : This poor girl.
Bailey : What was she thinking?
Meredith : She wants her mother's approval. She wanted to please her.
Bailey : And this damage is the result?
Bailey : Here, resect that.
Meredith : Needle-tip Bovie, please.
Bailey : When you're done here, you have postops waiting.
Meredith : I know, Dr. Bailey.
Bailey : Cristina's got the flu. You need to pick up the slack.
Meredith : Look, I'll mop the floors, OK?
Meredith : Sorry, that was inappropriate.
Bailey : It's not the only thing that's inappropriate.
Bailey : You care to tell me what you think you're doing?
Meredith : I'll jump through hoops if you want me to.
UNK: But what I do when I leave this hospital is my business.
Bailey : Half this hospital knows.
Bailey : Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here.
Meredith : I made a choice, and I know you don't respect me for that choice.
Meredith : But I'll live with the consequences.
Bailey : Then I'll have lots of hoops for you to jump through.
Meredith : I've done everything you've asked me to do.
Meredith : I may not do it your way, but it gets done.
Meredith : So whatever else you got, bring it on.
UNK: - Ew! - [Laughter]
Bailey : OK, Dr. Grey,
Bailey : now that you've drained the organ,
Bailey : we can attempt to repair it.

UNK: X-ray Tech : Here you go. Triple espresso, not too hot.
Derek : Oh, I love you, seriously.
UNK: Dr. Taylor : Ah, coffee, where would medicine be without it, huh?
Derek : I hope you have a new crossword, Taylor.
Derek : We're gonna be here a while.
UNK: Dr. Taylor : Never go without.
UNK: Dr. Taylor : Big day for you, kid. Congrats.
Izzie : Thanks.
Derek : Hey, princess. You ready to take a nap?
UNK: Dr. Taylor : - Hey, look what I got. - Blow bubbles, that's it.
UNK: [Derek] Just breathe in. Oh, that's it.
Derek : - What? - Do you smell?
Derek : Smell what? I have a mask.
Cristina : Uh...
George : I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just?
George : Have you been drinking?
UNK: I beg your pardon?
UNK: - [Derek] What? - [George] Do you smell...
UNK: I... I smell alcohol.
UNK: [Taylor] Where do you get off accusing me of something like that?
Derek : George, you're out of line.
George : There are rules. You know, there are rules for a reason.
Derek : You ju...
George : There is a 2-year-old girl on this table.
George : You shouldn't take advantage of someone else's vulnerability.
UNK: Dr. Taylor : I don't need some punk intern telling me what's at stake here.

UNK: [Taylor] Shep?
Derek : You're out, George.
