Claire : Before you guys start, I know you're mad.
UNK: Mrs. Rice : Disbelief, Claire, just disbelief.
UNK: [Mr. Rice] I'm just concerned.
UNK: Mr. Rice : Where did you get the idea to do this?
Claire : The Internet.
UNK: Mrs. Rice : Honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight.
UNK: [Claire sighs]
Claire : Yeah, I tried that, but...
Claire : It doesn't work for me like it does for you.
UNK: [Mr. Rice] Hey, you don't need to lose weight.
UNK: Mrs. Rice : What are you eating?
UNK: Mrs. Rice : And how much have you been working out?
UNK: Mrs. Rice : Most of the time, when people hit their target weight,
UNK: Mrs. Rice : they have to work to stay there.
Claire : Everyone gains weight in college, Mom.
UNK: It's... it's stressful.
UNK: There's... there's not enough time for exercise.
Claire : I just thought if I wasn't worried about my diet, then...
Claire : I could focus more on my studies.
UNK: Mrs. Rice : So you took yet another shortcut?
UNK: Mrs. Rice : Life doesn't work that way, Claire.
UNK: [Mr. Rice] Tina!
UNK: Mrs. Rice : What? You want to argue this?
UNK: Mrs. Rice : She has so much potential.
UNK: If she would just apply herself...
Meredith : OK, I think we should focus on taking care of your daughter.
Meredith : And, Claire, your parents agree,
Meredith : the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass.
Meredith : No!
Claire : No, it's my body.
Claire : I do not want surgery again. Please?
UNK: There are serious complications.
Meredith : And this is about your health.
Claire : But I'd rather be thin.
UNK: Mrs. Rice : Well, I'm afraid the choice isn't up to you.
Cristina : It's called Rasmussen's encephalitis.
Derek : What it amounts to is that this side of her brain...
UNK: This part's healthy, working perfectly.
Derek : This black part of the brain, this... all of that is dead, or dying.
Derek : The condition has gotten radically worse
Derek : since her CT scans three months ago.
Derek : Left untreated, the disease is gonna kill her.
UNK: Mrs. Hayes : How soon?
UNK: [Derek] Too soon.
UNK: [Mr. Hayes] So is there a cure?
Derek : The treatment requires the diseased portion of her brain
Derek : be removed and sealed off.
UNK: [Derek] See, eventually,
Derek : the spinal fluid will fill the cavity.
UNK: Mr. Hayes : R-Remove? But, I mean, that's...
Derek : Half her brain, yes.
UNK: Mrs. Hayes : Half her brain. That...
UNK: Mrs. Hayes : seems impossible.
UNK: [Derek] Her age makes it possible.
Derek : Her brain's not fully developed, so the remaining neurons will compensate.
UNK: Mr. Hayes : But will she be normal?
Derek : There are risks to any surgery,
Derek : and this is, you know, a major one.
Derek : But if we're successful,
Derek : Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple weeks,
Derek : go on to live a relatively normal life.
Derek : Look, I know this is a lot to digest.
Derek : The important thing is we can save her life.
Derek : Thank you.
Derek : - Dr. O'Malley? - Yes? What?
Derek : If the parents consent,
Derek : I thought you'd like to scrub in on the hemispherectomy.
Derek : Are you in, or not?
George : Uh, in.
Meredith : Good.
UNK: [Elevator dings]
UNK: [George] Yay.
George : I'm scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with Shepherd.
Cristina : Get out! I would kill for that.
George : We're gonna cut out half a girl's brain,
George : and it's going to work.
George : It's outrageous.
George : Almost makes it hard to hate him.
Cristina : - Why do you hate him? - Oh, no reason.
Cristina : You know about him and Meredith?
George : You know?
Cristina : When are you gonna figure out that I know everything?
UNK: She knows.
UNK: - [Izzie] What, about doctor-cest? - It's been going on for, like, ever.
George : - And you didn't tell us? - Ooh, you're a gossip, huh?
George : - I am not! - I am.
George : He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep?
George : Not very responsible.
UNK: Jealous? Sex all night isn't about being responsible.
UNK: No, it's about sex all night.
Izzie : I can't believe you're not more pissed off.
Cristina : Well, she works hard all day. She's good at her job.
Cristina : Why should you care how she unwinds?
Cristina : You like to bake all night. Some people like to drink.
Cristina : Others like a screaming orgasm.
UNK: [Alex] Yeah, we do.
Alex : Forget I said that. Pretend like I'm not here.
UNK: [Alex] Continue.
Derek : You look like you need to be spoon-fed.
Cristina : You look like Alex.
George : Yeah, about drinking, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist...
George : - Do you think he drinks? - Whatever gets you through the day.
George : I mean here, at work. Earlier, I thought I smelled...
George : Do you think?
George : I mean, his patients trust that...
UNK: [sighs]
George : So I should say something, right?
Alex : It's a can of worms, George.
Alex : Weren't we talking about sex, anyway?
George : - Doofus. - Ew.
Digby : This is gonna leave a pretty sexy scar, huh?
