UNK: I prefer we stop meeting like this, Mr. Owens.
Digby : Digby.
Digby : So how's the trumpet playing?
Burke : Very safe, compared to your hobby.
Burke : Getting shot is a little more risky.
Alex : That's kind of the point.
Burke : He's running a fever.
Alex : Due to the extra stress on his body from the gunshot.
Digby : Digby,
Burke : the impact of the bullet on your chest
Burke : fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax.
Digby : That sucks, I guess.
Alex : There's blood in your collapsed lung.
Burke : The price of body art went up.
Digby : Ah, no pain, no gain, right?
UNK: [Burke] That's one way to look at it.
Alex : We have that in common, you docs and me.
UNK: [Burke] Do we?
Digby : Yeah, the way you guys push, push and push.
Digby : When I was wrestling, if you wanted to pin me,
Digby : you was gonna have to kill me.
UNK: [Chuckles] Iowa-style.
UNK: [Digby] Iowa-State-style.
UNK: Mr. Hayes : Back home, we were sworn enemies.
Digby : But in Seattle, man, we're brothers.
UNK: [Chuckles]
UNK: [Coughs]
Digby : So, what are we gonna do about this, um...
Digby : hemopneumo-Jurassics?
Alex : Insert a chest tube to drain the blood, then re-inflate your lung.
Burke : Oh, please... tell me I get to watch.
UNK: Oh, man, Iowa-style.
