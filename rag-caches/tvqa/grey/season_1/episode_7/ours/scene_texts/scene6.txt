Derek : You damn well better be ready, Taylor.
UNK: Dr. Taylor : I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
UNK: [Monitor beeping]
UNK: [Woman] Do you really, seriously want to know why I'm leaving?!
Woman : How about when you started insisting that I quit my job,
UNK: when I made more money than you?
Woman : That should have been the last straw.
Woman : The last straw should have been when I found out those phone calls
Woman : that you kept denying were from other women
Woman : were really coming from your mother!
Woman : This isn't healthy.
Izzie : - Hold still, please. - Don't you dare try to patch this up!
Izzie : Could the both of you please stop?
Woman : You don't love me, JP. You love to smother me.
Woman : And if I could just get you to admit that,
Woman : then I could leave you with an ounce of respect.
Izzie : Athena, I let you stay in here to keep him calm.
UNK: If you're gonna keep...
Athena : Check that. I can't respect a man desperate enough
Athena : to swallow my exit strategy.
Athena : That is the last straw!
Izzie : Michelle, can you get her out of here?
UNK: [Michelle] Ma'am?
Athena : - Fine! - [Choking]
Derek : - Come on. - What?
Athena : What's happening?
Izzie : The keys moved farther down.
Athena : Oh, my God, what does that mean?
Athena : What did you do? Don't you dare die, JP!
Izzie : Please! Please, just shut up!
Athena : Breathe, JP. Just breathe.
UNK: [Grunting]
UNK: [Izzie] Got it.
UNK: [Choking]
UNK: [Gagging]
UNK: [Coughing]
Izzie : Very impressive, JP.
UNK: [Sighs]
Athena : Is he OK? Is he gonna be OK?
Izzie : Yeah, he'll be fine.
UNK: [Panting]
UNK: [JP chuckling]
UNK: You lit... You did that on purpose, didn't you?
UNK: [Sighs] Can I offer you some advice?
Izzie : Get in your car and go, for all of our sakes.
UNK: You're never gonna find where I parked it.
UNK: [Meredith] I need a shower.
Meredith : I need a shower.
Bailey : You need to go tell that girl's parents
Bailey : what kind of kid they're getting back.
Meredith : You're not gonna let me shower first?
Bailey : That would be a hoop, would it not?
Meredith : It would qualify.
Bailey : Shower first, then.
Izzie : Ew, what smells?
Izzie : That would be me, or more specifically,
Meredith : my patient's insides all over me.
Izzie : That makes me strangely happy.
Cristina : Oh, God. Oh, Meredith, you smell like...
Izzie : Karma.
Derek : - What? - Nothing.
UNK: Something vile's stuck in your hair.
Cristina : You know, just go stand over there, please.
Meredith : Ugh, how much do I love being a surgeon right now?
Izzie : Karma.
Meredith : What does karma have to do with anything?
Izzie : I'm just saying, you've been given all the best surgeries.
Izzie : And now you smell like putrid goo.
Izzie : And you're giving off a stench.
Izzie : Karma's a bitch.
UNK: [Bailey] Dr. Shepherd needs an intern.
Bailey : - Which one of you is clear? - Where do you want me?
Bailey : - You need to lie down somewhere. - I'm completely healthy.
Derek : Grey?
UNK: - [Sighs] Of course. - What is your problem?
Izzie : Um, you!
Izzie : 'Cause apparently, you can help Dr. McDreamy
Izzie : in ways the rest of us can't.
Meredith : - You did not just s... - Yes, I did!
UNK: [Bailey] Hey!
Bailey : Hemispherectomy in OR 1 with Dr. Shepherd. Go.
