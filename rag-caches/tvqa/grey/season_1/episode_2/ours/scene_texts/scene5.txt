Man : You're hot.
Izzie : You're drunk. Hold still.
Man : Wait. You're that... that girl from the magazine.
UNK: The red bikini.
Izzie : Yeah, it was pink. I'm done.
Izzie : You can see the nurse outside now.
UNK: [Speaking Chinese]
Man : - Is she crazy or something? - No, I don't think so. OK.
Izzie : Please. Please sit down.
Izzie : I really need to look at your arm.
Meredith : OK.
UNK: [Speaking Chinese]
UNK: What are you doing down here?
UNK: Just sitting here with my penis.
Meredith : - What about you? - Hiding from Alex.
Meredith : I kissed Derek.
UNK: You kissed Derek?
Derek : In the elevator.
UNK: In the elevator?
Meredith : I was having a bad day.
Meredith : I am having a bad day.
UNK: This is what do you do on your bad days,
Cristina : make out with Dr. McDreamy.
Cristina : Well,
Cristina : you know, that and carrying around a penis
Meredith : just makes everything seem so shiny and happy.
UNK: George said Allison was wearing your shoes.
Izzie : Yeah.
Meredith : It's weird, right?
Cristina : It's weird that you care.
Meredith : - I think it's weird. - [Shouting]
UNK: [Tires screeching]
UNK: Could I have Security, please?
UNK: What do we got?
Meredith : - Take a look. - What?
UNK: Let's get him to OR 1. Call the chief.
Bailey : Let him know we got the rapist.
UNK: I saw Allison.
Meredith : You can't believe the beating that she took.
Meredith : And then to see this.
UNK: Like that saying, "You should see the other guy."
UNK: Why not attempt to reattach the penis?
Cristina : Teeth don't slice. You can only reattach with a clean cut.
Cristina : If she wanted to slice him off with a knife...
Meredith : The digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh.
Bailey : So, what do we do?
UNK: Sew him up minus part of the family jewels.
Bailey : And his outlook?
Meredith : He'll be urinating out of a bag for a long time.
Cristina : Not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again.
Meredith : - Too bad. - Shame.
Bailey : Let's all take a moment to grieve.
Bailey : Clamp.
Burke : Richard.
Bailey : We got the rapist.
Webber : He stumbled right into the hospital.
