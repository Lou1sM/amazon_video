UNK: [Cristina] Why do I have to be the one who get hugged?
UNK: [Alex] Because I don't do that.

George : You can't just say no. Come on.

UNK: Other intern : What are you doing in here?
Meredith : There were no tests ordered, and the baby has a murmur.

Meredith : He turned blue.
UNK: You're not authorized to be in here.
Intern : Do you know how much trouble you can get into?
Meredith : Are you going to do any tests?
Intern : It's a benign systolic ejection murmur. It goes away with age.
UNK: - You're not gonna do tests? - He's not your patient.
Intern : - He's not even on your service. - You sure it's benign?
Intern : I'm a doctor, too, you know. You should get out of here.

Meredith : - No. - Why not?
