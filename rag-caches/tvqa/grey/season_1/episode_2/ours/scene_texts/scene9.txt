UNK: I mean, it shouldn't be weird to say this.
UNK: It's just that I used to change her diapers.
Meredith : I get it.
Webber : It just says that it was never out of your sight.
UNK: - One penis. - Yeah.
Webber : Officer.
UNK: [Burke] We'll use a median approach
Burke : for a transventricular repair with a right ventriculotomy.
UNK: Let's open him up. OK.
UNK: Fifteen blade, please.
Izzie : - Grey? - Yes, sir?
UNK: Go scrub in. When we're finished cracking the baby's chest,
Burke : I'll let you hold the clamp.
Meredith : Seriously?
Burke : Don't make me change my mind.
Izzie : I'm going.
UNK: [- Keane : Somewhere Only We Know]
Derek : I have good news and bad news.
Derek : Good news is Dr. Bailey stopped your bleeding.
Derek : The bad news is we're giving your penis to the cops.
Derek : Have a nice life.
UNK: [Cristina] The results of your labs are clean.
UNK: The tumor is benign. You can go home today.
Cristina : Oh, you...
UNK: [Meredith] At some point, you have to make a decision.
UNK: Boundaries don't keep other people out.
UNK: They fence you in.
UNK: Life is messy.
UNK: That's how we're made.
UNK: OK, fine, George and Izzie, you can move into the house.
George : - Yes! - I can't believe you caved!
Meredith : Thank you.
George : Yes!
Meredith : I can't believe I caved.
Cristina : I blame the babies. They make you toxic.
UNK: [Meredith] So you can waste your life drawing lines...
UNK: ... or you can live your life crossing them.
Derek : Welcome back.
UNK: [Meredith] But there are some lines...
Derek : So, it's intense.
Derek : This thing I have for ferryboats, I mean.
UNK: [Meredith]... that are way too dangerous to cross.
Meredith : I'm so taking the stairs this time.
Derek : No self-control.
Derek : It's sad. Really.
UNK: [Meredith] Here's what I know.
UNK: If you're willing to take the chance...
UNK: ... the view from the other side...
UNK: ... is spectacular.
