Burke : Yeah, I heard.
Webber : - Listen, Burke... - Why?
Meredith : You really want to know?
Burke : I want to know when you stopped thinking of me as your number one.
Burke : Richard, I do more in this hospital than...
Webber : You do only exactly as much as is necessary.
Webber : You never take an extra step.
Webber : You never give an extra minute.
Webber : You're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me.
UNK: You want to be chief? Earn it.
UNK: [Speaking Chinese]
Izzie : I'm sorry. I have patients lined up.
Izzie : I don't have time. I don't understand you.
Izzie : I'm sorry.
UNK: [Woman on PA] Dr. Bailey to Ortho, stat.
Alex : - My head hurts. - Maybe it's a tumor.
UNK: You wish I had a tumor.
Cristina : I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in.
UNK: I've been suturing all day.
Izzie : My hands are numb.
UNK: At least you help people.
Alex : At least you get to practice freakin' medicine.
UNK: I had to send my Chinese lady away.
Izzie : She was, like, camped out down there.
Cristina : Oh, poor Izzie, turning away patients. Boohoo.
UNK: The police can't send a crime-scene guy down for hours,
Meredith : so I have to spend the night with the penis.
Meredith : - Alex, don't say it. - It was too easy, anyway.
UNK: [Sighs]
George : Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing?
Alex : Are we supposed to be learning something?
George : I don't feel like I'm learning anything.
Izzie : Except how not to sleep.
Cristina : It's like there's this wall.
Cristina : The attendings and the residents are over there being surgeons,
Cristina : and we're over here being...
UNK: Suturing, code-running, lab-delivering penis minders.
Alex : I hate being an intern.
UNK: [Baby crying]
Derek : - Hi. - Hi.
Meredith : - Is he yours? - Yeah.
Meredith : - He's adorable. - Thanks.
UNK: Paeds Intern : Oh, please.
UNK: Paeds Intern : You are so out of line.
Father : She says the murmur might not be benign.
Meredith : I think we should do an echo to check.
UNK: Paeds Intern : This is your career.
Meredith : There really is no reason to get alarmed.
Resident : What's the problem?
Mother : If our baby is sick, we want him treated.
Bailey : - Now. - Who said your baby was sick?
UNK: Paeds Intern : The surgical intern, who has no business on our service.
UNK: Who authorized you?
Meredith : - I was just... - I did.
UNK: Can you excuse us for a second?
Meredith : Dr. Burke.
UNK: Are you messing with my intern, Dr. Kay?
UNK: No, sir. Give me the chart.
UNK: Paeds Intern : There's nothing wrong with him. I checked.
Burke : - Are you sure? - Yes.
UNK: You can guarantee he's fine? You're 100 percent sure?
Kerr : - How sure are you? - I don't know, 75 percent?
Burke : Not good enough. He's my patient now.
UNK: That OK with you, Dr. Kay?
Kerr : - Absolutely. - He can take our patient?
