Meredith : Oh, man. It's 911 for Katie Bryce.
UNK: I got to go.
George : Maybe I should have gone into geriatrics.
George : No one minds when you kill an old person.
Cristina : Surgery is hot. It's the Marines.
UNK: It's macho. It's hostile. It's hardcore.
Cristina : Geriatrics is for freaks who live with their mothers and never have sex.
George : I've got to get my own place.
UNK: [Chuckles]
UNK: Excuse me! Excuse me!
Katie : Took you long enough.
UNK: You're OK? The nurse paged me 911.
UNK: I had to go all Exorcist to get her to even pick up the phone.
UNK: [Panting] Wait. There's nothing wrong with you?
Katie : I'm bored.
Meredith : You little...
Meredith : - I'm not a cruise director. - You don't have to wig out.
UNK: The pageant's on cable,
Katie : but this crappy hospital doesn't get the channel.
Katie : If that cow Kylie Wood is gonna walk off with my crown, I have to see it.
Katie : Can you call someone?
UNK: OK. This is an actual hospital.
Meredith : There are sick people here.
Meredith : Go to sleep and stop wasting my time.
Katie : But I can't sleep. My head's all full.
UNK: That's called "thinking." Go with it.
UNK: [Woman on PA] Pain Management to 209. Pain Management to 209.
Nurse : What do you need?
UNK: [Sighs] Mr. Jones has junky veins, and he really needs antibiotics.
Izzie : I should start a central line.
Nurse : So start one.
Nurse : You don't know how.
Izzie : I've never done one.
Nurse : Well, you know what that means.
UNK: Can't we just page someone else?
Nurse : She's the on-call resident.
Meredith : OK.
UNK: OK, I'll just... I'll wake her.
Izzie : Dr. Bailey, I don't mean to bother you.
Bailey : - Then don't. - It's Mr. Jones.
Bailey : - Is he dying? - No.
Bailey : Then stop talking to me.
UNK: [Clears throat]
UNK: [Sighs] What is it?!
Bailey : Next time you wake me,
Bailey : he better be so close to dead there's a tag on his toe.
UNK: Here. Take these to the lab.
UNK: [Man] 4-B's got post-op pneumonia. Let's start antibiotics.
Nurse : Are you sure that's the right diagnosis?
Karev : Well, I don't know. I'm only an intern.
Karev : Why don't you go spend four years in med school
UNK: and then let me know if it's the right diagnosis?
Karev : She's short of breath. She's got fever.
Karev : She's post-op. Start the antibiotics.
Karev : God, I hate nurses.
Karev : I'm Alex. I'm with Jeremy. You're with the Nazi, right?
Meredith : She may not have pneumonia, you know.
Meredith : She could be splinting, or have a P.E.
Karev : Like I said, I hate nurses.
Meredith : What did you just say?
Meredith : Did you just call me a nurse?
Karev : Well, if the white cap fits.
UNK: [Pager beeping]
UNK: Damn it, Katie.
UNK: - Is she seeing anybody? - I don't know.
UNK: [Whistles] She's hot.
George : I'm friends with her.
UNK: I mean, kind of friends...
UNK: Not actually friends exactly,
UNK: but we're tight, and we hang out.
George : - Really, only just today... - Dude. Dude, stop talking.
