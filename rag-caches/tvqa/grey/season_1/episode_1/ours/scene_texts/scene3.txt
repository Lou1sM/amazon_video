Derek : Now it's Dr. Shepherd.
Meredith : We should pretend it never happened.
UNK: What never happened? You sleeping with me,
Derek : or you throwing me out this morning?
UNK: Both are memories I'd like to hold onto.
Meredith : No, there will be no memories.
Meredith : I'm not the girl in the bar anymore, and you're not the guy.
Meredith : This can't exist. You get that, right?
Derek : You took advantage of me, and you wanna forget.
UNK: I was drunk and good-Iooking. You took advantage.
UNK: OK, I was the one who was drunk, and you are not that good-Iooking.
Derek : Maybe not today.
UNK: Last night, I was good-Iooking. Had my red shirt on.
Derek : - You took advantage. - I did not take advantage.
Derek : Want to take advantage again? Friday night?
Meredith : No.
Meredith : You're an attending and I'm your intern.
Meredith : - Stop looking at me like that. - Like what?
Meredith : Like you've seen me naked.
Meredith : Dr. Shepherd, this is inappropriate.
Meredith : Has that ever occurred to you?
UNK: [Sighs]
George : Open, identify, ligate, remove, irrigate, close.
