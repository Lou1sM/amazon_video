Rachel : Everybody left?
UNK: All right. Well, just tell Emma that we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.
UNK: - RacheI! - Oh, God, sorry!
Ross : I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Rachel : - Emma's awake. - Yeah?
Rachel : I can't believe this.
Rachel : This is her first birthday, she's awake, we're not even there.
Rachel : Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Ross : Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know, try to turn it into something else.
UNK: Oh, don't even bother.
UNK: We've already ruined her first birthday.
Rachel : And do you know how important these early experiences are, Ross? Very!
Rachel : According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
UNK: Rach, she's not gonna remember this.
Rachel : I guess.
Rachel : Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know?
Rachel : Emma laughing...
Rachel : ...and everybody gathered around her cake, singing "Happy Birthday. "
UNK: And then we would all- Hey, get out of the road, you stupid student driver!
Rachel : They have to learn.
Monica : - Hey. - What?
UNK: This is not bad.
UNK: Oh, my God. Look, you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
Ross : Well, I just made these two things cheeks.
Ross : And then I split this to make ears.
UNK: Well, I am very impressed.
Ross : Some can sing, some can dance.
Ross : I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
UNK: Now, another way to organize your stuffed animals is by size.
Chandler : I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
