Chandler : What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
Joey : Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Phoebe : - No, it did not. - No.
UNK: Well, we'd better get going. It's late.
UNK: Jack can't drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
Jack : Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene.
Jack : The papers thought it was a hate crime.
Judy : - Anyway, it was lovely seeing you. - Okay.
Judy : - Bye. Bye, dear. - Nighty-night.
Joey : - Nighty-night. - Bye.
Phoebe : - How could you just let them leave? - Hey, hey, hey.
Joey : I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's a great man. He fought for our country.
Monica : No, he didn't. He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Joey : Well, that's it. He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
Chandler : You do know I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Joey : Oh, I forgot you used to live here.
Judy : - Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.
Monica : - Hey. - So how'd your audition go today?
Joey : - What audition? - The one I told you about last week.
Joey : What? You never said anything about an audition.
Estelle : Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition.
Estelle : I think you can still make it.
UNK: It's down at the Astor Theater, and you need to have a monologue prepared.
UNK: A monologue? I don't have a-
Rachel : I got it.
Joey : So I'm gonna take off.
Chandler : - What? - No, wait! You don't get to leave.
Phoebe : I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute.
UNK: And we paid for a room that we're supposed to be in right now!
UNK: Well, okay, now...
Phoebe : ...only one of us has to stay with Emma.
UNK: Okay, and as the person who realized that, I get to go.
Everybody : No, no, no. No. No.
Monica : Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Joey : Oh, I got it.
UNK: Okay, everyone pick a number from one to 10, all right?
Joey : Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
UNK: - Okay, 10. - Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.
Joey : Anyone else?
Phoebe : - No, let's just draw straws. - Okay.
Joey : Or we could flip a coin and multiply the answer-
UNK: - I'm begging you to stop. - Right.
UNK: Okay, how about this? We got wind-up toys for Emma.
UNK: We can make them race, and whoever comes in last stays.
Phoebe : Yeah, let's do that!
Chandler : That sounds more fun than the thing we were gonna do in Vermont!
UNK: - Okay, everybody, pick your toys! - Okay. I want the dolphin!
Chandler : - That's a bear! - I'm too excited!
Monica : Phoebe, you get the bear. Joey, you get the robot.
Joey : - Oh, yeah. - And Chandler and I get the dog.
Monica : And the race is going to go from here to here.
Monica : Now, the one who comes in last stays!
UNK: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys.
UNK: - Okay. On your mark, get set, go! - Go! Go!
Joey : Come on, robot!
