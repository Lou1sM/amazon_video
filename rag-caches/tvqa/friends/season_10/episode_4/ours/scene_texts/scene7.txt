UNK: Game?
UNK: Emma, do you even know it's your birthday today? You're 1.
UNK: One year old. That's little.
UNK: That's my girI.
Monica : That's how old you are.
Chandler : Did I teach her that? Did I just impart wisdom?
Monica : I want one.
Chandler : Me too.
UNK: There's no one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Monica : - And head to Canada. - I was kidding.
Monica : I wasn't. Let's get going.
UNK: - Hey, are Ross and RacheI back? - No, not yet.
Phoebe : - Oh, good, I didn't miss the party. - What about your massage client?
Phoebe : I just felt so bad missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know.
Phoebe : As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it'll be all right.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: If Ross and RacheI ask, I've been here the whole time. The whole time.
Joey : I've been here the whole time.
Ross : Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Rachel : I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks, you guys.
Chandler : Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see what Emma just did.
Chandler : - What? - Emma, how old are you?
Chandler : How old are you today?
Rachel : Emma, that's right. You're that many.
Ross : Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.
Ross : - This means- - No! No science camp!
UNK: Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Rachel : Oh, and, Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly.
UNK: Thanks.
Ross : Okay, here we go.
Ross : Emma's first birthday cake.
UNK: Go ahead, Emma, blow out the candle.
UNK: Come on, Emma. You can do it.
Ross : - What's wrong? Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, nothing.
Rachel : These are happy tears.
Rachel : This is just what I wanted.
Phoebe : Hey, you made it into a bunny.
Joey : What is wrong with me? It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
Ross : - Okay, you ready? - Yeah.
Ross : - And record. - Okay.
UNK: Big Brother audition. Take one.
UNK: I guess you could say I'm kind of a player.
UNK: Okay. Let's-
UNK: - Let's just try that again. - Okay.
Chandler : Hi, Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and-
UNK: Go! Go! Come on!
UNK: Go! Go! Come on!
Phoebe : Go! Go, Alan! Run, you hairy bastard!
