Monica : - Hey, guys. - Hey.
Chandler : Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Monica : That place in Vermont? You can take a hint.
Rachel : You can't go away this weekend. It's Emma's birthday.
Rachel : We're having a party.
UNK: Can't you have the party when we get back?
UNK: No. It won't be her reaI birthday.
UNK: Gee, if only she were 1 and had no idea what the hell a birthday was.
UNK: Come on, you guys, this is really important to us.
Monica : Sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away...
Monica : - ... you know, to reconnect, emotionally. - There's this thing I really want us to do.
Chandler : I read about it in Maxim.
Rachel : Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Ross : Yeah, we want everyone to be there.
Ross : As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Rachel : And, I mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deaI.
Rachel : How can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle?
UNK: I promise I won't do any magic.
Monica : All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler : Fine. But if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party-
Monica : Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that.
