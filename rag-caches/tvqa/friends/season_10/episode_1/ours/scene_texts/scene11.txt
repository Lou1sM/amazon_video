Chandler : - What are you singing? - It's "Bolero" from 1 0.
UNK: It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from Apocalypse Now.
UNK: Here's the thing. The cornrows were a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.
UNK: Now that we're home, you don't have that problem. If you think about it...
UNK: I hate them.
Monica : - What? You said you liked them. - Did I? Let's refresh.
Chandler : I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
UNK: Well, fine. So you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Chandler : Again, let's journey back.
UNK: As I recall, Rachel said she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.
UNK: And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize there was anything different.
Monica : You know what? I don't care. I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.
Monica : You're just jealous because your hair can't do this.
UNK: - Get yourself in the tooth? - And the eye.
Ross : Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma. Oh, my God, I missed you.
UNK: Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.
UNK: Did you have a good time with Grandma Greene? Huh?
Ross : Did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again to use as a rattle?
Rachel : That was one time, Ross, and they were only, like, five milligrams.
Ross : Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for you, okay? I want you to wait right here.
UNK: Oome here, sweetie.
Rachel : Ross, actually, there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Ross : Okay, shoot.
UNK: - Okay. All right, here's the deal. - Oh, no!
UNK: Joey's Voice, But She Sees Ross : - What is it? - Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Rachel : - Look, Ross, this really isn't easy. - Oh, it's all over everything!
UNK: Why? Why me?
UNK: Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?
UNK: I guess things were just going too well for me.
Ross : I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?
UNK: - Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and... - Oh, not another one!
UNK: Oh, my God... Oh, and this is moisturizer! It's even harder to clean!
Ross : Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
UNK: - Wow. Clearly this is not a good time. - You think?
Phoebe : Okay. Bye.
UNK: All right, so Mike's on his way over.
UNK: You thought you were meeting here, he thought at the restaurant, so...
UNK: It doesn't matter who's right or wrong. The point is, I'm gonna take off.
