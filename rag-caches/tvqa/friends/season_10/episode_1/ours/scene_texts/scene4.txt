Monica : Other wall, people! Other wall!
UNK: - Rach, you there? - Oh, my God, that's Ross!
Joey : - What are we gonna do? - Okay, just be calm.
UNK: For all he knows, we're just hanging out.
UNK: All right? So just be nonchalant.
Rachel : - That's not nonchalant! - No idea what it means.
Rachel : Okay, just hide.
Joey : - Rach? - Ooming! Try under the bed.
Rachel : There's no room under the bed...
Charlie : - Is everything okay? - Yeah.
UNK: - Hey. Do you know where Joey is? - Hi.
Rachel : I really don't.
Ross : - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah. Sure.
Joey : I don't believe this. Have you guys been...?
UNK: This is the listening side of the wall.
Ross : Then she told me that she and Joey had broken up...
UNK: ...and part of the reason was she had feelings for me.
Rachel : Right. Yeah.
UNK: You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Rachel : Oh, I know, I know. That's been really hard for you.
UNK: Anyway, one thing led to another, and...
UNK: ...before you know it, we were kissing.
Ross : How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?
UNK: That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
UNK: I gotta find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Rachel : You would think.
UNK: Joey?
Joey : - Is he gone? - How are you doing this?
UNK: What? Hey!
Rachel : What are you...? What is this? Have you been listening this entire time?
UNK: Yeah!
Phoebe : Now, what is this?
Rachel : What is this? Well, let's see. We kissed for 1 0 minutes...
Rachel : ...and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.
UNK: No, no. Have you thought about how complicated this could get?
Phoebe : - What about Ross? - Well, he's with Charlie now.
Monica : Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her.
Monica : And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
UNK: You're a pain in my ass, Geller.
UNK: Look, we appreciate all the advice...
Rachel : ...but this is between Joey and me. We can handle it.
UNK: We'll go. Will you do one thing for us, the people that care about you?
Monica : - Sure. - Enunciate.
Rachel : Get out!
Rachel : Are they right?
Joey : Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should...
UNK: ...hold off until we talk to Ross.
Rachel : Yeah. Yeah. We can wait. We don't have to do anything tonight.
