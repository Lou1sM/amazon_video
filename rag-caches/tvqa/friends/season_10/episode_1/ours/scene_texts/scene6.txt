UNK: Wow, it's kind of weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
UNK: Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Joey : Does someone mind switching and sitting with Charlie?
UNK: Oh, I mean, l... Dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Joey : - I understand. - No, I'll do it.
UNK: Wish I could switch. I really don't want to sit with Allen Iverson over there.
UNK: [scene : - Hey. - Hey.
Phoebe : Once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seat belt sign...
Phoebe : ...you feel free to roam about my cabin.
UNK: And you should be careful when checking your overhead bins.
UNK: - Because items may shift during... - Oh, you're not good at this.
UNK: - Do you have to go home tonight? - No, I think I could come over.
Phoebe : It's Saturday, right?
UNK: What?
Mike : - I can't do anything tonight. - Why not?
Mike : I have a date.
Phoebe : - You have a date? With who? - Oh, it's my girlfriend.
UNK: - You have a girlfriend? - Yeah.
Mike : Well, when you and I broke up, I started seeing someone.
UNK: - Well, for how long? - Three months.
Mike : Three months?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: This is none of my business, but how long are you gonna keep seeing her?
Mike : I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
Phoebe : Oh, okay, good. You do that.
UNK: When you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Mike : Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.
UNK: - Pull out the packing material... - We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.
UNK: It's our last glimpse of Barbados.
UNK: And my last glimpse of anything.
UNK: All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time.
UNK: He's in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty-free."
Charlie : Okay. Good luck.
UNK: You know, if he's not okay with this then nothing more can happen between us.
Rachel : I know.
UNK: Well, if that's the case, I just want you to know...
UNK: ...that I think I could have fallen for you really, really hard.
UNK: On the other hand, if he is okay with us...
UNK: ...then, you know, it's cas, whatever.
Rachel : Ross is coming over. I think now would be a good time to talk to him.
Joey : I guess so. I'm just... I'm really nervous.
Rachel : Well, keep in mind that by the time you're done...
Rachel : ...they'll probably be serving dinner.
Rachel : Still nervous?
Joey : I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Ross : - Hey, Rach? - Yeah?
Ross : - Do you mind if I sit here for a sec? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Charlie : Good luck.
UNK: [scene : - Hey. - Hey.
Phoebe : So I...
UNK: I kind of need to talk to you about Charlie.
Monica : - Yeah? - Last night, after you guys broke up...
UNK: So sorry to hear about that, by the way.
Ross : Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...
UNK: Well...
Joey : You kissed.
UNK: Wh... What?
Ross : What? What would give you that idea?
Joey : - I saw you. - Yeah, we kissed.
Ross : But nothing else. Nothing else happened, okay?
Joey : - Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay. - What?
UNK: It's okay. You know, look...
UNK: ...I totally understand, all right? You guys...
Joey : ...make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know? And...
Joey : - I want you to be happy. - Are you serious?
UNK: Yeah.
Joey : - Now I have something... - I am speechless.
Ross : I mean, the fact that you would put my happiness first like that, I mean...
Ross : You're an incredible friend, do you know that?
UNK: - Well, look, before you go... - No, I mean it.
UNK: I mean, you're so loyal, man. And selfless and generous.
Joey : I am those things, yeah.
UNK: I've known Chandler longer, so I think of him as my best friend. But now...
UNK: ...I may have to rethink some stuff.
UNK: Dude!
Ross : Hey, if there is ever anything I can do for you...
Joey : I can't think of anything.
Ross : - Thanks. - Yeah.
Rachel : - So hi. - Hi.
UNK: - So you talked to Joey? - Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Rachel : - Oh, that's great. - Yeah.
Rachel : - So everything's okay? - Oh, no, it's great.
UNK: - It's great. He's an amazing guy. - Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.
Ross : Well, I'm so excited about this.
