Phoebe : And then we're gonna grab some food. So if you want...
Ross : - Finally. - Is that Ross?
Monica : Yeah. You can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Phoebe : - Sounds like he's with someone. - He could be alone.
UNK: This morning I heard him do pushups and then talk to his triceps.
Monica : Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.
UNK: Yeah, I hear someone else in there with him.
Charlie : - Dr. Geller! - God, you're amazing.
Ross : I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Monica : - Oh, my God, that's Charlie! - She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Phoebe : Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!
Monica : - I'm not sure about this. - Yeah, you're right.
Phoebe : This is none of our business.
UNK: I'm not sure it's the best way to hear everything. Get me a glass!
UNK: No, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
Rachel : I love Barbados.
Joey : I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Rachel : I know. I'm her.
Phoebe : Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!
Monica : - What? - Get over here!
UNK: Oh, my God! I love how thin these walls are!
Monica : Thank you.
UNK: Hey, before, you said that nothing could happen between us. What changed?
Joey : Well, I only said that because of Ross.
UNK: - And then I saw him kissing Charlie. - What?
Rachel : Ross and Charlie?
UNK: Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh?
UNK: - Eh, who am I to talk? - Yeah.
Monica : I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Chandler : How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?
UNK: - No one is manning that wall! - I'm on it!
Chandler : - Anything? - I think I hear curtains closing.
Phoebe : We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Monica : Bedsprings! Unmistakable!
UNK: - You realize that's your brother. - Not until you said it. Somebody switch!
UNK: Wow! Wait a minute.
UNK: Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.
UNK: Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones leaving with the person we came with!
Chandler : That's not true. I came with Monica, I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Monica : Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.
UNK: - Tomorrow I'm going to the salon. - Okay, Buckwheat.
Phoebe : You gotta hear this, it's great! It's like free porn.
