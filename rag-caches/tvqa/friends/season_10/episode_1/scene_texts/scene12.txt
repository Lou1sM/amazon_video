UNK: Wait. I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on. I mean...
Precious : ...are you guys getting back together or something?
Rachel : All right.
UNK: Susie... Oan I call you Susie?
Precious : My name is Precious.
Phoebe : I can't say that.
UNK: Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.
Phoebe : Mike and I are back together. And unfortunately...
Phoebe : ...that effectively ends your relationship with him.
UNK: He's very sorry about that, and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors.
Precious : I just can't believe this. Why?
Phoebe : - Well, I don't... - Why would he do this?
UNK: - What's wrong with me? - There's nothing wrong with you.
Precious : What the hell am I supposed to do now?
Phoebe : Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!
UNK: Have some pride, for the love of God!
Phoebe : Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
Precious : I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
