UNK: He didn't know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me.
Precious : He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever!
Phoebe : Look, Precious...
Phoebe : Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman...
Phoebe : ...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.
Phoebe : He proposed to me while he was still seeing you.
UNK: He was gonna break up with you on your birthday?
UNK: I don't like to kiss and tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
UNK: Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him.
Precious : I deserve to be treated with respect.
Precious : Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!
Phoebe : You're welcome.
Chandler : Honey? You've been in there for a long time. Is everything okay?
Monica : Not really.
Monica : I have a problem.
Chandler : Really? What happened?
Monica : Well, I was dancing around and singing "No Woman, No Cry"...
Monica : ...and I got stuck.
Chandler : - You can't move at all? - Oh, I can move.
Chandler : If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the cornrows?
Joey : I guess so.
UNK: - Some of these look a little frayed. - Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
UNK: [scene : - Hey. - Hi.
UNK: - So? Did you tell Ross? - Well, I tried...
Rachel : ...but then he had a shampoo-related emergency.
Rachel : - So I guess now it's your turn again. - No, no, no, no.
UNK: I think it's better if you tell him. You know, it's easier for a woman.
UNK: That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go :
UNK: "I didn't mean it.
UNK: I'm so sorry."
UNK: Yeah, because that's what we do.
UNK: All right, all right, okay. How about this? How about this? Tomorrow...
Joey : Tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Rachel : Okay, that sounds fair.
UNK: - That just means, once again, we can't... - I know.
Joey : That's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves. We're not animals.
Rachel : - No! Of course, we can wait. - Yeah.
UNK: All right, so I guess that means good night then.
UNK: Yep. Good night.
Rachel : Good night.
Rachel : Good night.
Rachel : - Seriously, good night. - Stop saying good night.
UNK: I'm so sorry.
Monica : Look what I found in the drawer.
Monica : And you said I'd never wear this.
UNK: Now that I untangled you, how about you do a little something for me?
UNK: - Sure. What did you have in mind? - I think you know.
UNK: - Really? I don't... I don't really feel like it. - This is what I want to do.
UNK: Okay.
Monica : I just don't get why you like it so much.
UNK: She's an FBI agent posing as a beauty contestant!
