Phoebe : - Hi, Mike's place. - Hey, it's Mike.
Phoebe : - That was fast. - Oh, no, she's not here yet.
UNK: You know, I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone.
Phoebe : You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike, strap on a pair.
UNK: Why don't you tell her that we got back together. Women appreciate honesty.
Phoebe : We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while, just FYI.
Mike : One more thing. There might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
UNK: Her name's Precious?
UNK: Is she a pure breed, or did you pick her up at the pound?
UNK: - I just want to give you a heads up. - Okay. And if she gets upset...
UNK: ...just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snap.
UNK: What do you know, another hot blonde.
Precious : Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?
Phoebe : - I'm Phoebe. - Phoebe?
Precious : Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe? The love of his life? That Phoebe?
Monica : Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these!
Chandler : - You go back to work tomorrow night? - Yeah.
