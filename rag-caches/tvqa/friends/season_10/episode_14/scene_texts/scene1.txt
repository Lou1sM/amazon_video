Joey : I am not gonna help you do that!
Rachel : Oh, my God.
Rachel : Hi. I'm here to see Mr. Campbell, with Gucci.
UNK: The reservation's probably under Gucci.
UNK: It's spelled like "gucky," which can be confusing.
UNK: Maitre D' : Mr. Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Rachel : Oh, my God. That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
UNK: Maitre D' : I'm sorry, that's always Mr. Campbell's table.
Rachel : But my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
UNK: I know. With "gucky."
UNK: [scene : - Rachel? - I'm on a date.
UNK: Mr Zellner : That's great.
Rachel : Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom. Career.
Rachel : You gotta get out there.
UNK: Well, you've got a good energy.
UNK: [scene : - Rachel? - Yes, hi.
UNK: Mr Campbell : - James Campbell. - Hi.
Rachel : - Excuse us. - Please.
Rachel : He's cute.
UNK: Thank you, JewHunks. com, huh?
UNK: So...
Rachel : Whatever happened to just singing for no reason?
UNK: Mr Campbell : Maybe people found it weird.
UNK: So...
UNK: Mr Campbell : - Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren? - What?
Chandler : - I don't. - You don't?
UNK: No, I love... I love it there.
UNK: Mr Campbell : Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
UNK: What?
UNK: Mr Campbell : That's Hugo Boss?
UNK: I believe what she's trying to tell you is that I'm her boss.
UNK: Mr. Boss...
UNK: ...it is a pleasure to meet you.
Phoebe : This place is so depressing. If I had to work here, I'd kill myself.
Phoebe : But you obviously haven't.
Clerk : - How can I help you? - I need to change my name, please.
Phoebe : See, I need to change it because I'm hiding from the law.
Phoebe : You're fun.
Clerk : - You need to fill out this form. - Okay. Well, just so I know...
Phoebe : I don't know how it works. My name is Buffay...
Phoebe : ...and my husband's name is Hannigan.
Phoebe : So is it supposed to be "Buffay-Hannigan" or "Hannigan-Buffay"?
Clerk : - It can be anything you want. - Well, not anything.
Clerk : Yeah. Anything.
Phoebe : Oh, this could take a while.
Clerk : - Get out of my line. - Okay.
UNK: [scene : - Hey. - Hey, Pheebs.
Phoebe : Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Monica : - Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan. - Wrong again.
Phoebe : Apparently, you can change it to anything.
UNK: So I thought, "All right, here's an opportunity to be creative."
Phoebe : So meet Princess Consuela Bananahammock.
Chandler : That's what we were gonna name the baby.
