Joey : Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
UNK: Maybe it's because you hung your head out the window like a dog...
Monica : ...the whole ride here.
UNK: Maybe.
Joey : So this is the living room, huh? It's pretty dark.
Joey : - No, it's not. - Are you kidding?
Joey : I think I just saw a bat in the corner.
Chandler : When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
UNK: Maybe.
UNK: Look, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know?
Joey : Or any other house for that matter.
Monica : Oh, Joey.
Monica : We know you're having a hard time with this, but we...
Monica : - We love it here. - Fine! If you love this house so much...
UNK: ...you should live here. Okay? I hope you get used to that weird humming sound.
Monica : - Joey, we know that's you. - No...
Joey : ...it's not.
