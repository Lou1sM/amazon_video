Joey : My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
Girl : I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Mackenzie : I hate my parents.
Joey : I hate my friends.
Joey : Look, there's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Mackenzie : Like what?
Joey : Okay, you come with me and you tell them that the house is haunted.
UNK: What are you, 8?
Joey : - Okay. Let's hear your great idea. - I don't have any great ideas.
UNK: I am 8.
Joey : There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know...
UNK: ...if Monica and Chandler move here, and Phoebe's married to Mike...
Joey : ...that just leaves me and Ross and Rach. You know what I mean?
Mackenzie : I really don't.
Joey : What am I gonna do? I feel like I'm losing my friends.
UNK: - My parents say I'll make new friends. - Yeah, sure, easy for you.
Joey : You're young. Me? I'm set in my ways.
Mackenzie : This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners.
Mackenzie : Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
Joey : Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.
Mackenzie : Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Joey : Yeah. Maybe.
UNK: Then you've gotta let them go.
UNK: Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're...
Joey : You're probably right.
UNK: How'd you get to be so smart?
Mackenzie : I read a lot.
Joey : Just when I thought we could be friends.
