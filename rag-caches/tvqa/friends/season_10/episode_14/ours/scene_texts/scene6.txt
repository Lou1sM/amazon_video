UNK: Oh, hey, Rach. I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Rachel : Oh, thank you...
Man : You still don't know my name, do you?
Rachel : Well, now I don't have to.
Rachel : Ross, what is taking you so long?
Ross : I'm sorry. It's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway.
UNK: Rachel?
Rachel : Mark? Oh, my God.
UNK: - How have you been? - Fantastic. You remember Ross.
Mark : Sure. Sure.
Mark : What's with the chair?
Ross : You know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
UNK: Clever.
Mark : So how are you?
Rachel : You're not catching me on my best day.
Mark : Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't say "big promotion."
Rachel : No, but it's good. You know, I'm gonna take some time off...
UNK: ...and do charity work. - Are you sure?
Mark : We may have something at Louis Vuitton.
UNK: Screw charity work. What do you got?
UNK: Why don't we have dinner and talk?
UNK: - Great. I'll call you. - Okay.
UNK: - Nice to see you again. - Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.
Rachel : Oh, my God.
Ross : See? I told you something good would come along.
Ross : And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Rachel : Ross, that's Mark.
Rachel : From Bloomingdale's? You were insanely jealous of him.
Ross : - That is Mark? - Yes.
Ross : I hate that guy.
Ross : No, no, no. You cannot go to dinner with him.
Rachel : - What? You don't want me to get a job? - Yeah, I'm sure he'll give you a job.
UNK: Maybe make you his "sex-cretary."
Ross : I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
UNK: You know what...? Okay, let's talk about it later. There comes security.
Monica : Oh, I love this street.
UNK: The trees and the big front yards and the actual picket fences.
Chandler : Man, those two dogs are going at it.
UNK: - Hey. Where you been? - Oh, just, you know, looking around.
Joey : But you know what?
Joey : This house is great.
Chandler : Really? What changed your mind?
Joey : The little girl who lives here made me feel better about the whole thing.
Chandler : Joey? There was a little girl who lived here, but she died, like, 30 years ago.
UNK: What?
Chandler : I'm just messing with you.
Joey : That's not funny. You know I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.
Monica : Now that you're okay with the house, do you want to go see your room?
UNK: What?
Joey : I get my own room?
Chandler : You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room, do you?
Rachel : Oh, my God.
Joey : Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Chandler : - No. - Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
UNK: After you, Ms. Bananahammock.
UNK: Thank you, Mr. Bag.
Phoebe : - Oh, hi, Rita. - How are you?
UNK: Good. Oh, Rita's a massage client.
