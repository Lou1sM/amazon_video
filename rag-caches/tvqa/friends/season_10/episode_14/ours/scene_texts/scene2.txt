UNK: - Hey, how did the interview go? - Not good.
Chandler : I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Rachel : Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Chandler : That is a bad interview.
Phoebe : What are you talking about? How did this happen?
Rachel : My boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview...
Rachel : ...and he heard everything.
UNK: Later, he calls me into his office and tells me he'll have to let me go...
Rachel : ...because I'm not a team player.
Rachel : And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."
UNK: And then I had to sit there for 45 minutes...
Rachel : ...while he proved that that, in fact, was true.
Monica : Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: What...? What's this?
UNK: Why, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?

UNK: This is a big night for him. I don't wanna spoil it.
Mark : - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'll be fine.
UNK: Okay. Everybody take one, okay?
Chandler : Israeli champagne.
Chandler : And it's vanilla.
Ross : I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.
Ross : Hey, Rach, so how did your thing go?
UNK: Good. But I won't hear about that for a couple days.
Ross : Oh, you know what, you're gonna get it. I can feel it.
Phoebe : Can you?
UNK: All right, everybody, here's to Ross.
Ross : And to years of hard work finally paying off.

Ross : I have job security for life.
UNK: You know? I mean, I never have to worry.
Ross : Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Rachel : No, it's not that. I got fired today.
Rachel : And I didn't get the other job.
Ross : Rach, I'm so sorry.
Ross : - Great, I feel like an idiot. - No, it's okay. You didn't know.
