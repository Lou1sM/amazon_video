UNK: Phoebe-estelle : What are you saying?
UNK: I'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, Estelle?
UNK: You're fired. Goodbye.
Phoebe : Man, tough week for Estelle.
Ross : - Hi. - Hi.
UNK: Emma left her stuffed T. rex at my house.
UNK: - You know she can't sleep without it. - Well, she's asleep now.
Rachel : - Stop forcing that thing on her. - Okay.
UNK: You're not gonna believe what happened to me today!
Rachel : Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!
Ross : - No! - I mean, it was the weirdest thing.
UNK: They fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.
UNK: I mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!
UNK: - So you're not going to Paris? - No, I'm still going!
UNK: What?
UNK: Well, when the Louis Vuitton people found out...
Rachel : ...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, they offered me more money!
UNK: Ross, isn't that great?
