Chandler : I want you.
Chandler : I need you.
Janice : Chandler, what are you talking about?
Chandler : Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.
Chandler : Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
Janice : I don't know what to say.
Janice : I mean, you know, obviously we have this heat between us.
UNK: Obviously.
Janice : But I love my husband.
Janice : And I know you love your wife.
Janice : I don't think we should get this house now.
UNK: Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream and take it away.
Janice : Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
Chandler : I understand.
UNK: Although...
Janice : Maybe just one last moment of weakness.
Janice : Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
Chandler : They're never coming down now!
Ross : - Hi. - Hi!
Rachel : You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
UNK: What?
Rachel : Ralph Lauren called, again, and they offered me more money.
Ross : - They did? - Yes! It was the weirdest thing.
UNK: Zelner called me and said, "We will do anything we can to get you back."
UNK: And that I should thank some "Ron."
Rachel : I don't even know what department that guy's in!
Ross : - So, what are you gonna do? - Well, I took it!
Ross : That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Ross : - You're excited, right? - You know... Look, the money's great.
Rachel : - It's certainly the easier choice. - Right.
UNK: But, you know, I mean, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure.
Rachel : Was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?
Rachel : Oh, absolutely.
Rachel : Yeah, but you know, this is...
Rachel : It's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much...
UNK: ...gotten everything out of it that I possibly can.
Ross : I had no idea...
Ross : I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.
Ross : I mean, you said you were scared.
UNK: I mean, it was "good" scared, though, you know?
UNK: I mean, like "when I moved to New York" scared.
UNK: Or "when I found out I was gonna have Emma" scared.
Rachel : But this is fine. This is gonna be good.
Ross : You should go.
UNK: What?
Ross : It's what you want. You should go.
Rachel : You really think so?
Ross : I really do.
Rachel : But I already told Zelner that I would come back.
Ross : I'm sure he'll understand.
Rachel : All right. All right! I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna go to Paris!
Ross : - Yeah. - Yeah.
Rachel : I'm going to Paris!
Rachel : - Thank you, Ross. - Yeah, yeah.
Rachel : Oh, I'm so happy.
Ross : Then I'm happy too.
Joey : Thank you all for coming.
UNK: We're here today to pay our respects to a wonderful agent...
Joey : ...and a beautiful woman.
UNK: Inside.
Joey : As Estelle's only two clients, we would like to say a few words.
Joey : Dude, where's my speech?
Joey : That is entertaining. Al Zebooker, everybody!
