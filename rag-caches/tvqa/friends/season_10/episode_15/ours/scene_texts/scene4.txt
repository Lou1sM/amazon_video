UNK: Hi. We're buying the house next door. Could we just take a look around?
UNK: Sure, I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
UNK: I feel like we're cheating on our house.
UNK: If we cheat, shouldn't it be with a hot, younger house...
Chandler : ...that does stuff that our house won't do?
Monica : Ours is so much better!
Monica : This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave.
Monica : What a hole!
Lady : - So, what do you think? - Love it!
UNK: We already have one offer. I think the lady upstairs will make another one.
Monica : They could be our neighbors. What are they like?
UNK: The woman upstairs is nice. She and her husband have two kids.
UNK: - He's on Wall Street, and she's a... - Oh... my... God!
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Hey, Joey, you wanna come with me to...?
UNK: Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.
UNK: This has gotta be killing her.
UNK: No, that wouldn't kill her.
UNK: A coronary embolism might.
UNK: I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard. I was her only client.
Joey : Except for this guy who eats paper.
UNK: And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.
UNK: Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for 1 0 years.
UNK: - I'm gonna call her and hire her again. - No, no, no! Don't call her.
Phoebe : - You wait for her to call you. - Why?
Phoebe : Because patience is the road to understanding.
UNK: Which is the key to a happy heart.
Joey : You blow me away.
Phoebe : All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
Joey : - I promise. - Okay.
Joey : And that means never having to give a reason.
Janice : What a small world!
Realtor : You two know each other?
Janice : We go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him...
Janice : ...Chandler used to be my little love muffin.
UNK: Don't judge me.
UNK: Why not? I do.
Janice : So are you guys thinking of getting this house too?
Janice : Are we gonna have a bidding war? I better warn you, I'm a toughie.
UNK: Don't... Don't... Don't...
UNK: Don't do that.
Monica : No, actually, we are buying the house next door.
UNK: Why?
Monica : I don't know why.
Janice : Oh, that decides it, then! I was on the fence.
Janice : But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?
Janice : Now we have to get it!
UNK: Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.
