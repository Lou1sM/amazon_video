Phoebe : Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.
UNK: Anyway...
Phoebe : - Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? - Yeah.
Phoebe : - She died. - You're kidding!
Monica : - That's terrible. - Yeah, last Saturday.
Phoebe : Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic!
Phoebe : - Wait a minute, I read the wrong one. - Oh, yeah?
Phoebe : - Yeah, she was just an agent. - Joey's gonna be so upset.
UNK: I know. He always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Phoebe : We cannot tell Joey about this.
Phoebe : He's already flipping out about everything changing.
Phoebe : This'll push him over the edge.
Monica : - You don't think we should tell him? - Not for a while.
Phoebe : Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
UNK: What if he reads the paper?
Chandler : Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
