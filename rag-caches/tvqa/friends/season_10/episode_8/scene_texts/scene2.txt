Ross : - What a game. - I know. Yeah.
UNK: - I can't believe Chandler's missing this. - I'm sorry he's not here.
UNK: But I gotta say, I am really enjoying nacho chair.
Ross : Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Chandler : - Yeah! - These seats are great.
Ross : I know, I know. When I was here for "Holidays on Ice"...
Ross : ...I was sitting so far away, Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.
UNK: Dude, I'm sure she knows you heart her.
UNK: I hope so.
Joey : We'd better get going. If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.

UNK: Let's just stay for one more goaI.
Joey : - I don't know. - One more fight.
Monica : - Okay. - Okay.
