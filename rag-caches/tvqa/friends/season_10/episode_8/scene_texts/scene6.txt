Joey : It isn't working.
Monica : - We're gonna have to unscrew the chain. - Hurry, I can't feeI my ears.
UNK: Can you ever feeI your ears?
UNK: Interesting.
Monica : - Chandler, where are your tools? - Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.
Chandler : I don't have tools.
UNK: - Well, I do, but RacheI borrowed them. - I lent them to Ross.
Ross : - I gave them to Joey. - I left them at the park.
Ross : I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
UNK: I stuffed Brussels sprouts down his pants.
UNK: Nice.
Monica : Okay, I have to get that.
Monica : Now, when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone.
Monica : Thanksgiving is over. The vein has spoken.
Joey : - It's really starting to hurt. - Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...
UNK: ...and you guys push. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay?
Chandler : Okay, so push.
UNK: Just a sec. We're kind of in the middle of something here.
UNK: Hey, stop putting things down my pants.
Chandler : - Come on, guys, push! - Yeah, come on, push!
UNK: Joey And Chandler : Push! Push!
Chandler : - My cranberries! - Man, I got food all over me.
Chandler : I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you.

Monica : I don't care.
Chandler : What's going on?
Monica : That was the adoption agency.

Monica : This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Rachel : To Monica and Chandler and that knocked-up girI in Ohio.
Ross : I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Phoebe : I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Monica : I can't believe they called. I mean, we're actually getting a baby.
UNK: I know how you feeI.
Phoebe : - Really? - Sure.
Joey : I went through the exact same thing with Alicia May Emory.
UNK: The waiting, the wondering.
