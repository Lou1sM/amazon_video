Monica : I don't get older, I just get better.
Chandler : You know what just occurred to me?
Chandler : This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us.
Chandler : I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.
Monica : - You don't know that. - Somebody's gonna pick us.
Monica : But we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency.
UNK: I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.
Chandler : Next year, it's gonna be you, me and little Hemingway Bing.
UNK: - What? He's my favorite author. - Name one of his books.
Chandler : The Firm?
UNK: Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's in the oven. The stuffing is ready.
UNK: You know, you always cook this meaI all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Monica : Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.
Monica : But you don't have to do everything Dr. PhiI tells you to do.
Chandler : I'm serious, let me do something. Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.
UNK: Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.
UNK: It's easy to make, and no one really cares about it.
Chandler : Tell me more.
Monica : I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these.
Monica : Not with soap!
Chandler : You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes.
UNK: - Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has. - Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
Ross : Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Rachel : - Oh, my God. - Yeah, they're great seats too.
Ross : - Guess where they are. - Center ice.
Ross : Did I do something to you?
UNK: - The game's at 1. - So?
UNK: - Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back. - So we'll leave before it's over.
Chandler : But it could take us a long time to get back home.
UNK: Plus, Joey could get lost and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Joey : Dude, two times that happened!
UNK: Look, Monica's been working hard all day.
UNK: She didn't want to host in the first place. We shouldn't go.
Ross : He's right, man.
UNK: - Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4. - Okay.
Chandler : And get ready to taste my very speciaI cranberries.
UNK: Or should I say "Chan-berries"?
Joey : That's some gentle comedy, dude.
UNK: - We're still going to the game, right? - Yeah.
UNK: This is contestant number 16, Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.
Monica : - Hey. - Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.
UNK: This place is freaking me out.
Rachel : I've been watching this guy over there. I don't think he came with a kid.
UNK: But we can't leave now.
Phoebe : There was this one baby, Haley, who was favored to win...
Phoebe : ...she got croup, so she had to stay home.
Phoebe : This competition just blew wide-open, folks.
UNK: Phoebe, it's just too weird.
UNK: I just saw a 1-year-old with pantyhose on.
UNK: Oh, I know. We should've been more prepared.
Phoebe : It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our reaI competition now is Cameron.
Phoebe : My God, they just took her sweater off.
Phoebe : Look at those arms. Hello, Michelin Man.
Rachel : Phoebe, come on. You know what, it's already 3 : 00.
Rachel : They haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.
Phoebe : But Emma's got what it takes. She could go all the way!
Rachel : - Phoebe, you have to calm down. - Okay.
UNK: RacheI, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now.
UNK: I overheard a judge say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma.
Phoebe : - Really? - Yeah.
UNK: - You heard him say that? - Yeah.
UNK: All right. Okay. All right, let's give these babies something to cry about.
UNK: Good. Let's get down to business. Emma needs some makeup.
UNK: What?
UNK: She's gonna look washed-out next to the others.
UNK: No, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.
Phoebe : - Why not? - Because I already did.
