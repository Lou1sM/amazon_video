Phoebe : ...just to tell it.
Phoebe : There's something going on with them.
Phoebe : Look! He's getting into the car with her.
Rachel : That doesn't mean anything.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.
UNK: Okay, duck down.
Chandler : - Hello? - Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.
Phoebe : I know that Monica is working today...
UNK: ...so I was wondering if you wanted to come to the movies with me and RacheI.
UNK: Oh, I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck here at the office all day.
Phoebe : Well, it's a shame that you'll miss the movie...
UNK: ...because we were gonna see, you know, either Liar Liar...
UNK: ...or Betrayal or An Affair to Remember.
Chandler : Those are all really old.
UNK: Okay, then maybe it'll be-
Rachel : Dude, Where's My Car?
Phoebe : - What? - They're in a car.
UNK: Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye.
UNK: Jeez!
UNK: Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
UNK: Yeah, okay. Let me just grab my night-vision goggles and my stun gun.
Phoebe : I got them.
UNK: [scene : - Hey. - Hey. Hi, sweetie.
Monica : Hey, you smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Chandler : - I was in the car with Nancy. - Nancy doesn't smoke.
UNK: Well, at least the perfume's not mine. Be thankfuI for that.
UNK: So... What did you think of the house?
UNK: It's everything we've been looking for.
UNK: Isn't it? And what about the amazing wanes coating...
Monica : ...the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
UNK: And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!
Chandler : What were the things you said?
UNK: - Don't you love the huge yard? - The fireplace in the bedroom.
UNK: And Nancy said it's really underpriced...
Monica : ...because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Chandler : This is bringing out a lovely color in you.
Monica : So do you think we should get it?
UNK: I don't know. What do you think?
Monica : - I think we should. - I do too.
UNK: This is huge. How bad do you wanna smoke right now?
UNK: I don't know what you mean, giant, talking cigarette.
UNK: Phoebe called as I was getting into Nancy's car.
Chandler : If she asks you, I was at work all day.
UNK: Got you. When do we tell them?
UNK: We don't. Not untiI it's 100 percent. Why upset everybody over nothing?
Monica : Okay. Right.
Monica : - Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard. - I know. Good luck with it.
UNK: I just can't see Chandler cheating.
UNK: I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester.
UNK: They went in for 45 minutes, and then they came out looking pretty happy.
UNK: Chandler?
Rachel : Forty-five minutes?
UNK: Well, something's not right.
UNK: So you went all the way to Westchester, waited 45 minutes...
UNK: - ... and came back in a cab? - Yeah.
UNK: If each of you guys would like to pitch in 100 bucks, that would be great.
UNK: I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.
Ross : I know, and with the baby coming?
Phoebe : - So should we tell her? - I don't know.
Ross : If one of us saw Mike with another woman, would you want us to tell you?
UNK: Why? Who'd you see him with?
UNK: - No one. I'm just saying if we did- - Tell me what you know!
UNK: No one! Nothing! Mike's a great guy! It was hypotheticaI!
UNK: All right. He is a good guy.
UNK: You're right. He wouldn't cheat.
UNK: If I did see him with someone, there's no way I-
Phoebe : Who did you see him with?
