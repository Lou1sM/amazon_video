Joey : Okay, Ross.
UNK: I realize that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but...
Joey : - Let me explain, okay? - We weren't doing anything!
Joey : Rach, he just saw us.
Joey : But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
UNK: - That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados. - Dude, chill!
UNK: Joey to Rachel : Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...
UNK: Joey to Rachel : ...but we didn't plan it. The only reason that that happened...
UNK: ...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.
Rachel : Yeah, you started it! I have got to chill.
Joey : Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened.
Joey : - But... - Oh, we feeI so terrible about this, Ross.
Joey : Yeah. But it did happen.
UNK: So...
UNK: Ross?
UNK: Ross?
Rachel : Can we just close the door?
UNK: And have you had...?
Joey : - No. No, no, no. - No. No.
Ross : But if I hadn't walked in here, would you...?
UNK: Probably- No. No.
Rachel : Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.
Rachel : You have every right to go nuts.
Ross : I'm not going nuts. Do you see me going nuts?
Rachel : No, but you know what I mean.
Ross : If you two are happy...
Ross : ...then I'm happy for you.
Ross : I'm fine.
Joey : - Really? - Absolutely.
Ross : I'm fine.
Ross : Totally fine.
Ross : I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky...
UNK: ...because, really, I'm fine.
Ross : I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing.
UNK: I mean, at first I was like :
Ross : But now that I've had time to absorb it...
UNK: Loving this.
UNK: [scene : - Ross- - It's all working out.
UNK: Me and Charlie. And you two.
Ross : - You know what we should do? - Calm ourselves?
UNK: No.
Ross : We should all have dinner.
Ross : Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!
Joey : Look, don't you think that would be a little weird?
Ross : Weird? What? What's weird?
Ross : The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food...
Ross : ...because I'm making fajitas!
Joey : I do like fajitas.
Monica : God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming.
Monica : There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.
UNK: There's so many ways to go, and this is, like, the biggest decision of our lives.
Chandler : There's a hair in my coffee.
Phoebe : Hey, guys.
Phoebe : Have you seen Frank Jr.? He's meeting me here with the triplets.
Chandler : It's funny, every time you say "triplets"...
UNK: ...I think of three hot, blond 19-year-olds.
Monica : That's sweet.
Monica : Drink your hair.
Phoebe : Hey, what's all this stuff?
Monica : They're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Phoebe : Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.
Phoebe : Get this one.
Monica : That's not really how it works.
Phoebe : - Oh, how does it work? - I don't know!
Phoebe : If you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends...
Phoebe : ...Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Monica : Thanks, that would be great.
Monica : Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
UNK: All right, all right. Remember what we talked about.
UNK: Frank Jr. : When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
UNK: Frank Jr. : That's not what we talked about!
