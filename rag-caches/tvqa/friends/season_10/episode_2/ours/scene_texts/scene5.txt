Chandler : ...I may have told him.
Monica : Oh, my God, where's my purse? No, I can replace everything in there.
Monica : - Get that binder and let's go! - Hi.
Bill : Some little snacks for everybody.
Bill : You don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
Colleen : I'll go get him in a second.
Colleen : By the way, you should know, we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
Chandler : But kids are so intuitive.

Owen : - I'm adopted? - See? Intuitive.
Bill : What? Where did you hear that?
Owen : He told me.
Owen : And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
