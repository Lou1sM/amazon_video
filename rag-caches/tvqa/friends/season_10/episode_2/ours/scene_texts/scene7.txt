Joey : It doesn't look good, does it?
UNK: I guess I made Tater Tots.
UNK: Ross, oven mitts!
UNK: Morning.
Joey : - Here you go. - Thanks.
Ross : - Did you stay here all night? - Yeah.
Ross : So you took off my pants and shoes?
Joey : No. No, no.
Joey : You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.
Joey : Look, Ross...
UNK: ...about RacheI and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that...
UNK: ...because nothing's gonna happen.
Ross : What do you mean?
Joey : She and I said from the beginning...
Joey : ...we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it.
Joey : And clearly-
Ross : What are you talking about? I'm fine.
UNK: - Are we still doing this? - No.
Joey : It's okay, Ross. You know, I totally understand.
Joey : Of course you're not fine. You're...
UNK: You're Ross and RacheI.
UNK: Yeah, except we're not.
Ross : I mean, we haven't been a couple in, like...
Ross : ...six years.
Ross : My God, is that right?
Ross : Has it been that long?
Joey : That's what I hear, yeah.
Phoebe : This is crazy. I mean, six years...
Ross : ...and because of me, you guys aren't gonna be together?
Ross : Can I ask you something?
UNK: Really...
Ross : ...what is this thing with you and RacheI?
UNK: Come on, you know me. You know...
UNK: Joey.
Joey : I'm crazy about her.
Ross : And she feels the same way?
Joey : I think so.
Ross : Well, then...
Ross : ...maybe it's time we all moved on.
Joey : Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it, so-
UNK: No, but I want to be.
Phoebe : I will be.
Ross : Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?
Phoebe : Oh, my God, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?
Ross : - She didn't see the dance, did she? - No, no, no.
Joey : No, that was- That was just for me.
Chandler : Hey, you...?
Joey : You sure about this?
Ross : Yeah, I'm sure.
UNK: And...
Joey : ...we're okay?
UNK: - Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.
UNK: We just want to give you a heads up.
Monica : - Bill and Colleen hate us. - Why?
UNK: Owen didn't know he's adopted and Monica told him.
UNK: What?
UNK: - He didn't know? He's 12. - No, he's only 8.
UNK: I'll bet he's Russian.
Phoebe : Still, he had to find out sometime.
Chandler : How would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
Chandler : I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
