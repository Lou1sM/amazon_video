UNK: Actually, Ross, I sold the boat two years ago.
UNK: Oh, no. Idiot!
UNK: Well, yeah, but I could get another one.
UNK: - This trip sounds great. - Yeah?
UNK: Okay, where do you think we can go?
Ross : My fajitas!
Rachel : Look, Charlie, I just want you to know...
Rachel : ...Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
Rachel : You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
Charlie : You know what, this is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
Charlie : I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
UNK: Fajitas! Be carefuI! Very hot plate! Very hot!
Rachel : Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on.
Ross : That is gonna hurt tomorrow.
Phoebe : Okay, well, this is crazy.
UNK: We can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
UNK: Oh, no, of course we're not.
UNK: - That's insane. - I know.
Phoebe : Alice would never go for it.
UNK: Frank Jr. : She's pretty tired too. I think we could get her on board.
UNK: Well, just for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically...
Monica : ...which one would you be willing to give up?
UNK: Frank Jr. : Frank Jr. Jr.?
UNK: Well, it'd be great for my shoulder.
UNK: Frank Jr. : You'd be getting a really good one.
UNK: Frank Jr. : He's really funny.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Like, the other day, he made up this joke :
UNK: Frank Jr. : What's green and says, "Hey, I'm a frog"?
UNK: Frank Jr. : A talking frog.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
UNK: Well, all right, that's fine. What about Leslie?
UNK: Frank Jr. : Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.
UNK: Frank Jr. : She's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
UNK: All right, so that leaves Chandler.
UNK: Frank Jr. : No, no, you can't have Chandler. No, no. She's my little genius.
UNK: Frank Jr. : I got big hopes for her.
UNK: Frank Jr. : She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.
Phoebe : Wow, Frank, I think we just ran out of kids.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Oh, I think you're right.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up.
UNK: Frank Jr. : I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
Phoebe : I'm sorry, Frank, I didn't realize things were so bad.
Phoebe : You know, I'll help out more. I can baby-sit anytime you want.
Phoebe : You name the day and I'll be there.
UNK: Frank Jr. : - How about tomorrow? - Well, that's not good.
UNK: But I can move some stuff around and I'll be there.
Phoebe : You and Alice just take the whole day together.
UNK: Frank Jr. : You'd do that for us?
Phoebe : Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
UNK: Oh, look at them.
UNK: Frank Jr. looks At The Triplets : I love you so much.
UNK: Frank Jr. looks At The Triplets : Oh, crap, don't wake up! Don't wake up!
Chandler : - Where are Bill and Colleen? - Kitchen, getting something to eat.
Monica : Can you believe how nice they are?
Chandler : We have to leave.
UNK: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Chandler : I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way.
Chandler : He didn't know he was adopted. There's a slight chance...
