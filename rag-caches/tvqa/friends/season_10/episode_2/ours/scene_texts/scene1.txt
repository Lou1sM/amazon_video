Monica : - Hi, Frank. - Hi.
Phoebe : - Good to see you. - Good to see you too.
Monica : - Hi, Frank. - Hi. Hey, how you doing?
Monica : Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big. Which one is which again?
UNK: Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...
UNK: Frank Jr. : ...pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse.
UNK: Frank Jr. : And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler.
UNK: Frank Jr. : That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
UNK: She's got quite an arm there, doesn't she? Yeah.
UNK: Hey, guys, come give me a hug.
UNK: Triplets, hug your aunt!
UNK: It's like hugging fresh cookies.
UNK: Oh, okay.
UNK: I'm gonna eat you!
UNK: So how you been, Frank?
UNK: Oh, good, you know. Life is all right. Just taking it day by day.
UNK: Seems like somebody needs something.
UNK: Oh, no. He's just trying to pull my shoulder out of it's socket.
Phoebe : - Oh, my God. - No, it's fine.
UNK: After I black out, he tries to put it back in, so...
UNK: Monica reads A Form In Her Lap : "Willing to adopt triplets?" No.
Joey : Can I just say, I know we're doing this for Ross and that's cooI.
Joey : But if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Rachel : Well, what would we be doing?
Joey : I'd take you out for a romantic night.
Joey : Some champagne, fancy dinner, feeI you up on the carriage ride home.
UNK: FeeI me up?
Joey : In a carriage.
UNK: Well, maybe we can have our date later on tonight.
UNK: You know, after this, we'll go back to our apartment...
UNK: Right, right. Yeah.
UNK: We could put on some music, light some candles, and then...
UNK: You want to say feeI me up, don't you?
UNK: I just think it's something we should do.
Joey : - Hey, Charlie! - Hi.
Rachel : - Hi. - Hey.
UNK: So...
Charlie : - ... dreading this? - Oh, you bet.
Joey : So did you bring a little something for Ross?
UNK: Actually, it's some stuff you left at my apartment.
UNK: Well, thanks.
UNK: And you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Joey : Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
Ross : I thought I heard voices.
Ross : Hi, Charlie.
UNK: Hey, Joey.
Ross : And, oh, you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.
UNK: I'm just kidding. I know RacheI. I know...
Ross : Come. Please come in. Come in.
UNK: Okay. Well, we brought you some wine.
UNK: That is so thoughtfuI.
Ross : She's a keeper.
UNK: - And what did you bring me, huh? - Actually, that's-
Ross : Underwear, a toothbrush...
UNK: ...and a Van Halen CD.
Ross : I can use all these things!
Charlie : Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little-
Ross : What? Fine? Because I am.
Ross : Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't-? You see?
Ross : Who else is fine?
Rachel : Come on.
UNK: Listen. Why don't you try to relax. Maybe have a drink.
