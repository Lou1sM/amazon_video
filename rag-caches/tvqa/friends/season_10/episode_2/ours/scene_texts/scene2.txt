Rachel : You know what, that is a very good idea.
Ross : I'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.
Phoebe : Oh, God.
Phoebe : So adorable.
Phoebe : Look at them, sleeping there like angels.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Yeah, I really cherish these moments...
UNK: ...because before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
UNK: Well, they may be a handfuI...
Phoebe : - ... but they're so cute. - Yeah.
UNK: Oh, God, last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing.
UNK: Frank Jr. : I haven't slept in four years.
Phoebe : That's a long time.
UNK: Frank Jr. : You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe.
UNK: Frank Jr. : There's just so many of them.
UNK: You know, two I could handle.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Two's great. You just hold one in each hand.
UNK: Frank Jr. : What do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on?
UNK: I got no more hands to protect my area.
UNK: Frank Jr. : There's three of them, Phoebe. Three.
Phoebe : Yeah, I know, Frank.
Phoebe : I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Sometimes, I think that-
UNK: Frank Jr. : Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it. It's too horrible. No.
UNK: What?
UNK: Frank Jr. : No, no, I can't.
Phoebe : Oh, my God, Frank. Are you thinking of leaving?
Phoebe : Because I didn't have those triplets so you could run out on them.
UNK: Frank Jr. : Oh, no, I would never do that. No. I just...
UNK: Frank Jr. : ...was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : You can't separate them, that's terrible! Which one?
Monica : Thank you so much for seeing us.
UNK: Phoebe has told us great things about you guys.
Colleen : Please, we're happy to help.
Bill : We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
Chandler : So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
Chandler : I mean, you have a lovely home.
Monica : We appreciate anything you can tell us.
Colleen : Well, actually, I think this might help.
Colleen : It's pretty much...
Colleen : - ... all the information you need. - Oh, my God.
UNK: Everything is broken into categories, then cross-referenced.
UNK: Then color-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
Monica : Thank you.
Monica : I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Bill : I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.
Bill : Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
UNK: That's great. Can I see the book?
Chandler : You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
UNK: Please. It's just so pretty and white.
Colleen : Bathroom is down the hall to your left.
Colleen : I would have told him to do it too.
Monica : Can I adopt you?
Chandler : - Hey, you must be Owen. - Yeah.
Chandler : I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the Scouts too.
Phoebe : - You were? - In fact, my father was a den mother.
Chandler : You know how to use a compass?
Owen : I have a badge in it.
Chandler : - You do? That's fantastic. - You want to see it?
Chandler : I'd love to, but I gotta get back to your parents.
Chandler : They're telling us about how they adopted you.
UNK: What?
UNK: What?
Owen : I'm adopted?
Chandler : I got nothing.
Owen : I'm adopted?
UNK: No.
UNK: I didn't say that. I said...
UNK: ...you're a doctor.
UNK: Frank Jr. : A doctor.
UNK: Hey, doctor, my arm hurts. Can you fix it for me?
UNK: I can't believe I'm adopted.
UNK: So you're not gonna fix my arm?
UNK: Well, that first batch of margaritas was not so great...
UNK: ...but this second batch is good.
Rachel : Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
UNK: Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?
Ross : You know, just the four of us.
