Chandler : Which, technically, now you should give back.
Colleen : You told him he's adopted?
UNK: I'm sorry. You should have a sign out there or something.
Chandler : Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.
Chandler : "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks Santa is reaI."
Owen : He isn't?
UNK: Chandler to Monica : We have to get out of here, baby.
UNK: What is the matter with you?
UNK: All right, look, I know what Chandler did was not the best...
UNK: ...but anyone would assume that a 12-year-old has been told he's adopted.
UNK: - Yeah, he's 8. - Wow, he's tall.
UNK: What country did you get him from?
Ross : Everyone, I would like to make a toast...
UNK: ...to RacheI and Joey.
Ross : And to love.
Ross : Ah, love!
UNK: L- O-V-E. Love.
UNK: L is for "life. "
Ross : And what is life without love?
Rachel : Oh, my God, are we supposed to answer?
UNK: O is for :
Ross : "Oh, wow!"
Ross : The V is for this...
Ross : ...very surprising turn of events...
UNK: ...which I am still fine with, by the way.
UNK: E...
Ross : ...is for how...
UNK: ...extremely normaI I find it...
Ross : ...that you two...
Ross : ...are together.
UNK: And that one day you might get married...
Ross : ...and have children of your own.
Joey : - Dude, are you okay? - Totally.
Rachel : Ross, you don't seem okay.
UNK: Ross on The Verge Of Tears : I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining.
UNK: Ross on The Verge Of Tears : I think everyone would feeI better if we had some flan.
Charlie : Wait, Ross. Ross, I- I have to take off.
Rachel : - No! - I'm sorry.
UNK: I have an early class in the morning.
Charlie : But this has been lovely.
Ross : Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey.
Ross : And that you never really liked RacheI.
Charlie : You are on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Joey : - Okay. - All right.
UNK: God, RacheI, what Ross just said, that's just-
Rachel : That's okay. Girls tend not to like me.
UNK: Fine.
Ross : Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.
UNK: Hey, that rhymes.
Rachel : You know what, Ross, I think we're gonna take off too.
Ross : Of course. God, I'm so stupid.
Ross : You guys are a couple now.
Ross : I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
UNK: - No, it's just getting late- - It's fine. It's totally fine.
UNK: I've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
Ross : I don't even know what that's for.
Rachel : You know what?
Joey : I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Rachel : - That's probably a good idea. - I'll see you in the morning.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Yeah, you know, Joey, I-
Rachel : I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
