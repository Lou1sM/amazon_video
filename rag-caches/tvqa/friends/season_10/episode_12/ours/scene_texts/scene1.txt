Rachel : Monica made me send her to my mom's.
Rachel : Apparently, babies and weddings don't mix.
Monica : Are you still crying about your damn baby?
UNK: Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving. Remember, 20 seconds per person.
UNK: You see these clowns all the time.
UNK: You must give me the name of your wedding planner.
UNK: I wanna throw a really tense party.
Joey : - Hey, you're Mike's parents, right? - Yes, we are.
Joey : Our little ones are growing up fast, aren't they?
UNK: Mike's Father : - How's that? - You know...
UNK: ...on one hand, you're happy for them. On the other, it's hard to let go.
UNK: How do you want to divide up the holidays?
UNK: I was thinking Thanksgiving at my place, Christmas at yours.
UNK: Mike's Father : Who in God's name are you?
UNK: I'm not that fond of you either, buddy. I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.
UNK: You know what? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Ross : I thought we'd be groomsmen. They would have asked us by now.
Ross : When did they ask you to be a bridesmaid?
Rachel : - November. - I wanna say it's not looking good.
Rachel : - Hey, Pheebs? - Sorry?
Rachel : You haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Phoebe : Well, they're not in the wedding.
UNK: What?
UNK: Well...
Rachel : ...this is really awkward.
Rachel : Oh, and I can leave.
UNK: I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got his brother and his friends from school.
Phoebe : So, you know, you were...
UNK: If it helps, you were next in line. You just missed the cut.
Ross : Oh, man.
Chandler : This is like figure skating team all over again.
Chandler : I mean, synchronized swimming.
Phoebe : I mean... I mean, the balance beam.
Chandler : - Help me. - Football.
Phoebe : Thank you.
UNK: Oh, Pheebs, spit that out. That has pork in it.
UNK: I thought the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian?
Monica : Yeah, I changed them. I sent you a fax about it.
Phoebe : I don't have a fax machine.
Monica : Well, then there are gonna be a few surprises.
Ross : I can't believe we're gonna be the only people not in the wedding.
Chandler : - I know. I hate being left out of things. - And it's a wedding.
UNK: It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
UNK: - Hey, guys, how's it going? - Fine.
UNK: We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Mike : Look, about tomorrow, I've got a question for you.
UNK: I found out one of my groomsmen had an emergency and can't make it.
Chandler : - What happened? - Who cares? And...?
Mike : And I was wondering if one of you guys...
Ross : - I'll do it! - Me!
Mike : You both wanna do it? There's only room for one.
Chandler : Pick me. I look great in a tux, and I won't steal focus.
Ross : No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me. I mean... Watch.
Mike : You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision.
Mike : You know, Phoebe knows you better. I'm gonna let her choose.
Ross : Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Chandler : Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...
Chandler : ...as he is me.
Ross : - Please. You're going down. - You are going "downer."
UNK: They say that on the figure skating team?
Chandler : I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
Joey : You know I'm filling in for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
Mike : - Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that. - Oh, hey, my pleasure.
Joey : So, what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
Mike : - I intend to marry her. - Oh, a wiseacre.
Joey : I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?
Joey : Isn't that kind of unstable?
Mike : - No more so than acting. - Strike two.
Mike : You're right. She probably will support me.
Mike : Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
Joey : Strike three.
Joey : You only get one more, Mike.
