UNK: Girls in my magazines are a lot nakeder.
Phoebe : Oh, hey, Joey.
Phoebe : - Hey. - Listen, I need to ask you something.
UNK: You know how my stepdad's in prison?
Joey : - Yeah. - Yeah.
Phoebe : He was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could go to the wedding.
Phoebe : But he just called and...
Phoebe : Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.
Joey : - So he can't come? - No.
Phoebe : And so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. And...
Phoebe : Well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Joey : - Seriously? - Yeah.
Phoebe : You've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me.
Phoebe : You've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom.
UNK: I am pretty "wisdomous."
Phoebe : So, what do you say?
Joey : Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Phoebe : Oh, thank you.
Phoebe : I hope...
Phoebe : I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Joey : Listen, I hope...
Joey : I hope that you know...
Joey : I don't want you to see your father cry. Go to your room!
Joey : Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.
Phoebe : It's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!
UNK: Hello? Okay, stop screaming!
UNK: Okay, so halibut.
Phoebe : All right, so salmon. Either way. I don't...
Phoebe : - It doesn't matter to me. - Well, it matters to me!
Phoebe : Well, I don't care. So you pick.
UNK: Did you just hang up on me?
Monica : All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1 800 hours.
UNK: Okay. What time is that?
Monica : You don't know military time?
Phoebe : I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
UNK: Just subtract 1 2.
UNK: Okay, so 1 800 minus 1 2...
UNK: ...is 1 788.
Monica : - Six o'clock! - Okay.
UNK: Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.
Monica : No, I said it has to be there by 4 : 00. Goodbye.
UNK: How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?
UNK: Harder than it looks.
UNK: Wait. Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy.
Phoebe : I told you, I just want a simple wedding.
Monica : Please, honey, leave the details to me.
Monica : Now, I wanna make this day as special for you as I can.
UNK: I was thinking the harpist should wear white.
Phoebe : Harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Monica : - Oh, she backed out. - She did? Why?
Monica : I made her.
Monica : Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding."
Monica : - Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent. - Hey!
Phoebe : She will shower when Tibet is free.
UNK: - Hey. You look great. - You too.
UNK: I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner. I rarely practice my meals before I eat.
Phoebe : What did we say was your one gift to us?
UNK: No stupid jokes, but I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Phoebe : Rehearse it.
UNK: Hi.
Mike : - Thanks for coming, you guys. - Oh, yeah...
Monica : I was... I was going for a handshake.
UNK: That why your hand's against my crotch?
Ross : - That is why. - Yeah.
UNK: So, Rach, where's Emma?
