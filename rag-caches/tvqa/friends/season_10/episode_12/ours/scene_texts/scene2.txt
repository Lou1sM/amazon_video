UNK: - Michael, can I see you for a moment? - Yeah, sure.
UNK: This was...
UNK: ...weird.
Phoebe : - Hi. - Hey.
UNK: What's with the face?
UNK: That Mike has got no respect. I'm not sure about him.
UNK: Wait, that's not him. There he is.
Ross : So? What did you decide?
Phoebe : I decided to pee.
Chandler : You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding.
UNK: - One of the groomsmen fell out. - Oh, no, no.
Phoebe : I can't choose between you two. I love you both so much.
Chandler : Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
UNK: Such bitterness.
UNK: Best to keep that attitude in the seats.
UNK: Come on, Pheebs. We both really want to do this, and it's up to you.
UNK: But I don't wanna choose. It's...
Phoebe : Okay, wait. Rach?
Phoebe : Listen, I have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do.
Rachel : Goody! What is it?
Phoebe : Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman...
Phoebe : ...and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
UNK: What? What, what, what? No, I don't wanna do that.
UNK: I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
Ross : I'll do it!
UNK: Okay, it's 21 00 hours.
Monica : - Time for your toast. - Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
Monica : You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike.
UNK: In regards to the toasts, okay, you wanna keep them short.
Monica : Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay.
Monica : You just get in, do your thing, and get out.
Mike : Is that what you say to Chandler?
UNK: It's 21 01, and I am not amused.
UNK: Okay.
Monica : The bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
UNK: Okay. Hello, everyone.
Phoebe : And thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event.
Phoebe : Some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.
UNK: Yeah. My friend Joey and I...
Phoebe : ...decided to fix each other up with friends. So l...
UNK: Oh, okay. I...
UNK: I thought about it, and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen...
Phoebe : ...who couldn't be here tonight, because... It's not...
Phoebe : It's not important. Well, she's in rehab.
UNK: Anyway. So Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike...
Phoebe : ...only he didn't have a friend Mike, so he just brought my Mike.
Phoebe : And... And...
Phoebe : But despite, you know... It got good.
Phoebe : I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here.
UNK: Monica rolling Her Eyes : Oh, God.
UNK: And... And moment's over.
UNK: So okay... Oh, no, forget that.
UNK: I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
Phoebe : Oh, but you need to know that to get that.
UNK: So... Oh, well, okay.
UNK: I... Okay.
UNK: Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!
Phoebe : This is my wedding, okay? I don't want this...
UNK: Or this... Or this...
UNK: Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...
Phoebe : - You know what? You're done. - What?
Phoebe : You're fired!
UNK: Cheers.
Phoebe : - Hey. - Happy wedding day.
