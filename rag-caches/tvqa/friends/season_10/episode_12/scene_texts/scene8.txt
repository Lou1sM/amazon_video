Monica : Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.
Monica : Okay, who left the ice sculpture on the steam grate?
Joey : - Michael. - Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy!
UNK: - There you go. - Hi. Hi.
Mike : I know getting married in the street isn't what you approve of.
UNK: Mike's Mom : No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
UNK: Mike's Dad : I crushed a pill and put it in her drink.
UNK: Mike's Dad : Come on, sweetheart.
Mike : You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow.
UNK: Someone has to walk him down the aisle.
Chandler : - Would this person be in the wedding? - I guess.
Ross : - I'll do it! - I'll do it!
Ross : Chandler, hello? I mean, aren't you scared of dogs?
Chandler : I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and...
Chandler : He can sense my fear! My throat is exposed!
Ross : I guess I'm in the wedding then.
Ross : He stinks.
UNK: Level one alert! I repeat, level one, this is not a drill!
UNK: We have a situation. The minister called. He's snowed in, he can't make it.
Joey : - Oh, no. - Hey, don't worry.
Joey : - I'm still ordained from your wedding. - Really?
UNK: Yeah. You think I'd give up being a minister and pay to ride the subway?
Ross : Ministers don't ride the subway for free.
Joey : I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but, yeah, we do.
Monica : We have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the aisle.
Ross : I'll do it!
Monica : Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position.
Monica : Chandler, come with me.
Monica : Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony, and Chandler's giving you away.
Phoebe : Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad.
UNK: So you ready to do this?
Phoebe : Oh, my God. This is really happening.
Rachel : - Phoebe, I'm so happy for you, honey. - Thank you.
Phoebe : I love you. Wait, wait! No hugs! The dresses!
Monica : - Oh, what the hell. - Oh, come on.
Phoebe : - I love you guys. - I love you.
UNK: Okay, it's zero hour! All teams execute on my count!
Monica : Let's get this bad boy on the road!
UNK: Is it okay I want you to wear that headset in bed?
Monica : I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Chandler : Oh, yeah.
Monica : Okay, Marjorie, hit it.
UNK: - Jeez, Ross. You could've showered. - It's the dog.
UNK: Groomsman? Why are you standing there? Where's your bridesmaid?
Monica : We've got a broken arrow! Bridesmaid down!
Monica : Oh, that's me.
Rachel : - Ready? - Okay.
Phoebe : Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait.
