Joey : Hello, Michael.
UNK: Joseph.
Joey : May I have a word with you, please?
UNK: You wanna step it up there?
Rachel : This is...
UNK: ...great.
Joey : Have a seat.
Monica : Last night...
Joey : ...I tried to welcome you into my family.
Joey : And instead, you disrespect me.
Joey : I cannot allow this.
Mike : Are you rehearsing for some really bad Mafia movie?
UNK: More back talk.
UNK: And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition...
UNK: ...for Family Honor 2 : This A-Time It's A-Personal.
UNK: Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today. What do you want?
Joey : I want you to take this seriously!
Joey : Phoebe is very, very important to me, okay?
Joey : I wanna make sure you are gonna take care of her.
Mike : Joe, I love Phoebe.
UNK: She's the most important thing in my life.
Mike : I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
Joey : That's what I wanted to hear.
UNK: Because she's family, okay?
Joey : And now you're gonna be family.
UNK: And there's nothing more important in the whole world than family.
Mike : That must have been one lousy movie.
Joey : That was me!
