UNK: All right, I got to go. I have another call, Reverend.
UNK: Hello?
Joey : - I'm glad we had this little talk. - Yes.
Mike : And thanks for all the wedding night advice.
Mike : That didn't make me uncomfortable at all.
UNK: All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.
Phoebe : - Okay. - Bye.
UNK: Did you guys know that there's a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
Phoebe : Oh, my God, what's it doing here?
Monica : I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.
Monica : - What a pickle. - Oh, my God, everything's such a mess.
Phoebe : Why is this happening to me?
UNK: How bad do you wanna stick your tongue on that?
Chandler : - How's it going? - Good.
Ross : I'm just getting some coffee so I'm alert for the wedding.
Chandler : That's what I was doing too.
Ross : Well, you have fun tonight.
Chandler : - You too. - Oh, I will.
Chandler : Me too.
Ross : Wait a minute. I know why I'm being such an ass. Why are you?
Chandler : - I'm not supposed to tell you. - I'm not supposed to tell you.
UNK: Did Rachel say you could be in the wedding?
UNK: Mike's Mother : - Yes. - She told me that too!
UNK: I don't believe this. I played the Emma card.
UNK: I looked into my soul.
Chandler : You told us both we could be in the wedding?
UNK: In my defense, you weren't supposed to tell each other!
Ross : Rachel, only one of us can do it. You have to choose.
Ross : You and me together again.
UNK: Rach, Rach? Knock-knock.
Rachel : - Who's there? - I'll tell you at the wedding.
Mike : Hey, I forgot my scarf.
Rachel : I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Mike : Oh, you haven't picked yet? Oh, good, because I had an idea.
Mike : I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog, Chappy.
Ross : What? A dog? No. Rachel gets to choose.
Rachel : Wow, this is a tough one.
Rachel : I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Phoebe : So, what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club...
Phoebe : ...but the food is not? And the drinks are there but the bartender is not?
Phoebe : Are you freaking kidding me?
Chandler : How's it going?
Chandler : - Help me. - What?
Phoebe : I want you to be crazy bitch again.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Please?
Monica : - You really want me to come back? - More than I wanna get married.
UNK: Okay, people, we are back in business!
UNK: Oh, God, I have missed you so much. Okay.
Monica : Get your hair and makeup done. I'll take care of everything.
Joey : - Hey, what are you guys gonna do? - About what?
Joey : The blizzard. I just saw on the news...
UNK: ...it's the worst snowstorm in 20 years.
Joey : They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
Monica : But the band and the photographer are coming in from New Jersey.
Joey : I don't think they are.
UNK: Looks like you're not gonna be in the wedding, either.
Ross : So sorry, Pheebs.
Monica : - Well, the club lost its power. - The news said most of the city did.
Rachel : - Since when do you watch the news? - For your information...
Joey : ...since they hired a very hot weather girl.
UNK: I can't believe you aren't getting married today.
