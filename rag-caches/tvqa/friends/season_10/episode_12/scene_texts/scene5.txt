Phoebe : - Hi. - Let's talk about this groomsman thing.
Chandler : If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the aisle just fine.
Chandler : But if you choose me...
Chandler : ...you'll be getting some comedy.
Rachel : Even so...
Rachel : ...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
UNK: Yeah, I figured you might...
UNK: ...because of the history, and you used to love him...
UNK: ...and you guys have a baby.
UNK: Well, thank you for respecting my decision.
Chandler : Let me tell you why you need to pick me.
UNK: See, when I was a kid, you know, I was always left out of everything...
Chandler : ...and it really made me feel insecure.
Chandler : I was always picked last in gym...
UNK: ...even behind that fat exchange student who didn't know the rules to baseball.
Chandler : I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.
UNK: It's just so humiliating.
UNK: I mean, you know how it feels to be left out of things, right?
Phoebe : - No. - No.
Chandler : Anyway, if I'm the only one left out of this wedding...
Chandler : ...I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Rachel : All right, fine, I pick you.
UNK: Yes!
Chandler : Make "groom" for Chandler.
Ross : Oh, my.
Phoebe : No, we're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid.
