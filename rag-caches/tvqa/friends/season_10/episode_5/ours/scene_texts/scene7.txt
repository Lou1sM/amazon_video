UNK: Did I just say, "If I were a guy"?
Monica : You don't need him to propose to you. Maybe you could propose to him.
Phoebe : Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Isn't that a little desperate?
Monica : I proposed to Chandler.
UNK: All right, moving on.
Chandler : I don't think it was desperate. It was amazing.
Monica : Thank you.
Phoebe : - Well, do you think I should propose? - I think it could be kind of great.
UNK: Absolutely. You'II love the feeling. There's nothing like it.
UNK: Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?
Monica : How about at a game on the big screen?
UNK: How about at a Foot Locker?
Monica : What? What, he obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to.
Monica : - Plus, he'd never suspect it. - Yeah, that does make sense.
UNK: - Okay, now, would you two like that? - Sounds good to me.
Chandler : But what would a guy think?
UNK: - Nana's on the phone. - Wow.
Rachel : That's interesting, since she died seven years ago.
Mike : She did?

UNK: Hello?
Rachel : It's our nanny.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Oh, God, I hope you feeI better. Okay. Bye.
Rachel : That's Molly. She's sick.
Rachel : - Can you watch Emma today? - I can't. I have back-to-back classes.
Ross : Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting.
UNK: MenstruaI cramps.
Ross : I don't think that's what this is.
Rachel : - Can any of you watch Emma? - No, I'm sorry, sweetie.
Phoebe : No, I've got work, and then I'm proposing.
Rachel : Great. Shoot. What am I gonna do?
UNK: Well, I could do it.
Rachel : - Well, actually... - Can I talk to you for a second?
Ross : I do not want her babysitting our child.
Joey : - Why not? - For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.
Rachel : - Ella's a nice name. - Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Ross : - The next one? - Okay.
Ross : I don't want her watching our baby.
Rachel : Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person.
Rachel : This is a huge breakthrough for her.
Rachel : She just offered to do something for another human being.
UNK: You know, I don't know.
Rachel : Ross, I'm telling you...
Rachel : ...she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, all right?
Rachel : Do you understand how important that is in our world?
Amy : Listen, I couldn't help but overhear, because I was trying to.
Amy : Listen, let me do this. I really want to help you guys out.
UNK: And plus, RacheI's been so wonderfuI to me.
Ross : - Absolutely. - Oh, great!
Amy : So how much does it pay?
Chandler : How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Joey : Great. I'm finished. In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Monica : - You dropped it off? - Yeah.
Chandler : Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Joey : No can do, amigo.
Joey : No, I didn't use the computer. It felt more personaI to handwrite it.
Monica : - You handwrote it? - Yeah, and don't worry.
Joey : I didn't try to sound smart at all.
UNK: See you later.
Monica : Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That letter is gonna go in our file.
