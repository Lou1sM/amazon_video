Rachel : You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Rachel : Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time.
Rachel : I've never given her a cookie.
Rachel : - Have you? - No.
Joey : No. And for the record, I've also never given her frosting from a can.
Monica : Hey, Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation...
UNK: ...and we wondered if you would write one for us?
Rachel : - Of course. I would be honored. - Thank you.
Joey : I think there's been an oversight.
UNK: We would have asked you. We thought you wouldn't be interested.
UNK: It's just that we don't think of you as really being so much with the words.
Monica : Clearly, we were wrong.
UNK: I got a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, okay?
UNK: I know how much you want to have a baby...
Joey : ...and I would love to help you get one.
Monica : You know what? Then we want you to do it.
UNK: Thank you. All right. Let me see how I'm gonna start.
UNK: "Dear Baby Adoption Decider People... "
Chandler : So excited about your letter.
Monica : - Hey. - Hey, Phoebe.
Monica : - Wow, don't you look nice. - Yes, I do.
UNK: Today's Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Rachel : What's it the anniversary of?
Rachel : Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex?
UNK: Yeah.
Chandler : So you must be going somewhere fancy to celebrate.
Phoebe : A Knicks game.
Joey : Aren't you a little overdressed?
Phoebe : I've never had a one-year anniversary before...
Phoebe : ...so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy...
Phoebe : ...I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry...
Phoebe : ...and we're gonna have sex in a public restroom.
Monica : You guys do that?
Monica : Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom.
Chandler : That's where people make number two.
