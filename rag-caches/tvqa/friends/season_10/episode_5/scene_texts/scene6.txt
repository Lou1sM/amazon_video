UNK: Your full-sized aortic pump.
Rachel : - Amy. Hi. - I took your advice.
Amy : - I left Myron. - Good for you!
Amy : I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.
Rachel : Yes, you are.
UNK: - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you.
Amy : So can I stay with you?
Rachel : But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
UNK: Look who's back.
Joey : Why do you have bags? Why does she have bags?
UNK: I'm staying with you guys.
Monica : - What? - We're gonna be roomies!
Amy : Come on.
Joey : - You slept out here? - Yeah.
Rachel : Amy kept kicking me in her sleep, yelling, "Myron, get off!"
UNK: But we're getting rid of her, right? Please tell me we're getting rid of her?
UNK: - Joey, I can't do that. - Oh, come on.
Joey : Last night I was finishing off a pizza, and she said :
UNK: "A moment on the lips, forever on the hips. "
UNK: I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
UNK: Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...
UNK: ...but I think it's really good that she's here.
UNK: Because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?
UNK: No, it's just- Look, when I first moved to this city, I was a lot like her.
Rachel : I was spoiled, self-centered. And you guys really took care of me.
Joey : Yeah. Monica made us.
UNK: Well, whatever. I really appreciate it...
UNK: ...because I don't think I would be the person I am today...
UNK: ...if it wasn't for you guys.
UNK: So I want to help Amy the way you guys helped me.
UNK: And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's okay.
Amy : - Good morning. - Yeah.
UNK: That's what I'm wearing today. That's why I hung it on the door.
UNK: Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.
Rachel : You know what? I was thinking that maybe now would be a good time...
Rachel : ...for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
UNK: Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.
Amy : I am not happy.
UNK: Sure you want to eat that?
UNK: I'm curvy and I like it!
Rachel : - Hi. - Hi.
Phoebe : I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Chandler : I doubt that. Tell her about us last year.
UNK: Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch, and he wrote me a rap song.
Ross : - Seriously? - Word.
Phoebe : Mine was worse than that.
Rachel : - Well, what happened? - We were at the game.
Phoebe : This guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing.
Rachel : - That is so tacky. - Well, that's what I said.
UNK: But it turns out Mike was planning to propose to me that same way last night.
Ross : Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?
UNK: - That's huge. - Do you want to marry him?
Phoebe : Yeah, I really do. Yes.
Phoebe : But after I dumped on the way he was gonna do it...
UNK: ...I don't think he'll ever ask again. I said no in Barbados, and now this?
Chandler : She's right. If I were a guy and...
