Amy : At least now people will know she's a girI!
Rachel : I can't believe I ever even tried to help you.
Rachel : - You are so beyond help! - You know what?
Amy : Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
Phoebe : - Excuse me? - You didn't want me...
Amy : ...to marry the old guy with the great apartment.
Amy : Then I tried to help your daughter de-emphasize her flaws...
UNK: ...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
Rachel : - Joey, where are those bags? - She has a lot of crap!
UNK: You know? When I moved in here, I thought, "This will be so great.
UNK: Just us sisters back together again like when we were kids. "
UNK: Except without that stupid Jill.
UNK: Who has gotten fat, by the way.
UNK: Seriously?
UNK: Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.
Rachel : - Hips or thighs? - Ass and face.
Ross : Oh, my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Amy : She was. Carbs found her.
Amy : See? This is what I wanted.
UNK: Two sisters talking about reaI stuff.
Rachel : Oh, I can give you that.
Amy : - You can? - Yeah.
Rachel : I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...
Rachel : You're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Monica : Thank you.
UNK: You gotta admit, Emma does look cute.
UNK: - Did you just say, "Emma"? - Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.
UNK: Sis, you wanna go bring Jill some pasta?
UNK: Come on, Amy. Now, that's just wrong.
UNK: Her true weakness was garlic bread.
UNK: That woman didn't know what she was talking about, Mike.
Phoebe : Obviously, you have balls.
UNK: - Please, let's forget the whole thing. - I would love it.
Phoebe : - Consider it forgotten. - Thank you.
Phoebe : But just so you know...
Phoebe : However and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes.
Phoebe : Whether, you know, it's at a basketball game...
UNK: ...or in skywriting...
Phoebe : ...or, you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie...
Phoebe : ...who hides it in the cake.
Phoebe : It's in the cake, isn't it?
Mike : Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
Phoebe : What's the matter with me? Why do I keep ruining this?
Phoebe : - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No, it's my fault.
Mike : I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways...
UNK: ...and I just wanna tell you I love you, and I wanna spend my life with you...
Mike : - I'm gonna do this now. - Oh, my God.
Mike : - Phoebe, I- - Wait. Oh, wait.
Phoebe : Oh, no.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Ready? Okay.
Mike : Phoebe, I love you.
UNK: There's no one else in the world I would ask to marry me three times.
UNK: But I want to take care of you...
Mike : ...have babies with you...
Mike : ...and grow old with you.
Mike : Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
UNK: Yes.
Mike : - I love you. - I love you more.
Mike : Not possible.
Mike : She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls!
UNK: So how's the baby-styling business going?
Amy : Not that great.
UNK: It's almost as if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
Rachel : That's shocking.
UNK: There's Ross. Hey, Ross.
UNK: Hello, Ross?
Amy : He's rude.
