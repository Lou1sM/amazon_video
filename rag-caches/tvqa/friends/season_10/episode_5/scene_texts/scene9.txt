Chandler : - They loved it. - What?
Chandler : They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the letter.
Monica : They thought Joey was a child?
Chandler : She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Rachel : - Hi. - Hey, what'd you guys do today?
Amy : Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
Chandler : - That sounds like fun. - Yeah, not really.
Amy : Babies are dull.
UNK: - Hey. Hi, how's my girI? - I'm fine.
Amy : And I got you a present for letting me stay with you.
Amy : - Ready? - Yeah.
Rachel : You pierced her ears?
Amy : Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Rachel : You pierced her ears?
Rachel : How could you do this without telling me?
Amy : If I had told you, then it wouldn't have been a surprise, now would it?
Chandler : I think she looks cute.
Chandler : But I am wrong.
Monica : Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Amy : Why, did something happen to his falafeI cart?
Ross : - Hey, guys. - Ross!
UNK: Hi, Emma. Why is she wearing her hat so low?
Ross : - She can barely see. - I don't really want her to see.
Joey : Why not?
Monica : Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Chandler : Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?
Chandler : It was in a milk carton, but it looked like meat?
UNK: Come here. Come here.
Ross : There she is. Hi.
Monica : - What? - Nothing.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: What-?
Ross : - Please tell me those are clip-ons! - Oh, they're reaI.
UNK: Did she do this to her?
Ross : I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
Rachel : I know, I know. And you were right, Ross.
UNK: Okay? You are so irresponsible! I am never letting you babysit again!
Monica : You know what? This kid needs me, okay?
UNK: - She needs to have a cooI, fun aunt. - I'm a cooI, fun aunt.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Hey! Monica can be cooI and fun at organized indoor projects.
UNK: AII I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life.
Rachel : This is how you repay me?
UNK: I don't need you to help me. I already know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Rachel : - Oh, yeah? Since when? - Since today.
Amy : I am going to be a baby stylist.
Monica : - What? - That's not a thing!
Amy : Well, it should be.
Amy : I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize...
Amy : ...what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming.
Rachel : - Babies don't care if they're slim! - Enter Amy.
UNK: - Amy, I- I just- I just wanna- - What? What are you gonna do?
UNK: No more falafeI for you!
Mike : Great game, huh?
