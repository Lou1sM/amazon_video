Ross : - And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Monica : - Oh my God!
UNK: - What did you say? - Nothing! What do you say to that?
Phoebe : - Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! - No way!
Joey : - You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
UNK: - What? - Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Phoebe : - Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together...
UNK: ...If she did, she might feel differently.
Phoebe : She might not even go.
UNK: - You really think so? - I'm telling you!
Phoebe : Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.
UNK: Don't take no for an answer.
UNK: - Don't let love fly away. - Hi!
Phoebe : - Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Rachel : - Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Joey : - Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Rachel : - No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first,
UNK: and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Phoebe : - Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Rachel : - Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins?
Rachel : Good luck, Emma!
Ross : - Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
UNK: - Ross, wait, wait! - What? What?
Joey : - Could you get me a muffin?
UNK: - Rachel ? - Yeah?
Gunther : I know you're leaving tonight, ...but I just have to tell you...
Gunther : ...I love you.
Gunther : I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but..
UNK: ...I thought you should know.
UNK: Gunther...
UNK: I love you too. Probably not in the same way,...
Rachel : ...but I do. And,
UNK: or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun,
Rachel : I'll think of you.
UNK: - Oh... Bye guys. - Bye.
Monica : - Oh my God!
Monica : - Unbelievable!
UNK: - Hey, you know what might help? - I'm not getting you a muffin!
Monica : - Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Erica : - Maybe.
Chandler : Unless they're like two people
UNK: who have lived in apartments next to each other for years,
UNK: and then one day, they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Nurse : We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
Monica : - There's something that we wanna tell you.
UNK: We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Erica : - Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Monica : - Son of a gun, it is!
Erica : - Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest.
UNK: I'm really glad I picked you guys.
Erica : You're gonna make great parents.
Erica : Even Chandler.
UNK: - Okay, well, bye! - Bye!
Monica : - We'll call you!
Chandler : - Have fun at church-camp!
UNK: - Oh, look at these little bunnies! - I know!
Chandler : You ready to trade?
Chandler : - We could trade later.
Monica : - Yeah, I'm good.
Phoebe : - Hey, what are you working on?
Joey : - It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
