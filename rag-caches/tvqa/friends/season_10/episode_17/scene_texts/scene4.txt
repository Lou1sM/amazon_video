Phoebe : - How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
Joey : - No, I sat in the paint.
Phoebe : - Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
Ross : - No, and I'm not going to.
UNK: - What? - Why not?
Ross : - Because she's just going to shoot me down.
UNK: You guys saw what happened with Gunther.
Ross : That did not look like fun.
Phoebe : - How can you compare yourself to Gunther?
UNK: I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way.
Phoebe : You have a relationship with her,
UNK: - you slept together last night! - Yeah, and she still wants to go!
Ross : It's pretty clear where she is.
Joey : - Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes... - Uh, Joe?
Joey : - Damn it!
Ross : - Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now.
Ross : Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Phoebe : - No, you don't! She's going to Paris!
UNK: She is going to meet somebody.
Phoebe : Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris?
UNK: It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
Phoebe : - Hey! What do you have there?
Mike : Oh, I made a little something.
UNK: If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
Ross : - Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Phoebe : - Honey, that's gorgeous!.
Joey : - You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Rachel : - Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here.
UNK: I can't believe they're not home yet!
Rachel : I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Joey : - Monica just called from the cab.
UNK: She said they should be here any minute.
Joey : And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Phoebe : - Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby...
Phoebe : was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
Joey : Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Monica : - Oh my God!
UNK: - Okay, okay, awkward question :
UNK: The hospital knows you took two, right?
Monica : - Yes, it's twins!
Joey : - Oh, they're so cute!
Joey : Now, what, what kinds are they?
Monica : This is a boy,
Monica : and that's a girl.
Chandler : - Her name is Erica.
Joey : - Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica!
Chandler : - Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Monica : - Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Ross : - Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Phoebe : - Oh, Jack Bing. I love that.
UNK: it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know?
UNK: Jack Bing, Morning Gazette :
UNK: "I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
Rachel : Wow, so beautiful.
Mike : I want one.
Chandler : - Oh yeah?
Phoebe : Well, tell me which one,
UNK: and I'll try slip it in my coat.
UNK: Seriously.
Mike : Wanna make one of those?
