UNK: and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And...
UNK: And now I'm just sitting here and thinking
UNK: ...of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't.

UNK: ...Because of course I do.
UNK: ... I love you....
UNK: ...I love you...
UNK: ...I love you...

Chandler : - Look around, you guys... this was your first home.
Chandler : ...And it was a happy place... ....filled with love and laughter...
UNK: .. But more important..
Chandler : .. because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Phoebe : - Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
UNK: - Oh yeah ! - That's true.
UNK: - Uh, I haven't. - Wait a minute.
Monica : What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma,
Monica : And you tried to make it as a dancer?
Ross : - Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Monica : - Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Phoebe : I guess this is it.
UNK: Yeah.
Joey : - Yeah. I guess so.
Monica : - This is harder than I thought it would be.
Chandler : - Oh, it's gonna be okay.

Monica : - We got some time.
Rachel : - Okay, should we get some coffee?
Ross : - Sure.
UNK: Where?
