Monica : - Alright. My job here is done.
Chandler : - That was... Impressive.
Joey : - Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Monica : - Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
UNK: Alright, I have to get back to the babies.
Monica : I'll see you girls later.
Chandler : - Sorry about the table, man.
Chandler : - You gonna buy a new one?
Rachel : - Probably not.
Joey : ...Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Chandler : - Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Chandler : - Aww, we were worried about you!
UNK: I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
