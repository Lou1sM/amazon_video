UNK: - We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift,
UNK: but now we understand you were doing this!
Joey : - Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but
UNK: for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Chandler : - Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
UNK: - Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.
Monica : Bird feces.
Joey : - Yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Chandler : - Oh, don't worry, we'll find them. - Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Monica : - Oh God! What did I just step on?
Chandler : - It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Joey : - You stepped on my egg roll?
Monica : - I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor!
Joey : - Just put it on a plate and leave!
UNK: - Okay, let's find these birds. - Okay.
Joey : - Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Joey : - Oh! They're in the table!
Chandler : - Well, that can't be good!
Joey : - We gotta get them out of there! - How?
UNK: - Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Chandler : - Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey : - Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Chandler : - Joey, wait! The ball!
Monica : - Oh God!
UNK: - So what do we do? - I don't know.
Chandler : - Maybe we can open this up somehow. - Okay.
Chandler : - No... It's all glued together.
Joey : - Does that mean we have to bust it open? - I don't know. Maybe.
UNK: - Oh my God! - I know! It's..
Chandler : It's the foosball table.
UNK: - All right, you know what? We don't have a choice.
UNK: It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie,
Joey : if I'd gotten the part.
UNK: "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out!
UNK: Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...
UNK: ... my time-machine."
UNK: - Did that movie ever get made? - It did not.
Phoebe : - Ross, where are you going?
Ross : - To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Phoebe : - What? are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate?
UNK: Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Ross : - Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Phoebe : - You have to get a ticket to get past security.
Ross : - What? We're never gonna make it! - Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
Ross : - Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
UNK: Madame, your passport please?
Rachel : - Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French,
Rachel : but I understood every word you just said!
UNK: Gate Attendant #1 : Your boarding pass, please.
Rachel : - Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh,
Rachel : I can't believe this.
UNK: Gate Attendant #1 : - Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass... - I have it, I have it, I have it.
UNK: okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C,
Rachel : because that's my bra-size.
