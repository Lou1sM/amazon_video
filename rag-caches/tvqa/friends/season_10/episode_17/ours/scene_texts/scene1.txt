Chandler : - So,...
Chandler : Any plans for the summer?
Erica : - I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Chandler : - Hah. May not wanna mention this.
UNK: So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know;
Chandler : going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
UNK: - What? - Well, it's just interesting.
UNK: You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
Chandler : - One of life's great, unanswerable questions.
UNK: I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things?
Chandler : Like this..
UNK: - Come in. - Morning.
Phoebe : What's that?
Joey : - It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Phoebe : - It's a baby chick and duck!
Joey : - Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Phoebe : - I did not see that coming.
Joey : - Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house you know? It has that big backyard.
Joey : And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm
Joey : that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
UNK: Yes!
Joey : - Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Phoebe : - That is the rule, though.
Phoebe : - Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
UNK: What?
Joey : - Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Monica : - Oh my God!
Phoebe : - Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Ross : - Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Phoebe : - Have you seen him throw a ball?
Ross : - Is Rachel here?
Joey : - Uh, I think she's still asleep.
UNK: Hey, how did it go with you guys last night?
Joey : She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Ross : we worked things out.
Phoebe : - What's that smile?
Phoebe : Did something happen with you two?
Ross : - Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell...
UNK: but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Joey : - Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Ross : - I know, it's pretty great.
Joey : - So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Ross : - Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
Phoebe : - But do you wanna get back together?
Erica : - I don't know.
Ross : It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right.
Ross : When I was holding her, I mean... I never wanted to let her go.
UNK: You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
UNK: Yay!
UNK: Yay!
Joey : - So, so is she still going to Paris?
Ross : - Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Phoebe : - Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever!
UNK: You guys might get back together,
Phoebe : Monica and Chandler are getting their baby,
UNK: there are chicks and ducks in the world again!
Phoebe : Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!
UNK: "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
UNK: - Morning! - Guess we'll never know how it ends.
UNK: - Hey. How did you sleep? - Good. You?
UNK: - Good. - I bet you did!
Ross : - Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Joey : - Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Rachel : - Chick and the duck? Didn't they die... - Dive!
Phoebe : Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
UNK: Morning.
Rachel : - You too.
Rachel : Last night was just wonderful.
Rachel : - It really was.
Rachel : - I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Ross : - I know, me too.
Ross : You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen,
UNK: and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
Rachel : - Uh-huh. I know. It was just,
Rachel : it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
