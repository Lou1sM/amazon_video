Tape : - Good job. - Thank you.
All : - Hey. - Hey, Joey.
Phoebe : Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday, and I thought about it a lot.
UNK: No, I was too impatient. So let's try it again.
Joey : That's okay. I don't need your help.
Joey : I worked on it myself, and I gotta say I am pretty good.
Phoebe : - Really, can I hear some of it? - Sure, sure.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: See?
UNK: You, you're not...
Phoebe : You're not... You're...
Phoebe : Again, you're not speaking French!
Joey : Oh, well, I think I am. Yeah, and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Phoebe : How could you possibly think that?
Joey : The guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Ross : Hey, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
UNK: Sure.
Ross : You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
UNK: - You sure you're all right? - Yep.
UNK: Okay.
Ross : Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
Rachel : - FYI. - There it is.
Rachel : In the future...
Rachel : ...when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.
UNK: Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?
Ross : - I was just trying to do the right thing. - Really?
UNK: If you had done the right thing...
UNK: ...I wouldn't have woken up feeling stupid and embarrassed.
UNK: I would've woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
Joey : - Well... - Oh, stop that!
Ross : I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy.
Ross : I treated you with respect and understanding.
Rachel : Oh, that is so hot.
ross : Hey, I was looking out for you.
UNK: Oh, really? Well, you know what? I am a big girl.
Rachel : I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
UNK: I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot of times before. This is the worst ever!
Rachel : Oh, really? Really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
UNK: Okay, you know...? Hey, hey, you know what?
Ross : To avoid this little thing in the future...
Ross : ...let's just say you and me? Never having sex again.
Phoebe : - What? - That's right! Sex is off the table!
Ross : I am never having sex with you again!
Ross : Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
Chandler : - Hey. How was lunch? - We had a good time.
Erica : By the way, I wanted to ask you something.
Erica : It would really mean a lot to me if the baby was a boy...
Erica : ...that you name him after my father...
Erica : ...Jiminy Billy Bob.
Rachel : - Oh, really? - No!
Erica : You were right. That was fun.
Erica : I'm gonna go finish packing.
Chandler : - So is she gonna take the test? - No, she doesn't have to.
Monica : - I found out who the father is. - Oh, God.
UNK: - It's Shovely Joe, isn't it? - No, it's not.
Chandler : How do you know?
UNK: Erica didn't pay attention in sex ed class...
UNK: ...because the things she did with that prison guy?
UNK: lt'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
UNK: Oh, God, what was it? The thing we hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?
Chandler : The thing we never do.
Chandler : Shovely Joe.
Director : - Whenever you're ready, Joey. - Right.
UNK: Casting Assistant : - I'm sorry, what's going on? - Dude, come on, French it up.
Director : Joey, do you speak French?
UNK: That's not French.
UNK: Neither is that.
Joey : You know what? I think this audition is over.
