Rachel : Excuse me?
Phoebe : I was passing by when I heard this man speaking...
Director : You really think this man is speaking French?
Director : Good job, little buddy.
Director : That was some really good French.
Director : But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
Joey : - All right, but my French was good? - It was great.
UNK: See?
Ross : - Emma's down for the night. - Oh, good.
UNK: - So I guess I'm gonna take off. - Okay.
Rachel : Hey, listen, just before you go...
UNK: I just wanna say thank you for coming with me.
Ross : Oh, no problem.
UNK: And also, you know, l...
Rachel : I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing...
Rachel : Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Ross : Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Rachel : It's a shame, though. When we did it, it was pretty good.
UNK: Yeah.
Ross : Yeah, that's true.
UNK: Hey, do you remember that one really great time?
Erica : - Oh, yeah! - You know?
UNK: - It was Valentine's Day. - It was your birthday.
Erica : - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.
Rachel : Well, I guess that's all in the past now.
Rachel : - Not even one more time. - Not even once.
Rachel : - No matter how much we want it. - Even if we want it...
Phoebe : ...really bad. - That's what we decided.
UNK: Right.
UNK: - It's kind of hard, though. You know? - Yeah.
Rachel : When two people have a connection, you know, that's...
Rachel : Just seems like...
Rachel : ...such a...
UNK: ...waste.
Ross : I hate waste.
Monica : - Ross? - Yes?
Rachel : Just so you know...
Rachel : ...with us...
Rachel : ...it's never off the table.
Ross : Damn it, it's never off the table.
Phoebe : - Okay, can you really tap-dance? - No.
Phoebe : - Archery? - No.
Phoebe : - Horseback riding? - Would fall off a lot.
Phoebe : You can drink a gallon of milk in 1 0 seconds?
Joey : That I can do.
Phoebe : Come on, you can drink a gallon of milk in 1 0 seconds?
UNK: All right, watch me.
Joey : - Okay, you time me, ready? - Ready, go!
Phoebe : You did it!
