UNK: You should walk to the top of the Statue of Liberty.
Erica : - Oh, yeah, let's do that. - Great.
UNK: This baby better be really good.
UNK: Hi. Excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
UNK: - And I'm Dr. Ross Geller. - Ross, please, this is a hospital.
Rachel : That actually means something here.
UNK: - So can we please go in? - Absolutely.
Ross : Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here...
Ross : ...because my throat is feeling a little scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.
Rachel : - Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him. - I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.
UNK: - He's under sedation, so he's out. - I'm feeling better.
Ross : Oh, my God.
Rachel : That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
UNK: Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
UNK: Oh, great. Are you gonna be okay?
UNK: - He's unconscious. We'll be just fine. - Okay.
Ross : - Did the TV wake you? - No.
UNK: When you put your feet up on my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
UNK: Dr. Green : What are you doing here, Geller?
Ross : Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second.
Ross : - So, what's new? - Oh, I had a little heart attack.
Ross : Right. Is it painful?
UNK: Dr. Green : What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
UNK: Let's see if we can get that Rachel back in here.
UNK: Dr. Green : So, what's new with you? Knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
Ross : Nope. Just the one. Rach!
UNK: Daddy, hi. You're awake.
UNK: - How are you? - I'm okay.
UNK: By the way, Ross has been of great comfort.
UNK: They want to keep you here for a couple more nights.
Phoebe : I know.
UNK: But I'm gonna go home and get a bunch of your stuff...
UNK: ...so that you're really comfortable.
UNK: Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
UNK: It's pretty ironic, huh?
UNK: You being a heart surgeon, and you had a heart attack.
UNK: It'd be like if I was eaten by an Allosaurus.
UNK: I'm gonna wait outside.
UNK: "He's pretty much out."
UNK: No!
UNK: Okay, maybe if we just break it down.
UNK: Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time. Okay, so repeat after me.
UNK: Great! Okay, faster.
