UNK: Hi!
All : - Hey! - Hi!
Rachel : - How was the honeymoon? - Oh, incredible!
UNK: Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach.
UNK: It was so romantic.
Chandler : - Where's Mike? - He's at the doctor.
UNK: He didn't poop while we were there.
UNK: Shoot, I wasn't supposed to tell you that.
UNK: I mean... Okay, he's at a gig.
UNK: A gig we are definitely not going to.
UNK: - I'm glad you're back. I need your help. - Oh, why, what's up?
Joey : I have an audition for this play, and I have to speak French...
Monica : By the way, how was that yearlong dig in Cairo?
UNK: It was okay.
Rachel : I did not know you spoke French.
Rachel : You're so sexy.
Joey : - Well, so will you help me? - Sure.
Rachel : Seriously, stop it. I'm gonna jump on you.
All : - Hey. - Hi.
Chandler : Why are you wearing my apron?
Monica : I'm making cookies for Erica.
UNK: We have to leave soon. Her plane comes in in about an hour.
UNK: When she gets here, is it okay if I introduce you two as my wife...
UNK: ...and the woman who's carrying my child?
UNK: No?
UNK: Divorce?
All : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: - You know where Rachel is? - Haven't seen her since morning.
UNK: It's unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me a half-hour ago with Emma.
All : - Hey! - Hey!
Monica : - These are for Erica! - She's gonna eat all those cookies?
UNK: Well, I want the baby to come out all cute and fat!
Ross : - So why is Erica coming to visit? - We wanna get to know her better.
Monica : She's never been to New York, so she wants to see the tourist spots :
Monica : Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building.
Chandler : There's always so many people, and they're being corralled like cattle.
Chandler : And, you know, there's always some idiot who goes, "Moo."
Monica : Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
UNK: - You should take her to a museum. - Oh, please.
UNK: So I can hear Chandler say over and over again :
UNK: "You call this art? I could make that."
UNK: It was a tower of sponges.
Ross : Oh, hi. Hi. Thanks for showing up 30 minutes late.
Ross : No, I'm sure you have a great excuse. What was it, a hair appointment?
Ross : A mani-pedi? Was there a sale at Barneys?
UNK: My father had a heart attack.
UNK: While I was at Barneys.
UNK: - Oh, my God, Rach. - Honey?
Chandler : - I'm so sorry. - Is he okay?
UNK: Yeah, he's gonna be fine, but he's heavily sedated.
UNK: Okay, I'm gonna go to Long Island with you.
Ross : - I mean, you can't be alone right now. - No, come on, I'm totally okay.
Rachel : I don't need you to come.
Rachel : - I can totally handle this on my own. - Still, still, let me come for me.
UNK: Okay. If you really need to.
Ross : I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Rachel : Oh, I really could.
