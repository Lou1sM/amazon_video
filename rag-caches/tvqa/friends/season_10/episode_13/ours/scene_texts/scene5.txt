Erica : Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
UNK: I'm glad. Listen, I wanna apologize about Chandler, though.
Monica : - I just did not see this coming. - New York is awesome!
Monica : - What is with you? - I've been to these places before...
Chandler : ...but I've never really seen them.
UNK: Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.
UNK: Let's go to a Broadway show. Cats!
UNK: I think we've done enough.
UNK: Honey, these are actors dressed like cats who sing like people.
UNK: I mean, come on!
UNK: - Thank you for showing me around. - Oh, it was our pleasure.
