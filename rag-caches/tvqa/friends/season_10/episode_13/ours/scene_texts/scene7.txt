Monica : - Are you awake? - Of course I'm awake.
Chandler : Assume from now on that I'm always awake.
UNK: All right, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Chandler : Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel killer.
UNK: Well, all right, let's say that it is him.
Monica : Would we not want the baby? No.
Monica : - Would we treat him any differently? - I'd keep an eye on him.
Chandler : We have to find out who the father is.
Rachel : - How? - I don't know.
UNK: - They have tests for these things, right? - Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.
Chandler : Easy for you to say. He's a father killer.
UNK: He probably loves his mommy.
Chandler : He's probably got a tattoo that says "Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.
Tape : We'll now count from one to five.
