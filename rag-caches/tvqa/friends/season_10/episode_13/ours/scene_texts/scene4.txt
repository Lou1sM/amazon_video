UNK: - Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you. - What are you doing?
Phoebe : I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
Joey : Don't go, I need you! My audition is tomorrow!
UNK: Hey. I was gonna make us some dinner...
Ross : ...but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.
Ross : I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Rachel : - Did you call your parents? - Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Rachel : Oh, good.
Phoebe : - What? - I just can't believe...
UNK: ...l'm in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel : - You've been in my room before. - Yeah, sure, right.
UNK: Like I'd ever be in Rachel Green's room.
UNK: Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: - You okay? - Yeah.
UNK: - Yeah, you had a rough day. - Yeah.
UNK: It's just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean, he's a doctor.
Rachel : You don't expect doctors to get sick.
Ross : But we do.
UNK: He's gonna be okay, Rach.
Rachel : I don't want him to wake up alone. I should go to the hospital.
UNK: - What? No, no. Hey, hey, look. - What?
Ross : They gave him a lot of medication.
Ross : He wouldn't even know if you were there.
Ross : We'll go see him first thing in the morning.
Rachel : - Really? I shouldn't feel guilty? - No... God, hey.
Ross : Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, okay?
UNK: - Right now you need to get some rest. - Okay, maybe you're right.
Ross : Good night.
Rachel : Wait, wait, wait.
Rachel : Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Phoebe : - Sure. - Okay.
Rachel : - Thank you for coming with me today. - Oh, of course.
Rachel : Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.
Ross : Me too. Come here.
UNK: I just don't wanna be alone tonight.
UNK: Okay, well, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or...
Ross : No, Rach!
Ross : I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea.
UNK: Well, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
UNK: Look...
Ross : You are upset about your father, and you're feeling vulnerable...
Ross : ...and I just don't feel it would be right.
UNK: I feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
UNK: What...? Taking advantage? I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!
Ross : Look, I'm sure it would be great...
UNK: ...but I think one of us has to be thinking clearly.
Ross : So I'm gonna go.
UNK: Okay.
Ross : I'll see you in the morning.
UNK: I haven't had sex in four months. I should get a medal for that!
