Monica : We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
UNK: Well, if there's anything else you wanna know...
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Can we ask you some questions about the father?
Erica : Oh, sure. Yeah.
UNK: Well, he was my high-school boyfriend, captain of the football team, really cute.
UNK: - Got a scholarship and went to college. - That's great.
Erica : Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
Monica : How's that, now?
UNK: Well, there's a chance it's another guy.
UNK: I mean, I've only ever been with two guys...
UNK: ...but they sort of overlapped.
Chandler : So, what does the other guy do?
Chandler : - Does he go to college too? - No, he's in prison.
Monica : Was he falsely accused of something?
UNK: No.
Erica : He killed his father with a shovel.
Erica : Other than that, he's a great guy.
Chandler : I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
