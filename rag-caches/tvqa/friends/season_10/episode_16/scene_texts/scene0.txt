Joey : All right, let's play one more time, okay?
Joey : And remember, if I win, you do not move to Paris.
UNK: Okay. I can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on.
Rachel : All right, Joe, you remember the rules. Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.
Joey : Just flip.
Rachel : - Tails! - Damn it!
Chandler : So we thought we'd throw you a little going-away party around 7.
Rachel : Oh, that sounds good.
Monica : Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow. Shouldn't you be packing?
Rachel : - It's all done. - Oh, yeah, right.
Monica : And after I took a shower this morning, I just threw my towel on the floor.
Monica : - Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it. - I know.
Rachel : Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom.
Rachel : This is Emma's Paris stuff. These are the boxes that I'm having shipped...
Rachel : ...and that's the sandwich I made for the plane.
UNK: Which could've used a little more mustard.
UNK: - Okay, so you've done some good work. - Yeah.
Monica : What about your carryons?
Rachel : Oh, well, everything that I need is in here...
Rachel : ...and my travel documents are on the counter...
Rachel : ...organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Monica : Oh, my God. I have nothing left to teach you.
Chandler : - Where's your passport? - It should be next to my plane ticket.
Chandler : - Well, it's not. - What? Well, maybe I put it in here?
Rachel : Oh, it's not in there!
Rachel : Oh, no, I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Monica : - Here, let me help you. - Shoot.
Rachel : I can't believe I did this.
