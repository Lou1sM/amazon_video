Rachel : None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last 1 0 years...
Rachel : ...would have happened if it wasn't for you.
UNK: No one has been more like a sister to me.
Monica : I know what you mean.
Monica : You're like a sister to me too.
UNK: I don't know what I'm going to do without you.
UNK: You're the greatest friend I ever had.
Rachel : - seeing you every day.
UNK: What?
UNK: l... l... l...
UNK: - see you every day!
Monica : That is so sweet!
Ross : Oh, no, she took down Monica.
Ross : And I'm the crier in the family.
Ross : Oh, God, I could be next.
UNK: Maybe she won't talk to me if it looks like we're deep in conversation.
Ross : Oh, so that thing you said about the thing...
Ross : ...it really made me think about that other thing.
UNK: [scene : - Rach? - Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.
Joey : I really made you think about that thing, huh?
Chandler : Rach, I think I have something that belongs to you.
Rachel : I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
Chandler : No, no, they're really yours. We found them in your old room.
Monica : These aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Chandler : Don't say Richard.
Chandler : Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Rachel : I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Rachel : - Pheebs! - Yeah!
Chandler : I think these are yours.
Phoebe : These are not mine. Look how flimsy they are. Come on.
UNK: My God, you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these...
Phoebe : ...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Rachel : - Can I talk to you alone for a minute? - Sure.
Chandler : You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes do you?
Phoebe : Where do you think Mike really is?
Rachel : Oh, honey...
UNK: Let me just saying something because once we get into this...
UNK: ...l'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke.
UNK: I just want to say that l... I love you.
Chandler : And I'm gonna miss you.
Chandler : And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Rachel : Oh, you know what?
Rachel : Let's not say anything else.
Rachel : I love you.
Chandler : Not so tight.
UNK: - I'm sorry, give me one more chance. - Okay.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I'm sorry. Just go. Just go. I can't. I can't.
UNK: - So I guess you're next. You ready? - I don't think so.
UNK: Oh, you're definitely not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Monica : You cried yesterday at the 6 : 00 news.
Chandler : That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Ross : God, I can't believe she saved me for last.
Ross : Why are they taking so long?
Phoebe : I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.
Joey : - No! - No! Joey!
Ross : Okay, here we go.
Rachel : - Well... - Yeah.
Rachel : I think I'm gonna take off.
UNK: I have such a big, big day tomorrow, so...
UNK: [scene : - Rach. - Yeah?
UNK: Aren't you forgetting something?
UNK: - Oh, right. Ross. - Yes?
UNK: I forgot to write your mom a birthday card. Would you please do that for me?
