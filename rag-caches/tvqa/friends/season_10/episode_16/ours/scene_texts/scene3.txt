Chandler : - Hey. - Hey.
Ross : - Where's Rach? - She's putting Emma down.
Joey : She'll be over in a second. It just hit her that she's leaving.
Joey : She's kind of emotional, so no one say anything to set her off, okay?
Monica : - Hey, Rach. - Hey.
UNK: There she is.
UNK: Rachel crying : Hi, you guys.
Joey : What did I just say?
UNK: Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.
Monica : - Come here, I'll make you a drink. - Okay.
Ross : Oh, man, I can't believe she's actually leaving.
Ross : How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Chandler : I know, she's been such a big part of my life.
Chandler : It feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.
Chandler : I mean...
Chandler : Forget it, I miss Melrose Place.
UNK: Joey to Ross : - I had a chance to stop her too. - Yeah?
UNK: Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row? You know?
UNK: Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.
Joey : Wait a minute.
Chandler : - Yes, Joe? - I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.
UNK: So you doing okay?
Rachel : Well, I've been better. You guys are gonna come visit, right?
Phoebe : Yes! You know, in six months, the statute of limitations runs out...
Phoebe : ...and I can travel internationally again.
Rachel : - I'm gonna miss you so much. - I know.
UNK: You know what? I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...
UNK: ...to each of you. I was gonna save it till the end of the night, but come here.
Ross : Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Joey : If I had to guess, I'd say...
UNK: ...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap, and Phoebe's doing the punching.
Rachel : Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
UNK: Okay, well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you presents...
Phoebe : ...but I do have something for you.
UNK: - What is it? - Well, it's a cotton swab...
Phoebe : ...with a bit of my saliva on it...
Phoebe : ...so that if they perfect the cloning process while you're over there...
Phoebe : ...you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs.
Rachel : I'm gonna throw this away...
Rachel : ...but thank you so much for the gesture.
UNK: Chandler?
Monica : I was just in our bedroom, and I found these on my pillow.
UNK: Oh, yes, I decided to leave those out for you in case Richard stops by...
UNK: ...and you want to engage in a little light bondage and mustache play.
UNK: What? These aren't mine.
Monica : Oh, yeah, right!
Chandler : Good luck getting another scarf dance from me.
Monica : That would be a terrible punishment.
Monica : But I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Chandler : Really? Then what are they doing in our guest room?
Monica : Rachel used to live in that room.
Chandler : Rachel. With handcuffs.
UNK: Interesting.
Monica : Joey's bare ass.
Chandler : Well played.
Rachel : - I love you, Phoebe. - I love you too.
UNK: Please...
Phoebe : Please don't...
Phoebe : Don't turn into, you know, a French bitch.
Erica : I won't.
UNK: All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this, I better keep going.
UNK: Monica to Ross : - Okay. - Okay.
UNK: [scene : - Monica? - Yeah?
UNK: - Will you come with me for a minute? - Sure.
Phoebe : - Are you wearing waterproof mascara? - No.
Phoebe : Oh, you're so screwed.
UNK: Hey.
Ross : What was that all about?
Phoebe : She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Ross : Are you kidding? Oh, my God.
Phoebe : Yeah, I know. It's gonna be even worse for you. God.
UNK: Well, just get ready to do some serious crying.
UNK: Man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.
Ross : Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year.
Ross : And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Rachel : Mon. Okay.
UNK: I better just say what it is I'm gonna say.
