UNK: - Oh, here, have a seat. - Yeah.
Phoebe : - How was your night? - Oh, it was okay.
Erica : I went to a movie with my cousin then out for dinner.
Erica : We went to this place that had...
Erica : Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
Monica : - Erica, are you okay? - Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
UNK: I keep getting these stomachaches. They come and go every few minutes.
Monica : - Oh, my God. - Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.
UNK: She doesn't have a stomachache! She's in labor!
Monica : - Oh, my God! - Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!
Monica : Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go! Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!
Monica : Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.
Monica : We're gonna have a baby!
Monica : Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby!
UNK: Oh, God, I've gotta sit down! I've gotta sit down!
Chandler : - Honey, it's gonna be okay. - You can do this. Just breathe.
Monica : Okay. Okay.
Monica : Okay, I feel a little better.
Erica : Are you sure?
Monica : - Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go. - Okay.
UNK: - Come on, let's go. - Okay, bye, everyone!
UNK: - We're having a baby! - Good luck!
Joey : - Chandler, wait, wait, wait! - What?
Joey : If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
UNK: "Dear, Judy.
UNK: Happy birthday, love Rach..."
UNK: No. You know what? I'm not doing this.
UNK: You think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Ross : That's what it seemed like.
UNK: I cannot believe that after 1 0 years you do not know one thing about me!
Ross : - Then why didn't you say something? - Because it is too damn hard, Ross!
Rachel : I can't even begin to explain to you how much I am gonna miss you.
Rachel : When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go.
Rachel : Okay? So if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you...
Rachel : ...because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong.
Rachel : It's because you mean more to me.
Rachel : So there, all right? There's your goodbye!
UNK: [scene : - Rach! - What?
Ross : - You keep... You can't... - What?
Joey : - A little more. - Okay.
Joey : - A little more. A little more. - All right.
Joey : Little more.
UNK: - All right. All right, let's do this. - All right, ready?
UNK: Yep. Now give me your best shot.
UNK: All right. Here goes.
Joey : Doesn't work.
