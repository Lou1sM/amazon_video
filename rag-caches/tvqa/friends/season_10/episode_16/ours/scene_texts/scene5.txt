Monica : - Sure. - Thank you.
Rachel : Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night. Thank you so much.
Rachel : I love you.
Rachel : Good night.
UNK: What?!
Ross : I don't get a goodbye?
Joey : Lucky bastard.
UNK: Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me!
Monica : Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history, it could be...
Monica : ...you know, implicit. - Well, it needs to be "plicit."
Phoebe : You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.
Phoebe : - It was pretty intense. - Yeah, mine too.
Chandler : - Mine was a humdinger. - Okay!
Joey : All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.
Joey : - Did you do anything to make her mad? - No, I don't think so.
UNK: You didn't, say, borrow her Girls Gone Wild video and never return it?
UNK: Really? Now?
Ross : I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?
Ross : Not from you!
Phoebe : Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Monica : And say what? You owe me a goodbye?
Monica : - I mean, he's got more pride than that. - The hell I do!
Ross : - I don't get a goodbye? - What?
Ross : Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?
Ross : Be best friends with you? Go out with you?
Ross : Have a baby with you?
Ross : Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute! I did all those things!
Monica : - Ross... - Or maybe I'm just not giving you...
Ross : ...enough credit. I mean, it is difficult to say goodbye to five people.
Ross : Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, g...
Ross : It's physically impossible!
Rachel : You know what? After all we've been through...
Ross : ...I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us.
Ross : Have a good time in Paris.
UNK: Rach, I know this may not be the best time...
UNK: ...but Joey's going over the balcony again. Could you just come talk to him?
Monica : - I hope Ross isn't too upset. - I'm sure he's not more bummed out...
Joey : ...than I am. - Tell me about it.
Chandler : Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
Phoebe : I think I'm gonna head out.
Monica : - Where do you think you're going? - I thought I was going home to bed...
Phoebe : ...but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
UNK: We're moving, and we got a lot of packing to do.
Monica : - It'd be great if you guys could pitch in. - Joey and I can finish up the guest room.
Joey : Yeah, good idea.
Monica : Oh, no. You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Chandler : You couldn't be cool.
Monica : We're gonna start in the kitchen.
Monica : Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked 1 0 to a box.
Monica : The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Monica : - Yeah. - Good. I need you to be careful...
Monica : ...and efficient. And remember, if I'm harsh with you...
Monica : ...it is only because you're doing it wrong.
Chandler : Hey, Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Monica : - You did? How? - Well, I was cleaning out the closet...
Chandler : ...and I found some pictures of them...
Chandler : ...being used. - Oh, my God, let me see.
Joey : Who's that dirty old lady?
Chandler : Monica's grandmother.
Monica : Oh, my God. Nana liked it rough!
Rachel : - Hi. - Hey.
UNK: - What are you guys looking at? - Oh, just normal pictures...
UNK: ...of our regular family not having sex.
