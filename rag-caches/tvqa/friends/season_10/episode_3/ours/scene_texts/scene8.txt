UNK: I just found out that she tried cutting me out.
UNK: Can you think of any reason why someone would want to do that?
UNK: What is wrong with me, Chandler? Tell me.
UNK: I had a very bad car accident.
Phoebe : Chandler, thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside?
Monica : - I have nothing to say to you. - My flat is twice this size.
UNK: You know, they asked me to be one of the Spice Girls.
Phoebe : Please, Monica, in the hall?
Amanda : Oh, that accident must have been terrible.
Amanda : You look positively ghastly.
Chandler : Well, aren't you a treat.
Monica : I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why, Phoebe? Why?
Phoebe : It was right after we were living together...
Phoebe : ...and you were driving me crazy, okay?
Phoebe : You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
UNK: Well, I'm still all those things!
Phoebe : You're also so generous and kind and scrappy.
Monica : I am scrappy.
UNK: Exactly. No matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life.
UNK: Of all the people I've cut out...
Phoebe : ...you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
UNK: That's because I'm scrappy.
Phoebe : Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that you fought your way back in...
Phoebe : ...because I don't know what I would do without you.
Phoebe : I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica : Well, I guess we should go back in. I mean, you gave me another chance.
Monica : - We should do the same for Amanda. - Yeah, I guess you're right.
