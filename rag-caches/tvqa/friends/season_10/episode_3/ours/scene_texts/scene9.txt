Amanda : Can you believe it? I've never had any professionaI dance training.
Glenda : Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth and-
Ross : I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay?
Ross : Does it look like this is my first time?
UNK: Now, I want four two's, and I want them all on my back.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Wait. There's two sets of nozzles! Which one is it? Which one is it?
Ross : Oh, son of a bitch!
Phoebe : Are you kidding?
UNK: - How did we do? - I'm a twelve.
Rachel : What is the matter with us?
Joey : Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Rachel : No, I mean with us, you know? I mean, is it supposed to be this...
UNK: ...difficult?
Rachel : I don't know.
UNK: That fake British woman's a reaI bitch, but she sure can dance.
Chandler : - Hey. - Hi.
UNK: Hey, listen, can I ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up...
Rachel : ...was it weird going from friends to more than that?
UNK: Kind of. Sneaking around, having to hide from you guys-
Rachel : No, no, no. No, I mean...
UNK: ...sexually.
Joey : Yeah, was there a part of you that felt like it was...
Joey : ...really wrong?
Monica : Actually, no. No, it felt right, you know?
UNK: If felt like, "I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time. "
UNK: I can tell from your expressions that's the good news you were hoping for.
Chandler : Well, I'm gonna go continue to spread the joy.
Rachel : Just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to for us.
Joey : Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Joey : I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Rachel : - Right, totally. - Yeah. And so...
UNK: ...we'll just keep trying and trying untiI we do it.
UNK: If not, we'll just be a couple that never has sex.
UNK: That's a plan.
Joey : - I did not see this coming. - I know.
UNK: I don't know, I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this is what I wanted.
Monica : Me too.
UNK: Well, how come Monica and Chandler could do it?
Joey : I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Rachel : I bet you're right.
UNK: So...
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I love you.
Rachel : Love you too.
UNK: - All right, I'm going to bed. - Yeah, me too.
Joey : Yeah. I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Chandler : - Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in. - Go away!
UNK: I don't wanna see anybody!
Chandler : I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. Let me in.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Did you count Mississippi-Iy?
Ross : You're not tan.
Chandler : No. I just had to get a picture of this. I'll see you later.
