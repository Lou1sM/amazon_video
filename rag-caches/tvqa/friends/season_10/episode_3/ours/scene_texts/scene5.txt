Ross : The same thing happened again!
Assistant : - You got two more twos? - I'm an eight!
Rachel : Thanks for dinner.
Joey : I thought you paid.
UNK: Guess we won't be going back there.
Chandler : - So... - Yeah.
Joey : Hey, what do you say we move this onto the likes of the couch?
UNK: I say cheesy line, but okay.
Joey : - What's the matter? - I don't know. I'm sorry.
UNK: - I don't know why I did that. - Okay.
UNK: Okay. Sorry.
UNK: I'm sorry. Again, I don't know what happened. I must be nervous.
UNK: I don't get it. Chandler loved it.
UNK: I promise. I won't do it again. I really do. This is gonna be great.
UNK: Joey And Rachel : - Okay. - Okay.
Joey : Was that good for you?
UNK: No, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
UNK: Yeah, it could be RacheI asking if someone could babysit again.
Monica : - It could be Amanda. - Oh, you're right.
UNK: I was just kidding about RacheI. Babysitting's a gas.
Amanda : Hello, Monica. It's Amanda calling again.
UNK: I'm in the neighborhood, hoping I could pop by your flat.
Monica : You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffamonteezi!
UNK: Let's see. So should you get this directly...
Amanda : ...ring me back on my mobile.
UNK: Okay, don't hold thy breath.
Chandler : - Hello? Is someone on the line? - Yes. I was looking for Monica.
UNK: Hang on, she's right here.
UNK: - Someone's on the phone for you. - We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.
Chandler : I get pedicures.
Monica : Hi, Amanda.
UNK: Actually, now is not a good time.
Monica : Dinner tomorrow night?
UNK: Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.
Ross : Why? Why? Why didn't you just say no?
Monica : Well, I said no to her coming over now. I couldn't say no twice.
UNK: I got this uncontrollable need to please people.
Phoebe : Fine. Fine. You would not hold up well under torture.
UNK: - Oh, and you would? - I did.
UNK: - Rach, are you sure you wanna do this? - Absolutely.
UNK: It's just a little weird. It's you, and it's me.
UNK: - It'll just take some getting used to. - Okay.
UNK: Okay, well, how can we make it easier?
UNK: Okay. Let's work from the top down.
Rachel : - Just work the bra, Joe. - Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.
