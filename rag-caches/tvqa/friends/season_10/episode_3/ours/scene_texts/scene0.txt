UNK: Hey, Chandler, why do you think they call it foosball?
UNK: - Know what I like about you, Joe? - What?
UNK: You're curious.
Chandler : - Hey. - Hi.
UNK: I'll drop Emma off at my mom's if we're still on tonight.
UNK: - Oh, you bet. Yeah. - Okay.
UNK: - Say, "Bye. " - Bye.
UNK: - Bye. - Bye.
UNK: - So you and RacheI tonight, huh? - Yeah.
Joey : Yeah, it's actually our first officiaI date.
Chandler : Wow, so tonight may be the night. You nervous?
Joey : No. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Chandler : What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing?
UNK: It's okay.
Chandler : How can you be so confident?
UNK: Well, I know exactly what I'm gonna do.
Chandler : - Really? Like, you have a routine? - No. See, each woman is different.
Joey : You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
Chandler : - Really? - No, I do six things.
UNK: First, I look deep into her eyes, then I kiss her.
Joey : Next, I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Chandler : You mean like this?
Joey : No, not like that. No, no. No, like this :
Chandler : I see what you mean. That's quite nice.
Joey : - More foosball? - And beer.
Chandler : - Hey. - Hey.
Monica : Hey, sweetie.
Chandler : Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.
Chandler : No, no. Stop staring at your sister's legs.
Ross : I'm sorry, it's just- How'd you get so tan?
UNK: She went to one of those spray-on tan places.
UNK: That was supposed to be a secret.
UNK: Did I say spray-on tan places?
UNK: I meant surf contest.
UNK: Which she won.
Ross : You got a spray-on tan?
Monica : Chandler gets pedicures!
UNK: What? You do? Like, with the toe separators?
Ross : Why? Why?
Ross : I can't believe that's sprayed on.
Ross : I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one.
UNK: Sure, then you should get a miniskirt so you can really show it off.
UNK: So do you get colors or just French tips?
Monica : - Here. Here's their card. - Thanks.
Ross : Hey, I know where this place is.
Ross : It used to be an X-rated video-
UNK: Florist.
Chandler : - Hey. - Hey, Pheebs.
Phoebe : You won't believe who moved back to town.
Monica : I know. Amanda.
Monica : - She called me too. She's the worst. - Who's Amanda?
UNK: She's this girI who lived in the building before you did.
Monica : Then she moved to England and picked up this fake British accent.
UNK: On the machine, this is her message :
UNK: "Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling. "
Chandler : Are you trying to do a British accent?
Monica : Chandler gets pedicures.
Chandler : Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Phoebe : Know what Amanda said when she called me?
Phoebe : "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your mobile. "
UNK: If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile, then don't call me on my mobile.
UNK: And she always brags about all the famous people she's met.
Phoebe : Oh, I know!
UNK: "I slept with Billy JoeI."
Phoebe : All right, who hasn't?
Monica : What are we gonna do? I don't wanna see her.
Phoebe : Let's just cut her out.
Chandler : - What? - Cut her out of our lives.
Phoebe : Just ignore her calls and dodge her till she gets the point.
UNK: Well, I guess we could try that. But it seems so harsh.
Monica : - Have you ever done that? - No. Had it done to me, though.
Chandler : Feels good.
