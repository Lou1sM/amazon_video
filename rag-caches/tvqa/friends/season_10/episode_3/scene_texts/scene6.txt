UNK: Joey And Rachel : - Okay. - Okay.
UNK: - Is this thing welded shut? - Okay.
UNK: - You want a little help? - No.
UNK: Joey And Rachel : - Okay. - I can handle it. Okay?
UNK: - I've been opening these since I was 9. - Nine?
UNK: - What kind of 9-year-old girI wears a bra? - No, no. I was 9.
UNK: See, she was 16. Okay? Yeah.
UNK: My parents had- I can't talk and work at the same time!
Joey : All right, turn around. I gotta get a look at this thing.
UNK: Sorry.
Rachel : Well, this is romantic.
UNK: I'm sorry. This has never happened to me before.
Joey : I'm an expert at taking off bras. I could do it with one hand.
UNK: I could do it with my eyes closed. Once I just looked at one...
Joey : ...and it popped open.
Joey : - I blame your bra. - It's a standard-issue bra clasp.
Joey : Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right. You threw me off with all your slapping.
UNK: Okay, look, I'm really sorry about that, Joey.
UNK: But do you think maybe, on some leveI, you don't want to take off my bra?
UNK: No, I don't have another leveI.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Oh, dear God.
UNK: Hold on. There's something different.
Ross : I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Chandler : Was that place the sun?
Ross : Oh, and it gets worse.
Chandler : Oh, my God, you can do a duet of "Ebony and Ivory" all by yourself.
Monica : How could you mess this up? It's so easy.
UNK: You go in the booth, count to five and turn around.
Ross : - How do you count to five? - One, two, three-
UNK: Damn it!
Joey : I know!
Rachel : What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Chandler : How was your date with Joey?
Rachel : Well, it was good, untiI we got back to our apartment.
Rachel : And then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg...
Rachel : ...and I kept slapping it away.
Chandler : You didn't like that?
UNK: Well, it wasn't just me, all right? He freaked out too.
Rachel : He couldn't even undo my bra.
Monica : Really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Rachel : I do not know what's wrong with us.
UNK: We've kissed before and that's been great.
Rachel : But this time it was leading somewhere...
Rachel : ...and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Monica : You guys have been friends forever.
UNK: The first time you kissed Ross was weird.
Monica : You couldn't stop laughing. You got through that.
UNK: Okay. That's true. That's true, we can do this.
Rachel : You're right. We can do this. We'll just power through.
Joey : Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
Rachel : No need, problem solved. We are powering through.
Monica : Chandler, stop. It's not going to pop open.
Chandler : You don't know.
UNK: - Hi, Phoebe. - Hey.
Monica : - Is Amanda here yet? - No.
UNK: I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting her out" plan, but I have a new plan.
