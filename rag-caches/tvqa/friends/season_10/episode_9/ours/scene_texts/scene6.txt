UNK: Because.
Monica : We may not be who she thinks we are...
UNK: ...but no one will ever love that baby more than us.
Monica : - I know. - I mean, who knows...
Monica : ...how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby?
Monica : What if no one ever picks us?
Chandler : Oh, honey...
UNK: Please?
Monica : Please. We are so close.
Chandler : Monica, I want a baby too.
Chandler : But this woman is giving away her child.
Chandler : She deserves to know who it's going to.
UNK: Okay. You're right.
Chandler : So we'll tell the truth.
UNK: And who knows, you know? Maybe she'll like us for us.
Chandler : Maybe she will.
Monica : Why couldn't I have been a reverend?
Chandler : You're Jewish.
UNK: Technicality!
Waiter : Garden salad for the lady.
Joey : Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
Waiter : Seafood platter for the gentleman, and extra fries.
UNK: Enjoy.
Sarah : Those fries look delicious.
Joey : I didn't know you liked French fries.
Joey : Help yourself. What's mine is yours.
Sarah : Wow, are those stuffed clams?
Joey : Yes, they are my stuffed clams.
Joey : How about those fries, though, huh?
Sarah : - They are delicious. - Yeah.
UNK: You are beautifuI, you know that?
Sarah : That is so sweet.
UNK: Okay, then.
Joey : Now look what you did!
Sarah : What? What is the matter with you?
Joey : I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
UNK: But you said, "What's mine is yours. "
Joey : Well, I didn't mean it!
UNK: Fine. Sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deaI.
UNK: No, I'm sorry. I...
Joey : I'm overreacting, okay? It's just, when it comes to food, I...
Joey : ...have certain rules...
Joey : ...okay? I mean...
UNK: ...there are things you do, and, you know, things that you don't do.
Girl : Wow, this place looks great.
Ross : Oh, you are gonna love it. And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
Girl : - Me too. - Here.
Ross : So this was fun.
Joey : I really am sorry about, you know, before.
UNK: And I want to make sure you know I really do like you.
UNK: Sure, just not as much as clams.
Joey : Well, stuffed clams...
Waiter : Chocolate torte for the lady.
Waiter : Cheesecake for the gentleman.
Joey : Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
UNK: Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.
UNK: Coulis is not a monkey?
UNK: When I read the description I thought it came with a little raspberry monkey.
Monica : - Oh, my God. - I'll just have what she's having instead.
Waiter : Oh, I'm sorry, sir. That was our last piece.
UNK: I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
Rachel : Oh, no.
Sarah : This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
Joey : Yeah, sure. No problem.
Sarah : What are you doing? I thought you don't share food?
Joey : Sure I do.
UNK: Coulis?
Sarah : No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert.
UNK: This is a two-way street.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Really.
Sarah : Now this all better be here when I come back.
UNK: Yeah, of course. I can controI myself.
Joey : Stop staring at me!
Joey : Just a tiny little...
Joey : I'm not even sorry.
Chandler : - Hi. - Hey.
UNK: Agency Guy : So these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption.
UNK: Agency Guy : There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain as we go through.
