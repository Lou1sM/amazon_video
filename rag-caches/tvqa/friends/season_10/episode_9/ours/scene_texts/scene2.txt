Rachel : Now throw it away.
UNK: Come on! This looks good.
Rachel : Ross, please trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.
Rachel : Now I don't know who's running for president or who that NATO guy is...
Rachel : ...but I do know that you have to get far away from that hat.
UNK: Damn it. God...
Ross : I have this date tomorrow night, and I have to look cooI.
UNK: - Well, who's the girI? - Her name's Joan.
UNK: She's in fashion. She works for Hugo Boss.
UNK: Hugo Boss? I thought you said she was in fashion.
UNK: At the Ralph Lauren offices, that would've killed.
UNK: If you want fashion help, RacheI and I are going shopping tomorrow.
UNK: - You're welcome to come with us. - Really? That would be great.
Ross : I mean, I have to do something.
UNK: She kind of teased me about how I dress.
Joey : I can see why. Nice shirt.
Ross : You're wearing the same shirt.
Joey : Stupid Gap on every corner!
UNK: Make yourselves comfortable, and I'll be back with Erica.
UNK: Okay, thank you.
Monica : Well, this is it.
UNK: - Are you okay? - Yeah, it's just weird, you know?
UNK: It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
Chandler : You're gonna be great.
Chandler : You're gonna be great.
Monica : Well, obviously.
UNK: Agency Guy : Monica? Chandler? I'd like you to meet Erica.
Chandler : - Hi. - Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Chandler : - Hi. - Thank you for agreeing to see us.
Chandler : - Hi. - I'll let you get acquainted.
Phoebe : - Okay. - So it's Monica and Chandler?
Erica : I only know you as "File CRW33815-D."
Chandler : That's what our friends call us.
Erica : Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's...
Erica : ...kind of intimidating.
Monica : I don't know about that.
UNK: Are you kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.
Erica : But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
Chandler : - I don't think that's exactly- - Let her finish, doctor.
Ross : - Hey. - Hey.
Phoebe : My friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Chandler : - Yeah. - Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?
UNK: No.
Phoebe : What are you talking about? Sarah's great.
UNK: Oh, really? You want to know what your "great" friend did?
UNK: We're out to dinner, okay?
Joey : We were getting along, having a really nice time.
UNK: I was thinking she was really cooI.
Joey : And then, out of nowhere...
UNK: That's it?
UNK: That's why you won't go out with her again?
UNK: So she took some fries. Big deaI.
UNK: Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.
UNK: It's about what the fries represent.
Phoebe : - What? - All food!
UNK: Well, I'm sorry.
UNK: I can't believe I set you up with such a monster!
UNK: Hey, look, I take a girI out...
Joey : ...she can order whatever she wants. The more the better, all right?
UNK: Just don't order a garden salad and then eat my food!
UNK: That's a good way to lose some fingers.
UNK: - Thank God you're here. Listen to this. - What?
Phoebe : Joey and my friend are out last night, having dinner, and she reaches over...
Phoebe : - ... and takes a few of his fries- - Oh, no!
UNK: What?
Phoebe : You know about the plate thing?
UNK: Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Joey doesn't share food.
Rachel : I mean, just last week we were having breakfast...
UNK: ...and he had a couple grapes on his plate.
UNK: - You wouldn't let her have a grape? - No, not me.
