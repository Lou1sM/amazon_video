UNK: Emma.
Joey : Joey doesn't share food!
UNK: Well, I still think that is a stupid reason not to call someone again.
UNK: You are calling her, okay?
UNK: And if you need to, then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.
Joey : I like that.
Joey : A sharing buffer. Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, I'll order some extra fries. Maybe a plate of onion rings.
Phoebe : Yeah. Yeah.
UNK: And a shrimp cocktaiI.
Joey : And some Buffalo wings.
UNK: Maybe... Maybe an individuaI pizza, huh?
Joey : And some mozzarella sticks.
Joey : What were we talking about?
UNK: Wow, this place is awesome. Everyone is so mean.
UNK: So fun.
Ross : We should just go. I'm not gonna find anything here.
Ross : This stuff is ridiculous.
UNK: Oh, this place is great!
UNK: Okay, you guys have fun. I'm gonna go talk to people in this voice.
UNK: Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this. Nothing silver.
Joey : - Why? - Okay, nothing with hair.
Ross : And nothing with padlocks on it!
UNK: Ross, look. Look, I know that some of this stuff is out there.
Rachel : But I mean, come on, look at this. Look at this sweater.
UNK: I mean, this is just beautifuI.
Ross : Wow, this is really soft.
Ross : Three hundred and fifty dollars?

UNK: Hey, check this out. It's totally you.
Phoebe : - Wow. - Yeah.
UNK: Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: "Boys will be boys"?
Phoebe : - What? They will be! - All right.
UNK: - That's it, I'm getting out of here. - No, Ross, wait, come on.
UNK: There's other stuff here. There's some nice shirts, these nice pants.
Ross : Actually, these might look pretty good on me.
Rachel : Yes, they will. You know what you should do? Go take a walk.
UNK: All right? I know your size, and I'll pick out some really good stuff for you.
Chandler : - Really? - Yes.
Rachel : I know what looks sexy on guys.
Rachel : Just wear what I suggest, and she is gonna go nuts for you.
UNK: So you're saying...
Ross : ...if I wear these pants, I might be getting into hers?
Rachel : Why do men keep talking to me like this?
UNK: So the fact that I'm a doctor and my wife's a reverend...
