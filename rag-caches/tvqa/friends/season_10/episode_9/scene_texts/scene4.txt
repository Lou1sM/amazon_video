UNK: ...that's important to you?
Erica : Yeah. I read some great applications...
UNK: ...but I thought, "Who better than a minister to raise a child?"
UNK: Amen.
Chandler : Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.
Chandler : Good hands.
Monica : Healing hands.
Erica : Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible say anything about adoption?
UNK: It says, "Do it. "
UNK: "And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.
UNK: And it was good. "
Phoebe : - Wow. - Yeah, wow.
Erica : I was wondering- You both have such serious jobs.
Erica : Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Monica : - My flock? - People in your church.
UNK: Oh, my flock.
UNK: Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.
Monica : Yeah. My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.
Monica : Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
UNK: But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.
UNK: Not for me it doesn't.
UNK: So how's everything going in here?
UNK: We're great. I think I may have asked all my questions.
UNK: Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
Chandler : Yeah, actually. So you read a file that you liked...
UNK: ...and then you gave the agency the seriaI number and they contacted us?
UNK: Yes. Our system ensures totaI anonymity.
UNK: - We're very proud of it. - You should be.
UNK: You're really on top of stuff.
UNK: Well then, if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Erica : I actually...
UNK: - I don't think we have to. - We don't?
Erica : Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you...
Erica : ...but I just thought we should meet face to face.
Erica : I've made my decision.
Erica : I choose them.
Monica : Oh, my God, this is great.
UNK: This is so great. Did you hear that?
Chandler : Yeah, I did.
UNK: Hey.
Monica : Thank you. Thank you so much.
Monica : You are so going to heaven!
Rachel : - We got some really great stuff. - Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got.
UNK: Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me?
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Rachel : Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags by mistake.
UNK: And one of mine is missing.
Phoebe : Ross probably has it. You'll get it from him later.
Ross : So, what do you think?
Joey : I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, RacheI picked it out for me.
Ross : She told me to trust her, and you know what? I'm glad I did.
Ross : I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Joey : Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Ross : I see.
UNK: Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Joey : Looks like someone is the ladies!
Ross : You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.
Ross : Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date.
UNK: See? All eyes on me!
Chandler : - We are not signing those papers. - Why not?
Chandler : It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica : God works in mysterious ways.
UNK: You have got to stop.
Monica : But she liked us.
Chandler : She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
