UNK: Hey, Emma, you better appreciate this while it lasts...
UNK: ...because when you get older, you're not gonna be able to just sit around all day.
UNK: - So true. - Yeah.
Ross : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: We're here to say goodbye. We're off to Ohio.
Phoebe : Oh, right, your adoption interview.
UNK: Yep. We'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
UNK: I can't believe it. When you come back, you'll have a baby. That is so weird.
Chandler : And so incorrect.
UNK: She's only a couple months pregnant.
Monica : She liked our application but might not like us.
Ross : Come on, she's gonna love you guys.
UNK: Thank you. But we're trying not to get our hopes up.
Monica : A lot could still get in our way.
UNK: She could decide against adoption, like another couple better.
UNK: What are you gonna name it?
UNK: I could develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
UNK: But just think, okay? What if everything goes right?
Joey : What if this woman does pick you guys?
Monica : Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!
Chandler : So we're standing firm on "not getting our hopes up"?
UNK: No. I know things could still go wrong, but if they don't...
Monica : ...if this works out, we're gonna have a baby. A baby!
Chandler : - Yes. But- - Oh, my God. It's gonna work!
Monica : We're gonna make it work!
UNK: I'm gonna be a mommy, and you're gonna be a daddy!
Monica : All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna go get me a baby!
Chandler : Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!
Rachel : Hey, who's Phoebe with?
UNK: Mike.
UNK: No, Joey. Who is Phoebe with at the door?
UNK: I wanna say, "Someone I'm gonna have sex with. "
Ross : - Hey. - Hey.
Joey : - So who's your friend? - Oh, that's Sarah.
Phoebe : No. Don't you get any ideas.
Phoebe : I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends.
Joey : - Why? Why? - Because you'll date her once...
UNK: ...sleep with her, then forget she exists.
UNK: Name one friend of yours I did that with.
Phoebe : - Mandy. - Mandy, huh?
UNK: Really hot blond, big boobs?
Monica : - No. - Might be why I don't remember, huh?
Rachel : Do you think I'm someone else?
UNK: Look, I may not have treated your friends well in the past.
Joey : But I have grown up a lot. Really. Honest. Rach?
UNK: Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.
UNK: I mean, when Joey and I were together...
UNK: ...he was wonderfuI. He was thoughtfuI and mature.
Rachel : And for the one week that we went out...
Rachel : ...he didn't sleep with anybody else.
UNK: Growth.
Phoebe : - Fine, I'll give you her number. - Okay. Thank you.
Joey : And I promise you I will not forget this one.
Phoebe : - Mandy. - Sarah!
