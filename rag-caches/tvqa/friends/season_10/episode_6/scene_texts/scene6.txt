Chandler : He really is a chameleon.
Phoebe : Well, Gladys, say hello to your new home.
Phoebe : - Oh, my. - Wow.
UNK: Oh, she is so nice and big.
Rachel : Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys, oh, so proudly?
Monica : - I haven't really settled on a spot yet. - How about right above the TV?
Rachel : That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door.
Phoebe : Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid of that French poster.
Monica : - I like that poster. - Really?
Phoebe : It doesn't have anything coming out of it.
UNK: Or maybe there's someplace for her in your bedroom?
Rachel : - There's nothing above your bed. - Are you still here?
UNK: Stupid NobeI Prize winner.
Ross : Oh, hi. Hello.
Ross : Have you come to ask me some more paleontology-related questions?
Ross : Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Ann-Margret's pant size?
Benjamin : I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings...
Benjamin : ...for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
Ross : No. Stop.
UNK: Anyway, I decided to offer you the grant.
Phoebe : - Really? - There is just one small stipulation.
Ross : - I have to break up with Charlie? - Hey, you got one right.
Ross : - You're crazy. - Crazy or romantic?
UNK: Crazy.
Ross : - Or? - Get out!
Charlie : Oh, my God.
Ross : - What? - Joey, what is this thing doing here?
UNK: I got her from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Rachel : - Joey, we're not keeping this. - But it's an originaI Buffay.
UNK: All right, fine. You can keep it.
Rachel : As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Joey : Hey, what? What?
Rachel : Well, legend has it, Joey, that she comes alive when you're asleep.
Rachel : She climbs out of the frame...
Rachel : ...and then drags her half-a-body across the floor...
UNK: ...just looking for legs to steaI.
Rachel : And then with her one good hand...
UNK: ...she slowly reaches up...
Rachel : ...and turns your doorknob.
Joey : Get that legless witch out of here!
Monica : - Hey, I sold that to Joey. - Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.
Rachel : - Two can play at this game. - Too late. You can't give it back.
UNK: - Oh, yes, I can. - No, you can't, she's yours.
Phoebe : - She's yours. - She's yours.
Phoebe : - She's yours. - Hey.
