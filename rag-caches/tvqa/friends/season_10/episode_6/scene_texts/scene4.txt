UNK: Oh, that's so sweet.
Joey : - What's up? - Bad news.
Chandler : I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Chandler : I'm sorry, man.
UNK: - But you watched the tape? - Yeah, I liked it.
UNK: But my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches.
Joey : - You didn't watch the tape. - What? Of course I did.
Joey : Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
UNK: - I'm not Iying to you. I watched it. - You lied again.
Chandler : - I watched it. - Keep going, Pinocchio.
Monica : - I did. - No, you didn't.
Chandler : I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
Rachel : - Did you watch the tape? - No.
UNK: Hi. Look, I realize only one of us can get this grant.
UNK: And I just wanted to wish both of you the best of luck.
UNK: Are you crossing your fingers?
UNK: What, this? No. This- That's just the result of a childhood injury.
UNK: I'm cured!
UNK: Good morning, everybody.
UNK: If you go ahead and take your seats we can get started.
UNK: Actually, Dr. Hobart, can I have a word with you?
UNK: And you are?
Scene : - Ross. - I know. I'm kidding.
UNK: Listen, I just want to say, last night-
UNK: Dinner was a little awkward.
UNK: - I just wanna make sure we're okay. - Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
UNK: - You didn't tell Charlie what I said, did you? - Oh, no. Of course not.
UNK: Well, thank you. I want you to know, I respect your decision not to give her up.
UNK: It was the biggest mistake I ever made in my whole life.
UNK: Well, that and tattooing her name on my shoulder...
UNK: ...last night stupidly.
UNK: Seriously?
UNK: My NobeI Prize was not for moving on.
UNK: - So no hard feelings? - None at all. Good luck today.
Phoebe : - Thank you. - Okay.
UNK: All right. The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists.
UNK: The ultimate decision will be based on the answers you give to the questions I ask.
UNK: We're gonna go ahead and start with Dr. Li.
Benjamin : You claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
Benjamin : How do you propose to correct this problem?
UNK: Dr. Li : Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteologicaI evidence.
UNK: Dr. Li : - I plan to begin there. - Interesting.
Ross : I guess.
UNK: Dr. Biely, your proposaI includes some fieldwork. Where might that take place?
UNK: Dr. Biely : Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Benjamin : Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
Rachel : What? I-
Benjamin : Care to venture a guess?
Ross : - May 12? - That's not even kind of close.
Benjamin : Dr. Li, how many graduate students will you need?
UNK: Dr. Li : - Half a dozen. - I see. And Dr. Biely?
UNK: Dr. Biely : Three for excavation, and two for analysis.
Benjamin : Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit...
Benjamin : ...was later covered by a popular British Invasion band?
UNK: What? I need six graduate students.
Benjamin : No, I'm sorry. We were looking for "Baby It's You. "
UNK: "Baby It's You. "
UNK: What? Wait just a minute.
Ross : None of my questions have anything to do with paleontology.
Benjamin : You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.
UNK: Spell "Boscodictiasaur. "
Benjamin : I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur. "
Benjamin : Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
UNK: - Okay. B-O- - No, it starts with a silent M.
Ross : Oh, come on!
Chandler : I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar.
Rachel : But you are a liar.
Chandler : What did I just say?
Monica : - Are you still here? - Yes.
UNK: And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted. When I tell somebody I did something-
UNK: Okay, hold on, let me just stop you right there, okay? First, you lied. Right?
UNK: Then you lied about Iying, okay?
UNK: Then you lied about Iying about Iying, okay?
UNK: So before you lie about Iying about Iying about Iying about Iying...
UNK: Stop Iying.
Chandler : Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Joey : You wanna know why? You wanna know why?
Rachel : Well, this is going well.
Joey : Here's how I know you didn't watch.
Joey : If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you'd have some comments.
UNK: All right, remember, I got paid a lot of money for this...
Joey : ...and it only aired in Japan.
UNK: Ichiban.
UNK: Ichiban, lipstick for men.
