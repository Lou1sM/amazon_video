Chandler : I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Charlie : Oh, my God.
UNK: Excellent.
Joey : Now what do you say?
Chandler : Lying is wrong.
Joey : And? And?
UNK: I'm a pretty little girI.
Phoebe : I knew it.
Ross : Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
UNK: - He is a character. - No, no, no.
UNK: Charles Nelson Reilly is a character.
Joey : - Who? - Charles Nelson Reilly.
UNK: The Ghost and Mrs. Muir? Match Game?
UNK: Were you never sick as a child?
UNK: - Whatever. Did you get the grant? - No. And you wanna know why?
Ross : Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Ross : - What? - Yeah.
UNK: He refused me because I wouldn't give you up.
Charlie : Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me.
UNK: - And besides, he's a very ethicaI man. - Really?
UNK: Is it ethicaI to ask someone in a grant review :
UNK: "Who was the voice of Underdog?"
Charlie : I'm sure he was just joking.
Ross : If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him.
Ross : I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontologicaI question.
Charlie : - Seriously? - Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one :
UNK: "How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"
Charlie : Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O-
Monica : Damn it.
Benjamin : Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are you doing here?
Ross : I want you to tell her everything.
UNK: About the deaI you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you-
Ross : Wally Cox. That's the voice of Underdog.
Benjamin : Like I tried to tell you in the interview...
Benjamin : ...this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
Ross : No, don't do that. I want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth.
UNK: Benji?
UNK: All right. It's true. I behaved horribly, but it's only because I still love you.
Benjamin : And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Ross : Too little, too late, Benji.
Charlie : - I can't believe this. - I never should've broken up with you.
Benjamin : I think about you all the time. Do you ever still think about me?
UNK: No.
Phoebe : - Yes. - What?
Charlie : I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so...
UNK: ...romantic.
UNK: Or?
Benjamin : I know I may be way out of bounds here...
Benjamin : ...but is there any chance you would take me back?
UNK: Maybe.
Ross : Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Charlie : Oh, God. I am so sorry, but-
UNK: I mean, there's so much history between us, you know?
Benjamin : I'm sorry too.
Benjamin : - I love you. - I love you too.
Ross : Okay, that's it, we are seeing other people.
UNK: Gladys?
UNK: For the third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
Joey : - You're mean! - Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.
