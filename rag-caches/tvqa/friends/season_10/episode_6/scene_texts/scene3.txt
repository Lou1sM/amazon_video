Ross : I'm okay.
UNK: I'm sorry. Ross Geller, Benjamin Hobart.
Ross : It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long...
Ross : ...I've been an admirer of your work. I mean, that NobeI Prize.
Ross : I mean, I have to tell you that you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
Benjamin : Well, likewise.
UNK: Not likewise. I'd never heard of you untiI this morning.
Benjamin : But it's nice to be nice.
Charlie : - Shall we? - Yeah. Thank you.
Benjamin : I can't believe that you chose this restaurant.
Benjamin : - Do you remember the night? - Oh, my God. I completely forgot.
Charlie : Oh, my God, I can't believe they let us back in this place.
Chandler : You weren't there.
UNK: No, but, you know, it's just a funny image.
Ross : You know, the two of you in this restaurant with the...
Charlie : Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposaI while I go to the ladies' room.
Benjamin : So tell me about it.
UNK: Okay. Well, I would like to do a dig in the Painted Desert.
UNK: There are still severaI areas that haven't been fully excavated.
Benjamin : - Break up with Charlie. - What?
UNK: What?
Ross : Did you just say, "Break up with Charlie"?
UNK: Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it. And no, I didn't not say it.
Ross : - Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? - Listen, I'm sorry.
Benjamin : I just haven't seen her for so long, all these feelings are rushing back.
Benjamin : I'm starting to realize how much I've missed her.
Benjamin : And I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Ross : - Are you serious? - If you say, yes, then I'm serious.
Benjamin : If you say, no, then I'm joking.
Rachel : - No. - Joking it is.
Phoebe : - Hi, sorry I'm late. - Hey, how'd it go with Mike?
Monica : - Is he gonna let you keep the painting? - No, he really hates it.
Phoebe : But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair.
UNK: So you gotta pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours.
Monica : Wow, what's the bad news?
Monica : - Who's Gladys? - Oh, she's that work of art I made.
Phoebe : You know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
Rachel : And Monica gets to keep her?
Rachel : In her house? I am so jealous.
Phoebe : I didn't know you wanted her too.
Rachel : Well, I mean, sure, of course.
Rachel : But you already gave that to Monica, so...
Monica : - You know, I would give her up for you. - No, I couldn't let you do that.
UNK: - No, but I want to. - But I don't want you to.
Monica : - But I insist. - But I insist harder.
Phoebe : Girls. Girls. Stop. Okay, we'll flip a coin.
UNK: Heads, she's RacheI's. Tails, she's Monica's.
Phoebe : - Tails. Monica, she's yours. - No, that landed in your food.
UNK: No, no, that's okay. You won fair and square. I'm so sad.
UNK: Then the little red squirreI took all of his acorns...
UNK: ...and put them in his little satcheI and set off for-
UNK: Okay. Someone's getting a little fussy. I think it's time for bed.
UNK: Where's the little red squirreI going?
Chandler : Hey, Joe?
