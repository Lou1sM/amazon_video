Joey : What do you mean? I can do anything. I'm a chameleon.
Joey : I'm old.
Joey : I'm tired.
UNK: Oh, I am hot. I'm cold. Come on, what can't I do?
Chandler : First of all, bravo.
UNK: But I don't think you're right for this. The part's a stuffy college professor.
UNK: I can do that. Hello, I'm your professor.

Ross : So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant?
