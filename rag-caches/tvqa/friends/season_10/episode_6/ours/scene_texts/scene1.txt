Ross : Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.
UNK: No. No, we ended on great terms.
Charlie : If anything, I think this could help you. You know what?
Charlie : Why don't we all go out to dinner, and I can introduce you.
Ross : - If you think it'd help. - Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.
Ross : Now, is there anything I could do to butter him up?
Ross : Anything he really likes?
Charlie : He does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Ross : We'll see how dinner goes.
