Phoebe : - Thank you so much for this. - You like it?
Phoebe : Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.
Phoebe : When's the dirty stuff starting?
Chandler : - What? - The strippers and the guys dancing...
Phoebe : ...and, you know, pee-pees flying about.
Rachel : Pheebs, I... There isn't gonna be any "flying about."
UNK: We thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
UNK: Oh, okay.
Phoebe : I see what you're doing. That's fine. This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.
UNK: Raunchy.
Rachel : Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Phoebe : Really? So this is...?
UNK: This is my big sendoff into married life?
Phoebe : Rachel, this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.
UNK: I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.
Phoebe : Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
UNK: No.
UNK: - Phoebe, of course there's more. - Okay.
UNK: I mean, let me just go talk to Monica...
Rachel : ...and get an ETA on the pee-pees.
