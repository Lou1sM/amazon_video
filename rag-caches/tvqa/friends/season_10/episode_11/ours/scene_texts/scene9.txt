Joey : Oh, yeah.
Roy : Did someone call for the long arm of the law?
Roy : I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon.
Roy : I hope you're familiar with this state's penal code.
UNK: Okay, okay. Enough teasing.
Roy : Now for some pleasing.
Roy : She cringed.
UNK: This is how I look when I'm turned-on.
Roy : You were talking about me before.
UNK: Look, I don't need this. I'm out of here. Where's my hat?
Roy : Look, I've been in this business for a long time.
UNK: Shocking.
UNK: Now, if you'll just pay me my $300, I'll be on my way.
UNK: - $300? Are you kidding? - That's okay. Let me get my checkbook.
Phoebe : You're not gonna pay him. He didn't do anything.
Roy : Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken.
UNK: I climbed, I don't know, like, a billion stairs.
UNK: And it's not like I can take them two at a time.
Phoebe : I don't care. We're not paying you $300 for this.
Roy : It's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate...
Roy : ...the male form in all its glory.
UNK: Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't wanna watch a middle-aged guy...
Phoebe : ...dance around in what I can only assume is a child's Halloween costume.
Roy : I may have borrowed this from my nephew...
Roy : ...but let me assure you, what's underneath is all man.
UNK: I'm sorry, did you say "all man" or "old man"?
Roy : You're mean.
UNK: - Look, officer... Sir? - Damn it.
Roy : Big surprise. The hunk of beef has feelings.
UNK: Applause.
UNK: Okay, Henrietta, you picked "Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."
Joey : My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes.
Donny : Joey, describe these things associated with the United States Congress.
