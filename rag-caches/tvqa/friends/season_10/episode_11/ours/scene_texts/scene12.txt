Roy : What's the matter? You never saw a 50-year-old stripper cry before?
Phoebe : You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Roy : No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?
Roy : I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago.
UNK: Half the time, it just pops off by itself.
UNK: Maybe now is a good time for cake and presents.
Roy : What am I gonna do? I mean...
UNK: ...this has been my life for 32 years.
Roy : Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
UNK: No, there's got to be something else that you can do.
Rachel : I mean, what skills do you have?
Ross : I don't know.
Roy : I can make my pecs dance.
Roy : I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks.
Roy : I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Rachel : So maybe something in an office.
UNK: Or you could... You could teach stripping.
Phoebe : You know, share your gift. Pass the torch.
Roy : You know, actually, that's not a bad idea.
UNK: I could do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
Phoebe : There you go. Okay. You think you're gonna be okay?
Ross : - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.
Roy : This is so weird.
Roy : You never know when it's gonna be your last dance.
Roy : And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Roy : Finish it.
Chandler : - What? - Your last dance. Do it for us.
Ross : - Really? - Really?
Phoebe : Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Roy : Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Oh, this is so hot!
UNK: Oh, no, don't stop.
Monica : Have to.
UNK: I am so sorry that you have to do this with me.
UNK: Listen, I know this won't put your kid through college...
UNK: ...but would you like a Days of our Lives mug?
UNK: We're back in five, four, three, two...
UNK: Applause.
UNK: Welcome to the Winner's Circle. Joey, Gene, you guys ready?
Phoebe : - Yeah. - Sure.
UNK: Okay. Give me 60 seconds on the clock, please.
Donny : Ready? Go.
Gene : Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch.
Joey : I don't know. Types of trees...?
Joey : Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't know any Spanish words.
Gene : A match. A candle.
UNK: Things that go : when you put them out.
