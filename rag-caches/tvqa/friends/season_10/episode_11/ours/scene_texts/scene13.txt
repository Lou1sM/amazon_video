Gene : - Supermodels. - Where?
UNK: I can't believe you're so upset.
UNK: What do you mean? You kissed Rachel.
UNK: Ross, she was so drunk she didn't even remember it the next day.
UNK: Plus, I should tell you, it did not last long.
UNK: Hey!
Chandler : I'm in college, and I'm in a band.
Phoebe : Yeah, okay.
UNK: And now I've killed one.
Ross : Hey. Where's Rachel?
Monica : She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
UNK: Sounds like your elegant tea party went off just as planned.
Ross : Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Monica : What? When was this?
UNK: Last week. We had some wine and...
UNK: You don't know I'm kidding.
UNK: 1 987.
Ross : The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Monica : - Oh, my God. That's wild. - But it was, like, a million years ago.
Chandler : - It doesn't matter. - It matters to me.
Joey : - Why? - Because the night you kissed Rachel...
Ross : ...was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler : - You kissed her that night too? - Two guys in one night?
UNK: Oh, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Chandler : - Seriously, where did this happen? - Okay...
Ross : ...after you told me she was passed out in our room...
Ross : ...I went in there to make sure she was all right.
Ross : She was lying on my bed, all buried in people's coats.
Ross : I went to kiss her on the forehead...
Ross : ...but it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips.
Ross : I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back.
Ross : It was only for a second, but it was amazing.
UNK: And now I find out that you kissed her first.
Chandler : - Wait, what bed did you say she was on? - Mine.
UNK: - I'm sure I put her on my bed. - No, she was definitely on my bed.
Chandler : Why would I kiss a girl and then put her on your bed?
Ross : Well, then who was on my bed?
Ross : No! No!
UNK: Yes!
Ross : - You were under the pile of coats? - I was the pile of coats!
Ross : Oh, my God!
Monica : You were my midnight mystery kisser?!
Ross : You were my first kiss with Rachel?!
Monica : You were my first kiss ever?!
Chandler : What did I marry into?!
UNK: Orap!
