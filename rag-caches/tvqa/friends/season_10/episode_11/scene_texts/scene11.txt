Donny : And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: Pass.
UNK: Nope. You must be thinking of someone else.
UNK: I was never in a band.
Ross : You made out with Missy Goldberg?
Ross : How could you do that after you promised me?
Chandler : Excuse me.
Chandler : That didn't make us sound gay at all.
Ross : - You broke the pact. - Ross, that was 1 6 years ago.
Ross : That doesn't matter. We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Chandler : I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.
Chandler : If we're really gonna do this, it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Ross : - I didn't. - Oh, really?
Ross : - No. - Oh, really?
Ross : - No. - Adrienne Turner.
UNK: Yes?
UNK: Chandler And Ross : - Hey, Adrienne. - Hey, Adrienne. Hey.
Ross : I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Chandler : Oh, please. And you knew how much I liked her.
Ross : I don't know what you're talking about.
UNK: Really? Remember that party freshman year?
UNK: Present Chandler's Voice : A week before Christmas vacation? I do.
UNK: Present Chandler's Voice : You had some visitors.
Monica : I can't believe we're at a real college party.
Monica : I have to pee so bad.
Rachel : This is so awesome.
UNK: Oollege guys are so cute.
Monica : - Hey, you've got a boyfriend. - I know.
UNK: But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him.
UNK: Hey, look, there's Chandler.
Monica : That stupid friend of Ross' who said I was fat.
UNK: - I've already lost four pounds. - You can so totally tell.
Chandler : I know!
Rachel : Well, let's see, maybe he knows where Ross is.
Rachel : Hey, how's it going?
Chandler : - Aren't you...? - Yeah, Rachel.
UNK: And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving.
UNK: Right. So how you doing?
UNK: Bitchen.
Chandler : - Hi, Monica. - Hi, Chandler.
UNK: It's really nice to see you. Not!
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : I'll see if I can find Ross.
UNK: Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.
Monica : Do not let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Ross : Listen, Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Adrienne : Oh, believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
UNK: Oool.
Ross : No way.
Ross : I didn't know you knew about that.
UNK: Well, I did. And it hurt.
UNK: That's when I wrote the song "Betrayal in the Oommon Room."
UNK: That's why that song had so much power.
Phoebe : Man, I'm sorry.
UNK: Look, that was a long time ago.
UNK: So I made out with Adrienne, and you made out with Missy.
Ross : Well, I guess we're even.
Ross : We are even, right?
Chandler : One more thing. I was so pissed at you that night, I wanted to get back at you.
UNK: So I thought, "Who does Ross like more than anybody?"
Ross : What did you do to my mom?
Chandler : Not her.
UNK: I am so drunk.
Monica : That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and don't feel anything.
UNK: So you girls having fun?
UNK: For your information, ass-munch...
Monica : ...I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
UNK: Pizza Guy : - Somebody order a pizza? - Oh, that's me!
UNK: I am so not gonna do good on my SATs tomorrow.
UNK: Well, maybe you could go to school here next year and we could totally hang out.
UNK: Oh, yeah. There's a plan.
Rachel : Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now.
UNK: Well, maybe you could get in on a beauty scholarship.
Rachel : What a line.
Chandler : - So where are you applying to? - Well...
UNK: ...I think it's kind of really important that I go somewhere where there's sun.
UNK: So I'm sort of... Hey!
Chandler : I'm in college, and I'm in a band.
Phoebe : Yeah, okay.
