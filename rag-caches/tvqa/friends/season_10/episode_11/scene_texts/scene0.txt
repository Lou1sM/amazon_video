Joey : - Hey, guys... - Wait! Let me tell them.
Joey : - Sure. - Joey's gonna be...
Monica : ...a celebrity guest on a game show.
Ross : Really? Which one?
Monica : Fish. Seaweed.
Monica : - A sunken ship. - Things you find in the ocean.
UNK: - You're gonna be on Pyramid! - Yeah.
Monica : - That was our favorite game show ever. - Except for Match Game.
UNK: Or Win, Lose or Draw.
Chandler : What did I marry into?
UNK: You guys wanna come and watch me tape the show?
UNK: Oh, we can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Phoebe : Yeah. Sorry, boys, this ride's closing.
Ross : And Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing.
Ross : I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
UNK: Seriously?
Monica : Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Chandler : You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler.
Monica : Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Rachel : Oh, God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Chandler : I'm leaving you.
UNK: It's so weird to see all these people again.
UNK: Oh, my God, look. There's Jeffrey Klarik.
Chandler : - Who? - He was roommates with John Rosoff.
UNK: He went out with Andrea Tamborino.
Ross : She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Chandler : Did I go to this school?
Ross : Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Chandler : Sure. Nice.
Ross : Dude, you're married to my sister.
Chandler : You're right. By saying "nice," I'm virtually licking her.
Ross : Hey, I hear she's single again. You think I should ask her out?
Chandler : Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Ross : Yes, please.
Ross : Hey. Hey, check out the fliers for the band.
UNK: - I made them on a Macintosh. - Awesome.
Chandler : The name really stands out.
Ross : Thanks to a little something called Helvetica Bold 24-point.
Chandler : Man, we're gonna rock that Asian Student Union.
Joey : - Hey, guys. - Hey, Missy.
Chandler : - Our band is playing on Friday. - Yeah, you should come check us out.
UNK: We're called Way/No Way.
Ross : - No way. - Way.
UNK: - Great. I'll be there. - Fresh.
Ross : - Boss. - Mint.
Ross : - She's gone. - I know it.
UNK: - I am totally gonna ask her out. - Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Chandler : - I said it first, bro. - Well, I thought it first, Homes.
UNK: - Look, if you date... - Wait! Wait! What are we doing?
Ross : What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl.
Ross : I mean, we can get laid any time we want.
UNK: Totally.
Chandler : - I had sex in high school. - Me too. I'm good at it.
UNK: All right, I say we make a pact.
Chandler : Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Ross : You got it.
UNK: That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Oates and Molly Ringwald...
UNK: ...who we can't go out with. - Those are the pacts.
Chandler : And Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Ross : Maybe not you.
Chandler : Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Ross : Thank you.
