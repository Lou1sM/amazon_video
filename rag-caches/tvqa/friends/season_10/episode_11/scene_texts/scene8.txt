UNK: You just lost me 1 0 grand.
Joey : Oh, wow.
UNK: I'm so sorry. Okay, I promise, we'll do better next time.
Gene : Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
UNK: Hey, some of those are pretty hard.
Joey : Like, why would there be a ghost in my fridge?
UNK: Yeah.
Ross : - So Saturday night? - I'd love to.
UNK: Great.
Missy : So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ross : Oh, well, this is gonna sound kind of silly...
Ross : ...but do you remember my roommate, Chandler Bing?
Missy : Sure. He was in your "band."
UNK: It's been 1 6 years, but the air quotes still hurt.
Phoebe : - Sorry. - That's okay. Anyway...
Ross : Well, he and I both really liked you a lot...
UNK: ...but we didn't want it to jeopardize our friendship, so we made a pact...
Ross : ...that neither of us could ask you out.
Ross : - Really? - Yeah, why?
Missy : Well, Chandler and I used to make out.
Ross : A lot.
Chandler : - You did? - Yeah.
UNK: - We'd go to the science lab after-hours. - And on my turf?!
Monica : Hey, where is this guy? It's been over an hour.
Rachel : He's coming from Jersey. He said he'd get here as fast as he could.
UNK: Oh, by the way, Phoebe's friend Marge found an earring in cucumber sandwich.
UNK: Well, it's not mi...
UNK: I am not on my game today.
Monica : - Who is it? - It's the police.
Man : The police!
Man : That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.
Monica : What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
UNK: Roy, The Male Stripper : That's a lot of stairs.
UNK: Boy.
Roy : You should warn people there's no elevator.
Roy : I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
UNK: Are you gonna be okay, Officer...?
Man : - Goodbody. - lf you say so.
Roy : So where's the young lady...
UNK: ...who I am supposed to take downtown?
Rachel : Oh, God.
UNK: You, my dear, are under arrest.
UNK: Oardiac arrest?
Roy : All right. Somebody show me where to plug in my box...
Roy : ...and we'll get this party started.
UNK: - Over here? - Yeah.
Chandler : - All right. - Rachel?
Phoebe : - Yeah? - Are you kidding?
UNK: We didn't know you wanted a stripper, so we got the phone book...
UNK: ...and got the first name we could find. - How old's your phone book?
Monica : Oh, my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment.
Phoebe : God, no. I don't wanna see him take his clothes off.
Roy : Are you talking about me?
UNK: No.
UNK: I mean, obviously we wanna see you take your clothes off.
Monica : You big piece of eye candy.
