UNK: That's right. You're making a commitment.
UNK: You know, that's the same whether you do it at the Plaza or...
UNK: - Where you gonna do it? - City Hall.
Monica : Oh, that sounds nice.
UNK: I was just there for jury duty. They've really spruced that place up.
UNK: Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I've made my decision.
Phoebe : What I really want is a great big wedding.
UNK: - But you gave all the money to charity. - Well, I'll just ask for it back.

UNK: That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.
