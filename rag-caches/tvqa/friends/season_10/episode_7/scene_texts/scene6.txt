UNK: Adoption!
Joey : What's going on?
UNK: Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...
Chandler : ...Bert, roaming the halls.
Ross : - Guys? - Keep on roaming, Bert!
Monica : We don't want any crazy today!
UNK: Is he all right out there by himself?
Chandler : Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker. His older brother...
UNK: ...Ernie.
Laura : - Bert and Ernie? - You can't make this stuff up.
Joey : - What's going on? - We'll talk later! Everything's fine!
Joey : Everything doesn't sound fine.
UNK: Bert and Ernie have a big yellow bird.
Mike : You never told me about that guy and your sweet 16.
UNK: - I'm sorry about that. - Oh, it ended okay.
Phoebe : One of my friends shot him.
UNK: At least you'll get a proper wedding. You really deserve that.
Phoebe : Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up.
UNK: Just like the kids I took the money from.
Mike : No. No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
UNK: I'm sorry, but I want to regive the money to the children.
UNK: But we can't. I mean, you called that guy a sweaty little man.
UNK: Unless you were talking about me. We never really cleared that up.
Phoebe : Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Mike : Fine, we'll give the money back.
Phoebe : If that guy at the charity gives us a hard time...
UNK: ...my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
Laura : I must say this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.
UNK: You are welcome to look under any of the furniture...
UNK: ...because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there.
Laura : Before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here.
Monica : Why don't I show you the baby's room.
Ross : - What are you doing? - You wouldn't let me in.
Joey : - I thought you were in trouble. - Well, we're not.
UNK: But you called me "Bert. "
Joey : That's our code word for danger.
Chandler : - We don't have a code word. - We don't?
Joey : We really should.
UNK: From now on, "Bert" will be our code word for danger.
Monica : So that was the baby's room.
Monica : - What room should we see next? - Any room that isn't behind this couch.
UNK: Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny.
Joey : I did not care for that.
UNK: You have to leave.
UNK: You slept with our sociaI worker and never called her back.
UNK: She is still pissed, so she can't see you.
Ross : Okay, okay.
Ross : - What? - I forgot my bat.
Rachel : Oh, my God.
Chandler : And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you!
UNK: And we don't wanna buy your bat!
Laura : What are you doing here?
Joey : Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.
Laura : - Are you friends with him? - I can explain.
UNK: Joey?
UNK: All right. Okay.
Joey : You have got some nerve coming back here.
Joey : - I can't believe you never called me. - Excuse me?
UNK: You probably don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way.
