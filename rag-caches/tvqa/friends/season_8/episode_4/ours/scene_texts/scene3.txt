UNK: I'd like to talk about something I'm uncomfortable talking about.
UNK: Sure.
UNK: How about you showering with your mom?
Ross : I actually had a topic in mind.
UNK: I'm kind of going through a dry spell, sex-wise.
Joey : -For, like, months? -Five, to be..
Ross : lying. Six.
UNK: Six months? That's rough.
UNK: It's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the small things, like..
Ross : the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
UNK: The sky's blue, Ross. And I had sex yesterday.
Ross : Please help me. I have a date tonight.
Ross : It has to go well. I'm scared for my health.
Joey : I got something. It's this story that I came up with.
Joey : Very romantic. Any woman that hears it is putty.
Ross : Tell it to me.
UNK: Now, you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it.
Joey : Remember, it is just the story.
UNK: I'll try to control myself.
UNK: Years ago, I was backpacking across Western Europe..
UNK: -You were backpacking across Europe? -Have a nice six more months.
UNK: I'm sorry. Please, please. You were in Western Europe, and..?
UNK: I was outside Barcelona, hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
UNK: -Nice. -Thanks.
Joey : I was at the end of this path, and there was a lake.
Joey : Very secluded. There were tall trees all around.
Joey : It was dead silent. Gorgeous.
Joey : And across the lake I saw a beautiful woman bathing herself.
Joey : But she was crying.
UNK: Why?
