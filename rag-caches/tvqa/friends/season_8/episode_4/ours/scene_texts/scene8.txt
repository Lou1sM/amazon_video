UNK: Anyway, it probably worked out for the best.
Rachel : Yeah, sure.
UNK: In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.
UNK: In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.
Rachel : Did I ever tell you about the time I backpacked through Western Europe?
UNK: Get ready to see some begging.
Phoebe : -Oh, you came on to Ross! -What?
UNK: Now I'm so happy.
UNK: -What? -You used the Europe story!
UNK: That's the magic story you use when you want to have sex!
Rachel : -How do you know about that story? -How do you know about that story?
UNK: My friend Irene heard it from some guy.
Rachel : Some guy!
UNK: No, she told me that his name was Ken Adams.
Joey : Ken Adams!
UNK: So, people are familiar with the Europe story?
UNK: About that, the "who came on to who" thing really doesn't matter.
UNK: It would have happened either way.
UNK: If you hadn't initiated it, I know I would have.
Rachel : -It was an amazing night. -It was. It was amazing.
Rachel : You think it looked amazing?
UNK: I don't know. I honestly didn't watch it.
Rachel : Yeah, me neither.
UNK: Yet.
Ross : -That may be weird. -Yeah, it would be really weird.
Joey : -Good luck. -Good luck to you.
Ross : -Mind if I mute? -Oh, please.
Ross : -There go the clothes. -You are undressing awfully quickly.
Ross : Six months, Rachel. Six months.
Ross : -We look pretty good. -I was gonna say.
Ross : -Nice tan. -Thank you.
UNK: I'd just gone to the beach that weekend.
Rachel : -Have you been working out? -I have been working out.
Rachel : This is so much better than I ever..
UNK: Oh, that's not pretty.
Rachel : -Make it stop. Make it stop. -Oh, no!
UNK: Greg and Jenny's number is totally different in here.
UNK: -I don't ask too many questions, do I? -No.
UNK: -Really? -Absolutely not.
UNK: -Really? -Oh, God.
UNK: I bet that phone thing was some sort of mix-up. I'm gonna call them.
Monica : Hello, Greg? This is Monica from the plane.
Monica : Listen, the number that you gave me, 8-5-3..
UNK: Jenny's been giving out their old number!
Chandler : Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Monica : How would you like to get together next Saturday?
Monica : Okay, how about Sunday?
UNK: Okay, the week after that?
Monica : The week after that?
UNK: You know what? We are interesting, funny people with good questions.
Monica : And if you and your precious Jenny can't see that..
Monica : January 15?
UNK: We'll see you then!
