Phoebe : Come on in!
Phoebe : How was the honeymoon?
UNK: So much fun. The best part is, we met this great couple.
Phoebe : That was the best part? Good honeymooning, tiger.
UNK: They're cool. It was their honeymoon too.
UNK: They live here in the city.
Monica : Can we go call them? Is it too soon to call?
UNK: We're excited. We finally have a couple to hang out with.
UNK: Oh, were you looking for that?
UNK: Well, yeah.
Joey : A couple? Like two people? Like one, two people?
UNK: It's different. Greg and Jenny are married.
Monica : Greg and Jenny? "Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."
UNK: "Hi, Monica. This is Jenny." "Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."
UNK: -They're great. If you just.. -You know what?
Joey : Give us our souvenirs and get out of here.
UNK: -We didn't get a chance to.. -You're kidding!
UNK: -We didn't get anything for anyone. -Nice necklace.
Monica : That you can have.
UNK: Yeah, we are. It's so exciting.
UNK: I always knew you two would have a child out of wedlock.
Rachel : -Look, I have a sonogram picture. -Good.
UNK: Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.
UNK: Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen? When? How many times?
UNK: Monica, that's not right. Start with where.
Rachel : It happened about six weeks ago.
UNK: I got home and Ross was there. He'd been hanging out with Joey.
UNK: You're welcome, buddy.
Ross : Yeah, thanks.
Rachel : I had a lot of work, and Ross offered to help.
UNK: We had wine, we got to talking.
Rachel : Next thing you know, Ross comes on to me.
UNK: That's a little misleading.
Rachel : -What is? -The lie you just told.
Rachel : -That you came on to me? -There's the one!
UNK: -But you did. Let's be honest. -Yes, let's.
UNK: Ross. If it helps, I don't believe you.
UNK: It's not important.
UNK: What's important is, we're having a baby, not who came on to who.
UNK: "Whom."
UNK: That's right.
Rachel : -You kissed me first. -You were begging for it!
Ross : You were sending me signals!
UNK: I was sending signals? Anyone think that I'd send Ross begging signals?
Rachel : Please, show of hands.
UNK: It doesn't matter what people believe! It happened.
Rachel : Maybe I need to be more careful. Am I sending these signals now?
UNK: -You know what? Just drop it. -Show me how I begged you.
Ross : I can show you! I have it on videotape.
UNK: It's an expression.
