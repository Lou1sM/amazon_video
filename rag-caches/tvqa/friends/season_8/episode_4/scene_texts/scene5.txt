UNK: Great. I'm across the street having sex right now.
Ross : -Your story sucks. -Then you didn't tell it right.
Joey : -Show me how you did it. -No, I don't want to.
UNK: -How long since you seen a girl naked? -I was backpacking..
UNK: -I'm not feeling it. -I was outside Barcelona, hiking..
UNK: -Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot? -It's been six months. I'm always hot.
UNK: You're not selling the story. You don't believe it.
Joey : I gotta go, I got a date. But try this.
UNK: Do what I do before an audition.
UNK: I'm not hungry.
UNK: No.
UNK: Use my camera to record yourself and see what you're doing wrong.
UNK: I'll try that.
UNK: Now, you're all set up. Good to go. Just hit record. Good luck.
Ross : If you ever have any problem with the ladies, you know I'll help you out.
Joey : That means a lot to me, man.
Ross : Can I get you anything? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?
UNK: Ross, thank God you're here. You have to help me.
UNK: Were you talking to yourself?
UNK: That's less embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was.
Ross : When she came in, I totally forgot about the camera.
Ross : It kept rolling and recorded everything.
UNK: Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
Ross : What a great idea! That'll get Rachel to forgive me.
UNK: Come on, it'll be like watching the Discovery Channel..
UNK: only we'll know the monkeys.
UNK: Look, I'm not gonna let you guys watch us.
UNK: -I haven't even seen it yet. -I'll trade you two tapes of me having sex.
UNK: Thanks, I'm good.
UNK: We don't wanna see the dirty stuff..
Phoebe : -just the stuff leading up to it. -No. Rachel's gonna kill me as it is.
UNK: It's not fair to her. Let's forget the tape.
Ross : Thank you.
UNK: -No. -You're right.
Ross : -Joey, no. -Loud and clear.
UNK: I don't get why they'd give us a fake number.
Joey : If they knew what they were doing, they didn't give you real names.
Monica : Maybe people give out fake numbers, but not fake names.
Joey : Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.
UNK: Regina Phalange.
UNK: -We didn't do anything wrong. -I know.
