UNK: Come on, Rachel, open up. Let me explain.
UNK: -Still won't let you in, huh? -No.
UNK: I'm just gonna close this door so we can talk about you.
UNK: I can't believe he taped them having sex.
Joey : Yeah. You gotta tell a girl before you tape her.
Joey : Such a rookie mistake.
UNK: -Know who has a great camera? -Greg and Jenny?
UNK: -I want to call them. -Let's call.
Joey : Ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs.
UNK: Hello. 8th Street Deli?
Joey : Hang up. You get food poisoning just talking to that place.
Monica : -Sorry, wrong number. -Here you go, babe.
UNK: Hello? It's the deli again!
UNK: All right, I'll have a sandwich.
UNK: I don't think this number's right.
UNK: -What? -You got fake-numbered.
UNK: -What? People don't do that. -Oh, I think we do.
Monica : -Why would they do that? -I don't know.
Chandler : You were a delight. You asked those great questions.
UNK: And you were never funnier. Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!
Joey : You still got me and Phoebe.
UNK: Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
UNK: Rachel won't talk to me. She won't open the door.
Phoebe : I wonder why, pervert.
UNK: Okay, I am not a pervert.
UNK: That's, like, the pervert motto.
UNK: You raise your hand, put your left hand down your pants and repeat that.
UNK: Filming Rachel was not planned.
UNK: Here's what happened. Joey can back me up.
UNK: A month and a half ago, remember I came to you with a problem?
UNK: The personal thing?
Joey : -What personal thing? -About sex?
UNK: That I hadn't had sex in months?
Joey : Yeah, I knew what you were talking about.
