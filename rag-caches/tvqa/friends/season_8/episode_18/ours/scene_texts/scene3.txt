Parker : Oysters! Let me feed you. That's not necessary.
UNK: -Please? -I don't eat..
UNK: -I won't quit until you try one. -Okay, fine.
UNK: -Good. -What're they like? I've never had one.
Phoebe : -Try one. -They look too weird.
Joey : I know, I know.
UNK: Listen, your family is really starting to warm up to me.
UNK: You just kissed the caterer.
Chandler : -What are you doing? -Going over my toast.
UNK: I can't wait. They'll cry so hard, they'll be fighting for breath.
UNK: If you want to, I could just hold them down and you could just..
Rachel : And my veil was lace, made by blind Belgian nuns.
UNK: -Blind? -Not at first, but it's intricate work.
Rachel : They said even though they lost their sight, it was worth it.
UNK: -I bet you looked beautiful. -Well, I don't know.
UNK: But there were some people that said I looked like a floating angel.
Woman : -How did you propose? -Oh, yeah, that's a great story.
UNK: Well, actually, I took her to the planetarium.
UNK: That's where we had our first date.
Ross : I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower.
UNK: Aunt Lisa : -That is so sweet! -I want to hear the rest!
Ross : Then Fred Astaire singing, "The Way You Look Tonight" came on..
Ross : the lights came down, I got on one knee..
Ross : and written across the dome, in the stars, were the words :
Ross : "Will you marry me?"
Rachel : And the ring was the size of my fist.
UNK: Hey, Phoebe? Look..
UNK: I want to apologize. Okay? We were being jerks.
UNK: -Parker's nice, I'd like to know him. -You better do it now.
UNK: -Why? -Because I'm gonna kill him.
UNK: -What? -He's too excited about everything.
UNK: I'm all for living, but this is the Gellers' 35th anniversary.
UNK: Let's call a spade a spade. This party stinks.
UNK: I'm having the worst time.
UNK: There was a line for the buffet, and when I got to the plates..
Joey : I slipped on a giant booger.
UNK: Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
UNK: It could've been. I didn't look at it.
UNK: I wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out.
UNK: I thought he was a great guy. I was so excited about him.
UNK: Well, hey, you should be excited about him.
UNK: There's nothing wrong with him.
Phoebe : -You think? -Yeah, know what?
Joey : -We were all just being too negative. -You're right.
UNK: He's just embracing life. We could all stand to be more like Parker.
UNK: You know what? I'm like him! I'm a positive person!
UNK: -Actually, you have an edge. -What's that?
UNK: -Oh, it's Parker! -Look, the Bunny Hop!
Phoebe : -Oh, I love it! -You do?
Phoebe : Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music? Come on!
UNK: Okay, it's time for the toast.
UNK: I know normally Ross gives the toast, but this year I'll do it.
UNK: No, it's gonna be great. Really.
UNK: Okay.
Monica : Mom, Dad, when I got married..
UNK: the thing that made me sure I could do it was the example you two set.
UNK: For that, and other things, I want to thank you.
UNK: I know I probably don't say it enough..
Monica : but I love you.
UNK: When I look around, I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here.
Monica : Nana, my beloved grandmother, who would so want to be here.
UNK: But she can't..
UNK: because she's dead.
Monica : As is our dog, Chi-Chi.
UNK: I mean, look how cute she is.. was.
