UNK: Aunt Lisa : Congratulations on the baby and on the wedding.
UNK: -Here's something to start you out. -How's marriage treating you?
UNK: -Unbelievable. It's great! -We love marriage.
UNK: We'll see you later.
UNK: -Hey! -Hi!
UNK: Can I just say, Monica, that your driving is exquisite.
UNK: Thanks. Like I said before, I pretty much just stayed in the lines..
UNK: and tried not to hit anybody.
Parker : What a beautiful place. What a great night.
Parker : I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C..
UNK: I feel so lucky. Think of the good times that happened here.
Parker : The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!
UNK: None will compare with tonight. I don't want to forget it.
UNK: It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all. Click.
UNK: I don't think the flash went off.
UNK: -I'm gonna find the men's room. -I'll go with you.
Chandler : Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun..
Chandler : and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
UNK: I have to go too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
UNK: Glad we weren't in the car. Did he let up?
Monica : He called the Long Island Expressway a "concrete miracle."
Ross : This room. This night.
Ross : That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture!
UNK: Sorry.
Phoebe : Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Ross : That depends, how much did you hear?
UNK: He's a little enthusiastic. What's wrong with that?
UNK: -It's so much. -Well, so what? I like him.
UNK: Do I make fun of the people you date? Tag, Janice, Mona.
UNK: No, because friends don't do that. Do you want my opinion?
Phoebe : Your collective dating record reads like a who's who of human crap!
Monica : -I feel terrible. -I know.
Ross : What was wrong with Mona?
Rachel : -Open it, open it, open it. -Yeah, baby!
Man : So we never got to hear about your wedding.
UNK: -We were surprised we weren't invited. -No, it was a small wedding.
Rachel : But it was beautiful. It was small, but kind of spectacular.
Man : -Where did you have it? -On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.
UNK: And Stevie Wonder sang " Isn't She Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.
UNK: -Stevie's a family friend. -Oh, my God. That's amazing.
Woman : -I'd love to see pictures. -Yeah, so would I.
UNK: You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz would forget to put film in the camera.
Ross : Would you excuse us for a second?
Chandler : -What are you doing? -What? This may be my only wedding.
UNK: -And I want it to be amazing. -Okay.
Ross : -Maybe I rode in on a Harley. -Ross, it has to be realistic.
UNK: Say, are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
UNK: -No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you. -And I'm with you. What a great time!
UNK: Look at this plate bouncy thing.
UNK: What an inspired solution to man's plate-dispensing problems.
