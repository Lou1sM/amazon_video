UNK: -What? -You're the 200-pounder who rode her!
UNK: Hey! Everybody, this is Parker. Parker, this is..
UNK: No, don't tell me. Let me guess : Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel..
UNK: and I'm sorry, Phoebe didn't mention you.
UNK: Chandler, I'm kidding! Already you're my favorite.
UNK: -Tell me a little about yourselves. -Actually, we should get going.
Parker : Classic Ross!
UNK: Rachel, look how you glow! May I?
Rachel : I think you already are.
Parker : Rachel, you have life growing inside you.
UNK: Is there anything more miraculous.. A picture of a dog! Whose is this?
UNK: That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Parker : Well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.
UNK: You guys, we really should get going.
UNK: There I go again, my catch phrase.
UNK: -So where's the party? -It's in Massapequa.
UNK: Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is it steeped in Native American history?
UNK: Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tepee.
UNK: I've got my notes. You got the presents?
UNK: -I've got the car keys. -We're driving? Aces.
Ross : -So he seems like a nice guy. -Yeah, I like him a lot.
UNK: -You want to hang back and take a cab? -Okay, otherwise I'm not going.
Ross : -Hey, Mom. -This is such a great party!
UNK: Thirty-five years. Impressive. Do you have any pearls of wisdom?
UNK: -Jack? -Why serve food on such a sharp stick?
UNK: It's a good question, Dad. It's a good question.
Woman : -Congratulations, you two. -Thank you, we're so excited.
Woman : And also, congratulations on your wedding.
UNK: -Can we talk to you for just a moment? -Yeah.
UNK: It's just a little thing.
UNK: While we think it's marvelous you're having this baby out of wedlock..
UNK: Mrs. Geller : our friends are less open-minded.
UNK: -We told them you're married. -What?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Thanks for going along with this.
UNK: -We have to pretend that we're married? -I had to shave my ears.
UNK: Mr. Geller : You can do this.
Ross : -Can you believe that? -I know.
UNK: If you do the ears, you may as well take a pass at the nose.
UNK: I don't want to have to lie about being married.
UNK: I don't either. But it's their party, and it's one night.
UNK: We don't have to lie. We won't talk.
Rachel : If it comes up, we'll smile, we'll nod along..
UNK: -Ross? -Rachel?
Ross : Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.
