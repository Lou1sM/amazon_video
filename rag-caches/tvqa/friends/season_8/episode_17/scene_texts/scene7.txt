UNK: -You didn't have to come in. -You kidding?
Monica : This is where they get out stains. This is like Disneyland for me.
UNK: I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Guy : Excuse me. I think you dropped..
UNK: -Wow! -What?
UNK: Sorry. You're just so incredibly beautiful.
UNK: Well, I'm sorry about that too. But what are you gonna do?
UNK: Don't think I'm crazy, but I was meant to pick this up.
Guy : -Do you believe in that kind of thing? -A little.
UNK: Now you're talking.
UNK: -Want to go for coffee? -I'd love to. Let me tell my friend.
Monica : An ink stain! Can I watch how you get this out?
UNK: She must have left.
UNK: -So? What happened? -It's all gonna be okay.
UNK: They're so happy I'm not suing, I got an extra month paid maternity leave.
UNK: So long as I understand the money should not be construed..
Rachel : as a down payment on this or any other child.
UNK: Ralph Lauren is going out of their way..
UNK: to show they're not in the baby-buying business.
Rachel : -Give us a minute? -Kicking me out of my living room?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I'll be in there.
UNK: I'm sorry I lied to you. I was just trying to make things..
Joey : I know. I know.
UNK: It kind of worked.
UNK: I don't know about you, but I haven't thought about our thing.
UNK: Yeah, you're right.
UNK: Yeah. It's kind of been like "us" again, a little bit.
UNK: -Yeah, I know. I've missed that. -Me too.
UNK: I haven't thought about how I put myself out there..
UNK: and said that stuff. How you didn't feel the same..
Joey : and how it was really awkward.
Rachel : My gynecologist tried to kill me.
UNK: Item J437-A.
Color : winterberry.
UNK: Hi, listen. Come here. Come..
UNK: I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.
UNK: But what did I tell you about leaving your key outside the door like that?
UNK: I mean, you're lucky it was me and not someone else.
UNK: I guess lucky is too strong a word.
UNK: Anyway, Mona, I'm really, really sorry. It's just..
UNK: Listen, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
Phoebe : -You do? -Yeah. You still have feelings for me.
Mona : To be honest, I still have feelings for you.
UNK: I wish we could work it out, but we can't.
UNK: It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby. I just..
UNK: It just wasn't meant to be.
UNK: Oh, God. You're right.
UNK: Ross, we have to be strong.
UNK: Okay, I'm gonna go.
Mona : Can I? To remember you?
UNK: No.
