UNK: -Okay. -Oh, and you know what?
UNK: While you're helping solve this problem..
UNK: you might want to do something with your hands. Like, off the top of my head..
UNK: maybe put the CDs in their right cases.
UNK: Here we go.
UNK: So you have a big work problem?
UNK: Yeah. It's, uh..
UNK: Yeah, it's, uh..
UNK: You know, it's nothing.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: So I think I'm gonna take off.
UNK: No, wait, Joey, it is. It's something. It's..
UNK: It's my boss.
UNK: -Yeah? -Yeah. And, uh..
UNK: And my baby.
UNK: Yeah?
Rachel : My boss wants to buy my baby.
UNK: What? Oh, my God!
Rachel : I know, I told you, it's a really big problem!
Joey : -He wants to buy your baby? -Can you believe that?
UNK: -That's crazy. -That's what I told him!
Joey : -How did this even happen? -Well, I'll tell you.
UNK: See, my boss and his wife, they can't have children, so..
UNK: And then when we were at the Christmas party..
UNK: he got drunk and said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
Joey : When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby..
Joey : I figured it was about maternity leave.
Phoebe : Oh. Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, that would have been a much simpler problem.
Phoebe : -Oh, hello. -Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.
UNK: I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.
UNK: Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson. I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.
UNK: -We've seen each other a lot lately. -Yes.
UNK: Maybe we'll see each other at dinner tomorrow. Around 8 : 00?
Phoebe : Well, maybe we will.
UNK: Mona?
Ross : Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
UNK: Upstream.
UNK: Damn, nobody's here for my good ones.
Mona : I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
UNK: -It's okay. -No, it's still wet.
Mona : Let me get it out before it sets. I have something you could wear.
UNK: Here.
UNK: I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
UNK: -That's a man's shirt. -Awfully pink.
UNK: It's not pink!
Chandler : Honey, we are so meant to be together.
UNK: -We both have the Annie soundtrack. -Honey, both yours.
Rachel : Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.
Monica : -The work problem? -It was perfect.
UNK: It felt like he was my friend.
UNK: -What problem did you say you have? -Oh, that's not important.
Rachel : The point is, I think everything's gonna be okay.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : May I help you?
Joey : You think you can just buy my friend's baby?
UNK: Isn't it funny how we kept meeting? It's as if someone wants us together.
