UNK: -Hey. -Joey, honey, listen.
UNK: Thanks for talking to me yesterday. It meant a lot.
Joey : Not a problem. Just so you know..
UNK: that guy won't be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
UNK: -What? -Let's just say I took care of it.
UNK: Let's say more.
UNK: Don't worry. I told him, very nicely :
UNK: "You don't go buying people's babies! So back off!"
UNK: -What? -What?
Rachel : No, no, no!
UNK: He doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!
Joey : What? Why?
UNK: So we would have something to talk about!
UNK: And you couldn't think of anything else?
Monica : You said your boss wants to buy your baby?
Rachel : You yelled at my boss! I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?
UNK: You could always sell your baby.
UNK: I can't believe you brought my boss into it! I'll be fired!
Joey : -You lied to me! -Well, she told me to!
Monica : Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: -Ross! -Hello!
Mona : What are you doing?
Ross : Not touching myself, if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
UNK: Okay, then. I'll call you.
Rachel : Morning. You wanted to see me?
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Please, come in. Have a seat.
Rachel : -Look, Mr. Zelner.. -It's best I speak first.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Lee from Human Resources is here as a witness to our conversation.
Joey : Oh, God.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby..
UNK: Mr. Zelner : I am sorry. Okay?
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Last week, when I asked you when your due date was..
UNK: Mr. Zelner : I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was "due" your baby.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : I want to be very clear..
UNK: Mr. Zelner : that I understand that it's your baby..
UNK: Mr. Zelner : and it is not mine to purchase.
Rachel : Well, as long as we are clear about that.
Phoebe : There it is.
UNK: -Not your regular cleaners. -I know.
UNK: That creep goes there. I had to find a new one.
