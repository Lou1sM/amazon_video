UNK: Mine is a picture of the Village People. What does that mean?
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
Monica : Tea gives Phoebe the trots!
Rachel : I thought Joey and I would be okay..
UNK: but we don't know how to be together.
UNK: By the way, I've been meaning to say this.
UNK: If you guys knew about this, a heads-up would have been nice.
UNK: Just a little, you know.
UNK: "Joey loves you. Be prepared."
UNK: -Sorry. -Well, for next time.
UNK: -It's tough, but things will improve. -How do you know?
UNK: What if it gets worse and worse..
Rachel : to the point where we can't be in the same room?
UNK: I'm not great at the advice.
Chandler : Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?
Chandler : Some cheese?
UNK: Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Cat Stevens case?
UNK: If I can't find the right case, I use the nearest one.
UNK: -Where is the Cat Stevens CD? -The James Taylor case.
UNK: -Where is that CD? -I'll save you time.
UNK: Two hundred CDs, not one of them in the right case.
Monica : Okay. No need to panic. Deep breaths, everyone.
UNK: We'll just have to put the CDs in their right cases.
UNK: If we do that, we should come up with some kind of order.
UNK: We have to talk this through.
UNK: Oh, my God, you have such problems! I feel so terrible for you!
UNK: All right. Okay, I'm sorry.
UNK: You're both focusing on this uncomfortable thing.
Monica : Change the subject.
Monica : Get him talking about something else.
Rachel : Yeah, that makes sense.
UNK: Maybe you need his advice on a work problem..
UNK: -I could do that. -Good.
Monica : The Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Chandler : They were just giving those away at the store.
Chandler : In exchange for money.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: I really don't know what to tell you.
UNK: Maybe Joey could help you out with your big work problem.
UNK: -What? -Yeah, Joey, she's..
UNK: Rachel's got this big work problem. It is a head-scratcher.
UNK: Know what? If we're gonna make dinner, we're gonna have to leave.
UNK: Yeah, Joey, maybe you could help her out.
