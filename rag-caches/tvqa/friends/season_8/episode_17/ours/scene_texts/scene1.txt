UNK: -Hey! -Hey, Rachel.
Rachel : Is Joey here?
UNK: -I don't see him. You? -No.
UNK: Maybe he's in the sugar bowl. Joey? Nope.
Rachel : Well, at least you make each other laugh.
UNK: -What's up? -I haven't seen him since he said..
UNK: how he, you know..
UNK: I don't know, I think he's avoiding me.
Rachel : Why is that bagel on the floor?
Monica : -We were playing a game. -Was Chandler naked?
UNK: Sort of like a ring-toss kind of situation?
UNK: -Sure! -What? No! No!
UNK: All right, listen. If you see Joey, will you just tell him that..?
Rachel : Tell him I miss him.
Monica : -Okay. Did you hear that? -Yeah. That naked bagel game?
UNK: Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
UNK: -You've gotta talk to her. -I can't.
UNK: You guys don't know what it's like to get shot down.
UNK: I don't know what that's like?
UNK: Until I was 25, I thought the response to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."
Monica : No rejection?
Monica : I got shot down at fat camp.
Monica : Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
Joey : So, what do I do?
UNK: It's Rachel. You're gonna never talk to her again?
UNK: It's weird and it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Joey : Yeah, okay.
UNK: I forgot this was on your..
UNK: We didn't play it!
UNK: And one of the great joys of life..
UNK: is its wondrous unpredictability, you know?
Phoebe : And also, tea tends to give me the trots.
UNK: -Okay. I'm done. Read mine. -Okay.
Phoebe : I see a ladder.
Phoebe : Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
UNK: I'm the head chef. I can't get promoted.
UNK: Who's next?
UNK: I'm done. Do mine.
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : Oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Phoebe : Which can either mean you're having a baby..
UNK: or you'll make a scientific discovery!
Rachel : Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Chandler : -What does yours say, Pheebs? -All right.
Phoebe : Wow! Yay!
UNK: Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon!
UNK: He's gonna be the man of my dreams.
Phoebe : Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
Ross : Has anyone seen my shirt?
UNK: It's a button-down, like a faded salmon color?
Monica : You mean your pink shirt?
Ross : Faded salmon color?
UNK: No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.
UNK: I must have left it at Mona's. I knew it!
UNK: I'm sure you can get another one at Ann Taylor's.
UNK: That's my favorite shirt. I love it.
Rachel : Ask Mona to give it back.
UNK: I don't know. I could.
UNK: We didn't really end things on good terms.
UNK: If I went, I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do..
Ross : jump up my own ass and die.
Phoebe : Oh, wait a second, you guys?
UNK: I've been seeing that guy everywhere I go.
Phoebe : We take the same bus, go to the same bookstore.
UNK: Maybe he's the tea guy.
Chandler : Did you see that?
Chandler : He totally checked you out! And he is so cute!
