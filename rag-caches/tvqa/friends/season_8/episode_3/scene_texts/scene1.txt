Phoebe : -What stuff? -Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of it.
UNK: Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.
Joey : Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency!
UNK: Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.
UNK: -Hey, did Monica and Chandler take off yet? -Yeah.
UNK: Damn. They left without my pass to the Nassau Fossil and Natural History Museum.
UNK: There goes the honeymoon.
Phoebe : -Did Rachel find you? -No, why?
Phoebe : She was looking for you.
UNK: Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
Phoebe : -She really wanted to talk to you now. -Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Monica : Oh, no.
UNK: What?
Ross : I think I might know what this is about.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Yeah. We promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this, but..
Ross : About a month ago, Rachel and I slept together.
UNK: And?
Ross : Wow, I thought you'd be a little more shocked.
UNK: Oh, sorry. And?!
UNK: Well, we said we'd just do it that one time..
Ross : but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
UNK: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
UNK: -Why? What else could it be? -Oh, wow, I don't feel well.
UNK: I'm telling you, that's what it is.
Ross : No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.
UNK: She didn't say anything to you?
UNK: -Maybe it's something you ate. -Could be, yeah.
UNK: -Please, just go and talk to Rachel. -Yeah, I guess I should.
UNK: Man, you know what I have to realize?
UNK: Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
UNK: You know, they always seem to want a little bit more.
Ross : I should remember that.
UNK: Next.
UNK: -They're kissing. Let's just go around them. -Leave them alone. They're in love.
UNK: I'm in love too. But in an orderly fashion.
UNK: Next.
Monica : Hi. Can you do that and walk? Because she said, "Next."
UNK: Sorry, we didn't hear you. We're on our honeymoon.
UNK: Let me see what I can do. There are some first-class seats available.
Monica : They bumped them up to first class because they're on their honeymoon!
UNK: -Let's act like we're on our honeymoon. -We are on our honeymoon.
Monica : Grab my ass.
UNK: -Next. -Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.
UNK: You know, I'm just so in love with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon.
UNK: -Congratulations. -Thanks.
UNK: Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J, and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.
UNK: We're on our honeymoon, so can you do your little thing and bump us to first class?
UNK: I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
UNK: See? If we'd gone around them like I said, she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!
Chandler : 25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
UNK: I still can't believe they took away my key. I mean, you trust me with yours.
Phoebe : Of course I do! And I'm gonna get it back to you..
UNK: just as soon as they're done with it at the key-shining place.
Joey : -What the hell is that? -I don't know.
Joey : Treeger, what are you doing?
UNK: Mr. Treeger : -You said there was a gas leak. -Why not use your key?
UNK: By the time I found it on this thing, the whole place might have exploded.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : If that happens at another building I manage, people will ask questions.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Come on, hurry up!
UNK: Well, we could have done that.
UNK: Look at that! They're going into the first-class lounge.
Monica : -Do you know what they have in there? -No.
Monica : Me neither. We have to get in!
Chandler : -Just act like you belong. -Oh, my God! Oranges!
