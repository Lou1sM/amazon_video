UNK: Although, we can worry about that after we get married.
UNK: -Married? -Well, yeah, I think we should get married.
UNK: Because that's your answer to everything?
UNK: No. Because that's the right thing to do.
UNK: Yeah, maybe, if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
UNK: No. But still, I mean, you can't possibly do this alone.
Rachel : Excuse me?
UNK: -You can't even eat alone in a restaurant. -What?
UNK: If you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
Rachel : -I can too eat by myself! -When have you ever?
Rachel : When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
Ross : Well, certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Rachel : Oh, please. You inhale your food.
Ross : I grew up with Monica. If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!
UNK: Dr. Long : Am I interrupting?
Rachel : No, Dr. Long. Please come in. This is Ross. He is the father.
Ross : But not the husband, because, evidently, she can do this alone.
UNK: Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
UNK: -Why you can't admit you need me? -I need you to stay near my head!
UNK: Dr. Long : Okay. Everything looks good. Here it is on the screen.
UNK: Here's your uterus..
UNK: Dr. Long : and right here is your baby.
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
Rachel : There it is. I see it.
UNK: Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
UNK: -Okay. -Thank you.
Ross : Pretty amazing, huh?
UNK: I don't see it!
UNK: -What? -I can't see it.
UNK: But you just said that you did.
UNK: I know. I lied. I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother.
UNK: I can't even see my own baby!
UNK: Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can. Come here. Look, it's right there.
UNK: Oh, it's beautiful.
Rachel : I see it now.
Ross : -Do you really? -No, I don't see it!
UNK: Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.
UNK: You see this tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Sweetie, that's it.
UNK: That's it?
Rachel : Well, I saw that.
Monica : -Thank you. -You're welcome.
UNK: Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.
UNK: Yeah, that's our baby.
UNK: Well, they put up the new door.
UNK: -So it's all locked up and secure? -Yeah. Why?
UNK: I was trying to figure out how bad I want one of Monica's turkey pot pies.
UNK: -Hi. -Hey.
Phoebe : -So how was the doctor? -Everything went great.
UNK: -Good. -Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
UNK: I don't see the baby. Where is it?
UNK: Oh, no, I know. I couldn't see it either at first. But it's right..
Rachel : Ross, I lost it again.
