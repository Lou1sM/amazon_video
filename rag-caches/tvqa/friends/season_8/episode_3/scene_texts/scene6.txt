UNK: Please, I really.. I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
UNK: -That's fine. Can you stay up near my head? -What? Oh, yeah, sorry.
UNK: I went crazy. I was thinking about myself when I should've been thinking about you..
Rachel : -Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross! -Right.
UNK: I want you to know that I'm gonna be there through this whole thing. Okay?
