UNK: Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
Monica : Yeah, I am.
UNK: That's right, get it out of your system while we're alone.
UNK: -Hey. We came to say goodbye. -Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.
UNK: -Thanks. -I better go pack.
Monica : No, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.
UNK: Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.
UNK: I'm gonna go pack my regular, long bathing suit.
UNK: Good, you're still here! I wanted to tell you to have a good honeymoon.
Monica : Thank you!
Rachel : And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today.
Rachel : What? What?
Joey : -We know it's Ross. -How? How do you know?
UNK: It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!
Rachel : I so wanted Ross to know first. But I am so relieved that you guys know!
UNK: That is so great. And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
Rachel : I know.
Phoebe : Me too!
UNK: And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.
UNK: -You're all gonna be aunts and uncles. -Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
UNK: So now that you all know, you can help me. Give me some advice on how to tell Ross.
Monica : What were you gonna say?
UNK: I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have it, and he can be as involved as he wants.
UNK: Well, that sounds good.
UNK: Yeah, but, you know, how do I start? I mean, what's the first thing that I say?
Rachel : -Okay, great. Thanks. -Hey, good luck.
Phoebe : Yeah, bye.
Chandler : Hey, what was that all about?
UNK: Guess there's no harm in telling you now. Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.
UNK: What?! I didn't even know that..! Why didn't you tell me?
Chandler : Why am I talking like this?
UNK: -I didn't think you could keep it a secret. -What?!
UNK: What?!
UNK: I am an excellent secret-keeper. I have kept all our secrets.
Joey : -What secrets? -No, no, Joey.
UNK: I'm not gonna tell you, because I am an excellent secret-keeper.
UNK: -You'll tell me later? -You already know.
Joey : -Maybe you and I should do something. -All in good time, my love. All in good time.
Phoebe : Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well, you can let me in later, right?
UNK: No, I don't have a key. They took mine to give to you.
Phoebe : -What? They took mine to give to you. -Why would they take away our keys?
UNK: Maybe they don't trust us.
Joey : They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
Phoebe : The time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?
Joey : -Hey, I washed those. -No, you didn't.
UNK: Yeah, that didn't sound like me.
UNK: -What will I do? I really need my guitar. -I have stuff in there too.
