UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
UNK: I think we do. Why don't we go inside.
UNK: -Look, I know why you're here. -You do?
Ross : Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment..
Ross : I think maybe I should talk first.
UNK: -Okay. -Okay?
Joey : Ross and Rachel.
Monica : Rachel and Ross.
UNK: That's been one heck of a seesaw, hasn't it?
UNK: What?
UNK: I mean, look, that one night we had was fun and certainly passionate.
UNK: But don't you think it's better if we just stay friends?
Rachel : Seriously, what?
UNK: Okay. You know what?
Ross : If you want to, we can do it one more time.
UNK: I mean, I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now..
UNK: Okay.
UNK: You know what? Can I talk now?
Ross : -Oh, sure. -Okay.
UNK: I'm pregnant.
UNK: Ross?
UNK: Ross?
UNK: Okay, whenever you're ready.
UNK: And you're the father, by the way. But you got..
Rachel : -Can I get you some water? -I'm good.
Rachel : Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay? I mean, you can be as involved as you want.
Monica : Yeah, I..
UNK: I'm just, I don't know. I don't understand..
Ross : how this happened.
Ross : -We used a condom. -I know.
UNK: But you know, condoms only work, like, 97 percent of the time.
UNK: What?
UNK: What?!
Ross : Well, they should put that on the box!
Phoebe : -They do. -No, they don't!
Ross : Well, they should put it in huge block letters!
UNK: -Ross, let's just forget about the condoms. -Well, I may as well have!
UNK: Listen, you know what? I was really freaked out too..
Rachel : -when I found out. -Freaked..? Hey, I'm not freaked out.
UNK: I'm indignant as a consumer!
UNK: -You know what? Let's talk later. -No, I wanna talk now.
UNK: In fact, I wanna talk..
Ross : to the president of the condom company.
UNK: Okay, you know what? Maybe I should come back.. Okay.
UNK: Yeah, I'll press one!
UNK: -I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak. -So then I can heat this up?
UNK: Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.
UNK: Great. Listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this?
