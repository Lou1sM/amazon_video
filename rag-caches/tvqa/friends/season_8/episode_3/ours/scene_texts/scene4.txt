UNK: Because, you know, they don't have any kids of their own..
Phoebe : and this door was like a child to them.
UNK: Well, I'm gonna have to put on a new lock. They'll find out anyway.
UNK: It's looking like an all-day job. I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.
UNK: Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine I can't make it to yoga class today?
UNK: Sure.
Ross : -Oh, my God! What happened to the door? -So it's noticeable, huh?
UNK: -Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her. -Didn't you two already talk?
Monica : Yeah, but..
Ross : Okay. Look, you guys know that Rachel and I slept together..
UNK: but there's something else.
UNK: Rachel's pregnant.
Phoebe : -Holy mother of God! -Oh, my God, I can't believe that!
Ross : -With my child. -That is brand-new information!
UNK: -You already know, don't you? -Little bit.
UNK: -How you doing? -Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.
UNK: It's just, I don't think I handled it very well.
UNK: -What'd you say to her? -Nothing.
Ross : But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
Ross : -Then when I turned around, she was gone. -Oh, Ross.
UNK: I know. But in my defense, I just found out that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.
UNK: -What? -I gotta go find her.
UNK: Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?
UNK: So, like, 3 percent of the time, they don't even work?
Ross : They should put that on the box!
Ross : -Evidently, they do. -What?!
UNK: Well, I'll be.
UNK: -I can't believe we're here. -You've gotta be kidding.
UNK: What?
UNK: Front Desk Clerk : As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
Monica : No! You have been screwing us all day!
Man : -Who are you? -We're you. Just 10 seconds later!
UNK: You already got the first-class tickets, the lounge. We should get free stuff too!
UNK: You're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Woman : You can have the suite if you want. We don't care about where we stay.
UNK: We're here to celebrate our love for each other.
UNK: We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
Chandler : We need the stuff.
UNK: Monica, it's Joey. Phoebe and I smell gas coming from your apartment.
UNK: -What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas. -What else is new?
UNK: -We'd check it out, but you took our keys. -Well, do something. Get in there!
Joey : -How? I guess I could break down your door. -Yeah, do that.
UNK: -And you won't blame us for any damage? -No.
UNK: -Are you doing it? I don't hear anything. -Okay, I'll break it down.
UNK: Hi. He's doing it, he's breaking down the door.
UNK: Okay, we're in.
Nurse : -Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable? -If I said I was, would you judge me?
