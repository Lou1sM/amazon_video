UNK: Hey. How you doing?
UNK: He has an amazing Porsche under there.
UNK: I'd love to show you, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping.
Joey : Would you two girls like to go for a drink?
UNK: - Is Rachel here? I'm her sister. - Oh, my God! Jill!
Jill : - Oh, my God! Rachel! - Oh, hi!
Chandler : - Oh, my God! Introduce us! - Well, this is Chandler.
Rachel : You know Monica and Ross. That's Phoebe. That's Joey.
UNK: - Hey, how you doing? - Don't!
UNK: You're a really nice guy. I'm happy to be your roommate and friend.
UNK: I'm just... You know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey : I see what happened.
Joey : It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Joey : Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine : - I don't think so. - Oh, I do.
UNK: How you doing?
Janine : I'm okay.
Joey : What? Oh, dear God!
Joey : Not much to tell there. I'm really shy.
UNK: So that's it. I guess that's all I need.
UNK: The Interviewer : Thank you so much. I think they'll run this next month.
Joey : Oh, great. Great. Thank you.
Monica : - Bye. - Bye-bye.
Joey : - I did it. - Amazing.
UNK: The Interviewer : Wait, I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this :
UNK: The Interviewer : Other than Days, what's your favorite soap opera?
UNK: Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me? I have a life, you know?
UNK: The Interviewer : The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to learn that.
UNK: Good enough.
Joey : So close.
UNK: They didn't put in the part about you not watching soaps.
UNK: I called the lady and said I was joking. She was nice about it.
UNK: - You slept with her, didn't you? - A little bit.
UNK: This picture of you is steamy.
UNK: That's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Ross : - Did you just wink at me? - You're the one who loves the picture.
