Phoebe : Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes.
UNK: Dude, are you trying to kill me?
Chandler : Well, I see you've had a very productive day.
UNK: - Isn't the cowboy hat a little much? - Come on, it's fun!
Joey : All right.
Chandler : Isn't this a woman's hat?
Joey : Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea.
Chandler : We have to turn off the porn.
UNK: I think you're right.
Chandler : - All right, ready? - One.
UNK: - Two, three. - Three.
UNK: That's kind of nice.
UNK: - It's kind of a relief. - Yeah.
Chandler : - You wanna see if we still have it? - Yeah.
UNK: Free porn! We have free porn here!
Joey : In my spare time, I read to the blind.
UNK: And I'm also a mento for kids.
Joey : - A mento? - You know, a mento. A role model.
Joey : - A mento? - Right.
UNK: The Interviewer : - Like the candy? - As a matter of fact, I do.
UNK: Our readers always want to know how soap stars stay in such great shape.
UNK: Do you have a fitness regime?
UNK: We stars usually just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
UNK: You know we've thrown this without dropping it for an hour?
Ross : Are you serious?
UNK: I realized it a half-hour ago, but I didn't want to jinx it.
Ross : - Wow, we are pretty good at this. - Yeah.
Ross : Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.
Joey : That's the first time I've ever missed a meal.
Joey : My pants are a little loose.
UNK: What's wrong with you?
Joey : I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights.
UNK: And then I passed out.
UNK: I haven't been able to stand up since. But I don't think it's serious.
Chandler : Sounds like a hernia. Go to the doctor.
Joey : No way!
UNK: If I go to the doctor, it's for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
UNK: Why'd I have to start working out again?
UNK: Damn you, fifteens!
UNK: - What is it? - A trifle. It has layers.
Rachel : A layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam.
Rachel : Then custard, which I made from scratch.
UNK: Then a little bit more custard.
Ross : It tastes like feet.
Joey : I like it.
Ross : - Are you kidding? - What's not to like? Custard, good.
UNK: Jam, good. Meat, good!
UNK: Well, you don't look good, Joe.
UNK: Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.
Joey : Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
Joey : Hey, what was in that brown jar?
UNK: - That's still in there? - Not anymore.
UNK: This piece doesn't have floor on it.
Chandler : - Stick to your side. - Hey, come on, now.
UNK: All right, what are we having?
UNK: I don't believe in these crazy diets. Just everything in moderation.
