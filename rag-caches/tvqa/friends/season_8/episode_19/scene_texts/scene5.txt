UNK: ...and damn it, I am a good friend. So shut up and close your eyes.
Joey : You are a good friend.
Joey : The audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.
Joey : But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Joey : Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
Joey : And they're off!
Phoebe : Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
UNK: Judge rules : No violation.
UNK: - The duck gets the Nutter Butter! - No! That's just an old won ton.
UNK: Judge rules : Nutter Butter!
Phoebe : Tough call.
UNK: - I saw it on the Discovery Channel. - Wait a minute. I saw that!
Ross : Yeah, about jellyfish, and how if you...
Ross : You peed on yourself?
UNK: You can't say that! You don't know!
UNK: I thought I'd pass out from the pain.
UNK: Anyway, I tried, but I couldn't bend that way.
UNK: So...
UNK: That's right, I stepped up!
UNK: She's my friend and she needed help!
Joey : If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you!
UNK: Nope. No best friend.
Joey : Just a lot of close friends.
UNK: So now back to the show.
UNK: The Interviewer : How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
Joey : Really? Me?
UNK: Wow, I don't even know any huge gay people.
Chandler : It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
UNK: Now, off the record, you're not...
Joey : What? Are you referring to my man's bag?
UNK: At first, it just looked good, but it's practical.
UNK: It's got compartments for stuff : Your wallet, your keys.
Ross : Your makeup.
Ross : Should I climb down your front so we're face to face...
Ross : ...or should I climb down your back so we're butt to face?
UNK: - I think face is best. - Yeah, face.
UNK: - Okay, here I come. - All right.
Joey : Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?
UNK: I prefer not to answer that. I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
UNK: When we said "face to face," we didn't think it all the way through!
Joey : - Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.
Phoebe : Check it out.
Joey : How much of a man am I?
Phoebe : Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.
UNK: You're turning into a woman.
UNK: No, I'm not! Why would you say that? That's just mean!
UNK: Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Joey : Not what you said, it's just the way you said it.
UNK: Oh, my God! I'm a woman!
Joey : - Great nap. - It really was.
Joey : Me? Gay? No. No. No.
Joey : But I have a number of close friends who are.
UNK: So let's talk about women.
UNK: I'm sure our female readers are interested in your romantic life.
UNK: What I do is, I look a woman up and down and I say :
UNK: "Hey. How you doing?"
Phoebe : Oh, please.
UNK: Hey. How you doing?
