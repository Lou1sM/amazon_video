UNK: You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will. Look, when you first came to the city..
UNK: you were a spoiled, helpless little girl who used Daddy's credit cards!
UNK: I hope you're going somewhere with this.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Look at you. You're this big executive.
UNK: You are more capable than you give yourself credit for.
UNK: I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
UNK: -Really? -I'm telling you.
Monica : Thank you.
UNK: All right. I'm gonna get going.
UNK: No, sweetheart, stay put.
UNK: I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here. Which I almost wasn't.
UNK: You're just so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
Phoebe : Nothing. You have apologized to her, like, a million times.
UNK: And she's been nothing but terrible to you.
Phoebe : You just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.
UNK: -And she hasn't even thanked you for it. -You know what? You're right.
UNK: If you wanna say anything, I'd tell her off.
UNK: Really?
Monica : Okay, I will.
Monica : Mrs. Green?
Monica : Mrs. Green?
Monica : It is rude to leave a party without saying goodbye to the host.
Monica : When someone apologizes to you, the decent thing to do is to accept it.
UNK: What I did wasn't on purpose.
UNK: But what you're doing to me now is plain spiteful.
UNK: -Spiteful? -That's right.
UNK: It's time you took a good look in the mirror, young lady!
Monica : Old lady!
UNK: Lady!
Phoebe : Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.
UNK: So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.
Monica : Good day.
UNK: I can't feel my legs!
Phoebe : You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you.
UNK: -Yeah? I'm proud of me too. -You should be.
Monica : -Could you get me something to drink? -You got it!
UNK: Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry! I apologize. If you..
Monica : Okay! I bit my tongue!
UNK: But I'm still really sorry!
UNK: -Okay, I'm ready. -You sure?
UNK: I've done my studying, and I know my stuff.
Ross : All right, then.
Ross : Rachel Green, let's play Bamboozled!
Ross : How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
Rachel : -Put your elbow in it. -Excellent!
Ross : -How do you put a baby down for a nap? -Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.
UNK: Correct!
UNK: There's a hopping bonus here, but I don't suggest you take it.
UNK: Okay.
Ross : This is an audio question. What do you do when a baby makes this sound :
UNK: Check if it's wet or hungry, burp it.
UNK: Excellent! Now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango Card?
Rachel : -A card! A card! I pick a card! -Oh, I'm sorry.
UNK: You've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother!
UNK: I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
UNK: Please don't walk away.
UNK: I've gone too far.
