UNK: We can lose to junior-high girls some other time.
UNK: All right. Let's play Bamboozled!
UNK: -Bamboozled? -Yeah. Isn't that a cool name?
UNK: -Yeah! -No!
UNK: All right. Okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller.
UNK: Tell us about yourself, Ross.
UNK: Well, I'm a paleontologist. I live in New York.
UNK: I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And..
Joey : I said, a little bit, Ross. How about you, Chandler?
UNK: I'm a headhunter. I hook up out-of-work Soviet scientists..
UNK: with rogue Third World nations. Hi, Rasputin.
UNK: Excellent! Let's play! Chandler, you'll go first.
UNK: -What is the capital of Colombia? -Bogota.
UNK: It's Bogota, but close enough.
Joey : You can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango Card.
Chandler : -What does a Wicked Wango Card do? -I should know that.
UNK: Let's see. One moment, please..
Joey : Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card determines if you go higher or lower.
Chandler : Higher or lower than what?
Joey : -This is embarrassing! -Can you believe how lame this is?
UNK: I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
UNK: I told the stripper to be here at 5. That's good, right?
Monica : You ordered a stripper for the shower? That is inappropriate.
UNK: Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.
Phoebe : Oh, hi, Mrs. Green. I'm so glad you could make it.
UNK: Thank you so much. We're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
UNK: Try.
UNK: There's my little girl!
UNK: -She's still mad. -Yeah, I know.
UNK: Isn't it great? One less person to make small talk with.
UNK: Hey, how are you?
UNK: Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
UNK: Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It doesn't bother you?
UNK: We've apologized twice. I can't do any more than that.
Phoebe : You hate it when people are mad at you..
Phoebe : but you just have to be okay with it.
Monica : Okay. I can do that.
Monica : -I gotta go powder my ass. -Oh.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school.
UNK: If I didn't know better, I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble.
UNK: -Come, let's get some tea. -Okay.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Oh, my! Look at that. Only three weeks to go.
UNK: Did you pick a nanny? If you use your housekeeper, it will split her focus.
UNK: Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny. And I don't have a housekeeper.
UNK: It's like you're a cave person.
UNK: You must get a nanny. You don't know how overwhelming it will be.
UNK: When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.
UNK: Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish.
Rachel : I actually think I remember some of it.
UNK: Tu madre esta loca.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Such a sweet woman.
UNK: And more important, she became a part of our family.
UNK: That's right, Mrs. K. What did that K stand for?
UNK: I have no idea, dear. She was the nanny.
UNK: As great as she was, I can't afford that.
UNK: I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget not everyone has alimony.
UNK: Mrs. Green : -Oh, Rachel! -What?
UNK: I just had a great idea! I'm gonna come live with you!
Rachel : What? What?
UNK: Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my little girl.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
Rachel : Yes, yes, I do.
UNK: Ross, you're in the lead.
