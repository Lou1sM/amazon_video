Rachel : -Why did you invite my mother? -What?
Rachel : She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Phoebe : -For how long? -Eight weeks.
Rachel : I love my mother, but, my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
UNK: I'd be honored if she wanted to live with me.
UNK: She can't hear you.
UNK: What am I gonna do?
UNK: If you don't want her to move in with you, just tell her.
UNK: You're right. I'm about to have a baby.
UNK: I can say I don't want her sleeping on my couch.
UNK: She'll wanna sleep in my bed. This can't happen.
Monica : That is right.
UNK: Tell her you don't want her to live with you.
Monica : Do not take no for an answer.
UNK: This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel!
UNK: And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
UNK: Oh, honey, you have to let it go.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Who doesn't accept an apology?
UNK: I mean, it's just so simple.
UNK: "I'm sorry, Sandra." "That's okay, Monica.
UNK: I forgive you.
UNK: And by the way, you're very pretty."
Phoebe : I have new respect for Chandler.
Phoebe : All right, everybody! It's time to open the presents!
UNK: Yes! The first gift that Rachel opens..
Monica : should be from the grandmother.
UNK: Because you're the most important person in this room! And in the world!
UNK: I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute.
UNK: But thank you so much, dear, for bringing that to everybody's attention.
Phoebe : How about you less important people? Let's open your presents!
UNK: -It's okay that you didn't get a gift. -I kind of did.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Me! Eight weeks of me.
Rachel : Okay. See, Mom, the truth is, I can do this on my own.
UNK: I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.
UNK: But you need help at the beginning.
UNK: I know what I'm doing. I can handle it.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Really? Remember Twinkles?
Rachel : He was a hamster. I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!
Phoebe : Okay, come on, Rach. It's present time!
UNK: You're the glue holding this party together.
UNK: It's kind of falling apart here.
UNK: Mrs. Green : -Oh, look! -Wow!
UNK: This is from your friends at work.
Rachel : Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow! Oh, I know what this is.
Monica : Wait a minute.
UNK: That can't be right.
Rachel : Is that a beer bong for a baby?
UNK: Darling, that's a breast pump.
Rachel : Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that.
UNK: Oh, wow! What's this?
UNK: -It's a Diaper Genie. -It dispenses clean diapers!
UNK: It's where you put dirty ones.
UNK: Why don't you take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
UNK: -You're gonna do that 10 times a day? -What, it goes 10 times a day?
Rachel : Are we feeding this baby Indian food?
UNK: No, dear. That's what babies do.
Monica : Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
UNK: What will you do with the baby while you trot out to the garbage?
UNK: I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table?
UNK: -What? What did I do? What did I do? -You can't leave a baby alone.
Rachel : Of course, I know that!
Rachel : Of course you never leave a baby alone.
Monica : It would.. She wouldn't be safe.
UNK: Not as safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy.
UNK: Opening the presents is a little overwhelming right now.
UNK: I'm gonna maybe open them all a little bit later.
UNK: Thank you for coming, for the gifts..
Rachel : -and this basket is beautiful. -It's actually a bassinet.
UNK: Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.
UNK: In what film would you hear this line : "We don't need no stinking badges!"
