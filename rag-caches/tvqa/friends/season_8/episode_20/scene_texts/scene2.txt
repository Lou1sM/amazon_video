Joey : Would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Ross : The Wheel has not been my friend tonight, Joey.
UNK: I'll take another question.
Joey : Okay. This is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
UNK: It's okay. I'm ready.
Joey : You gotta hold your breath until you answer.
UNK: This is ridiculous! He's not gonna hold his..
Joey : Okay. What do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia? Triska..
UNK: Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk..
UNK: Look at this. How do you say that?
Chandler : -Let me see that. -This one right here.
UNK: -Triskaidekaphobia. -Fear of Triscuits!
Joey : -No! No. Fear of the number 13. -Fear of Triscuits?
UNK: It's possible. They have really sharp edges.
UNK: Chandler, you're up.
UNK: I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn.
UNK: Yes, yes. But you can only use it once, so choose wisely.
UNK: This is tricky.
UNK: I mean, I am in the lead, but I would love another shot at the Golden Monkey.
Chandler : -This game makes no sense! -You're upset because you're losing.
Chandler : Oh, come on, Ross. I think we're all losers here.
UNK: I would like to hang on to my Angel Pass please.
Joey : You can either spin the Wheel or pick a Google Card.
Chandler : Let me think, let me think. Oh, I don't care.
Joey : You must choose.
Chandler : -Either. It makes no difference. -Choose, you jackass.
UNK: -I'll take a card. -You picked the Gimme Card!
UNK: -You get all of Ross' points! -What?
UNK: This game is kind of fun!
UNK: You don't think it's crazy that you get my points..?
UNK: The contestants aren't supposed to speak to each other.
UNK: Now, do you wanna start opening presents..
UNK: because it seems like people are getting itchy to leave.
UNK: And when I say people, I mean me.
