UNK: -Hi! -Hey!
UNK: So, what's the final head count on my baby shower?
UNK: About twenty. Couple people from work had something else to do.
UNK: Your sisters called and can't make it.
UNK: What? You mean they're not coming to a social event..
UNK: where there's no men and no booze? That's shocking.
UNK: I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
Monica : -Oh, my God. Your mother. -What? My mom's not gonna be here?
Monica : Well, given that we forgot to invite her, it would be a big coincidence if she was.
Monica : My God!
Monica : Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.
UNK: I don't have a mother. So often I forget..
Monica : Oh, give it a rest.
Rachel : So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?
UNK: No.
Phoebe : Neither is mine.
UNK: We'll take care of it. We'll call her. You go home and get ready.
Rachel : Make sure she comes. It's important. It's my mom.
UNK: -I know. What's her number? -I don't know.
Monica : Go. I have it in my book. Go.
UNK: If you're in charge of invitations, why am I calling her?
Monica : Hello, Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
UNK: Mrs. Green : -Oh, hello, Monica. -Hi.
UNK: It's last-minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu..
Monica : -baby shower for Rachel today. -My daughters told me..
UNK: Mrs. Green : when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
UNK: -Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -For what, dear?
UNK: Mrs. Green : For not inviting me, or for lying about it?
Monica : Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.
UNK: I'm sorry for everything. Really, I mean..
UNK: there's a lot of planning in a baby shower.
UNK: You know, things get overlooked and..
UNK: Phoebe's mother killed herself.
UNK: Why? Did you forget to invite her too?
UNK: Oh, you're so funny.
Monica : Please, please, can you come? It starts at 4 : 00.
UNK: -Well, all right. I'll see you at 4. -Thank you.
UNK: -Isn't it at 3? -Son of a bitch!
UNK: I can't go. I'm practicing. I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
UNK: -Cool! -Great!
Joey : If I get it, by day I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.
UNK: But by night I'll be Joey Tribbiani!
UNK: You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
Phoebe : I know. I know.
UNK: It'd be great if I got this because you never know what could happen on a soap.
UNK: But I could be a game-show host forever.
UNK: Like that Bob Barker guy. He's been doing The Price is Right for 75 years.
UNK: I bet the ratings weren't good for the first 25.
UNK: You know, before there was television.
UNK: But the problem, this game is really complicated.
UNK: Come on. You said the same thing about Hungry Hungry Hippos.
UNK: And last week, you beat Ben.
UNK: Yeah. I have to be honest with you guys.
UNK: He kind of let me win.
UNK: The audition's in a couple hours, and I don't understand the game.
Ross : Do you want some help?
UNK: Oh, really? That'd be great. Hey, you guys can be the contestants!
