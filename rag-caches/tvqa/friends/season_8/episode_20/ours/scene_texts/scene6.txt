Ross : I just Bamboozled Chandler!
UNK: Which is not a sexual thing.
UNK: -Well, that was a quick shower. -Not if you were here.
Ross : Looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
UNK: We did. My mom got us the greatest gift of all.
UNK: A Play-Doh Barbershop?
UNK: No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
UNK: What?
UNK: Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby!
UNK: You're not serious!
UNK: She's a very nice woman, but we can't take eight weeks of her.
UNK: -She'll drive us crazy.. -Hi, Ross!
UNK: Hey, roomie!
UNK: Hey, I'm Ray. I'm the producer of the show.
UNK: It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.
UNK: This is Duncan and Erin. They're gonna help with the audition.
UNK: -Right, Ray. -Whenever you're ready.
UNK: Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani. Let's play Bamboozled!
UNK: Erin, first question. In hockey, who is known as "The Great One"?
UNK: -Gretzky. -Correct!
UNK: Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card or spin the Wheel?
UNK: Didn't your agents give you the revised rules?
UNK: We've eliminated all that. No wheel. No cards.
UNK: Why?
UNK: It was too complicated. People didn't follow it.
UNK: Complicated?! Spin the Wheel to go up the Ladder of Chance..
Joey : through the Rainbow Ring to the Golden Monkey.
Joey : You yank his tail, and you're in Paradise Pond!
UNK: Yeah. All that's gone.
UNK: It's a simple question-and-answer game now.
UNK: Well, what's fun about that?
UNK: You expect me to host a boring game of people answering questions?
UNK: Women in bikinis hold up the scores.
UNK: Let's play Bamboozled!
UNK: So I thought we'd put the changing station in the living room.
UNK: I thought I'd bring in my decorator because I feel like I'm at my best..
UNK: when surrounded by jewel tones.
UNK: Sure, who doesn't?
UNK: Oh, and all those dinosaur knickknacks you have..
UNK: Mrs. Green : they might be more at home in the garage.
UNK: -Well, we don't have a garage. -Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
UNK: You know what? Maybe it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
UNK: Mrs. Green : -Well, Rachel needs help with the baby. -I really do. I don't know anything.
UNK: I'm sure that's not true.
Joey : Oh, no? Do I know anything about babies?
Phoebe : -No. Not a thing. -It's frightening.
UNK: Even if she doesn't know anything, I do.
UNK: And I'll be there to show her.
UNK: That's exactly what Rachel's father told me.
UNK: Know what he said at the first 3 a.m. feeding?
UNK: "I'm tired. You take care of it."
UNK: Which I later said to him when he wanted to have sex.
UNK: Well, I'm not Rachel's dad.
UNK: And no offense, but he's an ass.
UNK: I do like you, Ross.
UNK: I have a son. His mother and I didn't live together.
UNK: When he was with me, I took care of him all the time, by myself.
UNK: -That's true. You do have another child. -Yeah.
UNK: Mrs. Green : With another woman.
UNK: Mrs. Green : Have you no control, Ross?
UNK: That's a different issue.
Ross : The point is, when the baby comes, I will be there to feed her..
Ross : and bathe her and change her.
Ross : I want to do all those things.
UNK: -You don't need me to live with you. -Yes!
UNK: Yes. You're gonna be so missed.
UNK: -You'll be a great father. -You'll be a wonderful grandma.
UNK: Hello? I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
UNK: Every first-time mother feels that way.
