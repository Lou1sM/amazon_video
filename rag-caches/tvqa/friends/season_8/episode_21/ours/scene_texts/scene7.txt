UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
UNK: -You're back. -How are you?
UNK: I'm fine. But that's not important. What's important is how was she?
Ross : It was fun. We just had coffee.
Rachel : Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table?
UNK: What's going on? Do you not like Katie?
UNK: No. No, she was nice. I mean, she was a little slutty, but who isn't?
UNK: Well, I liked her.
UNK: Of course you did. You'd date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones.
UNK: Did you get a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?
UNK: No. It's just that.. Katie bothered me.
Ross : Why? What was wrong with her?
Rachel : There was nothing wrong with her. She was lovely.
UNK: -Okay. So, what's the matter? -I don't want you to date her.
UNK: Why? What, are you jealous?
Rachel : Yes. And not because I want you to go out with me.
UNK: Because I don't want you to go out with anybody.
UNK: It's terrible to even think this and it's inappropriate..
Rachel : but I want you to be at my constant beck and call, 24 hours a day.
UNK: I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
UNK: -Okay. -What?
UNK: I won't date. I'll..
UNK: I'll be here with you all the time.
UNK: Really?
UNK: But I'm being so unreasonable.
UNK: True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
Rachel : Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.
Ross : You feel better?
UNK: No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder..
Rachel : and now I have to pee.
UNK: -Okay. -Rach?
UNK: -Yeah? -Just one thing..
UNK: We live together. You're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else.
UNK: Are you sure you don't want something more?
UNK: Wow. I don't know, maybe..
UNK: Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.
UNK: -Like you did when I had to pee? -Oh! I knew that.
Rachel : I knew that! I was just messing with you too!
Ross : Okay. Because for a minute you seemed..
UNK: -No, it's just.. -Like you actually..
UNK: That's just because I'm such a good messer!
UNK: -Rach? -Yeah?
UNK: [scene : -The bathroom? -Right.
UNK: I had a great time. I learned how to bake, ate great food.
UNK: It's my first A since 7th grade and I didn't even sleep with the teacher.
Monica : -Oh, look. Acting for Beginners. -Yeah.
UNK: -Wanna feel good about yourself? -What the hell!
UNK: Let's start with some basics.
UNK: The Acting Teacher : Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
Joey : Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
