UNK: -Oh, no, no. -No, no.
UNK: -We're not married. -We are having a baby..
UNK: but we're not involved.
UNK: I mean, we were seeing each other a while ago..
Ross : but then we were just friends, and then there was one drunken night..
Ross : Or, yes, stranger, we'd like this delivered, please.
UNK: -Can you fill out this address card? -Oh, okay.
UNK: -You picked out a lot of dinosaurs. -Yeah.

Cashier : I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym around the corner.
UNK: -That's my gym. -I could tell you work out.
Cashier : A paleontologist who works out. You're like Indiana Jones.
Ross : I am like Indiana Jones.

UNK: Can you believe that?
UNK: -Did she know you two weren't married? -Yeah.
Phoebe : Oh, my God. Well, the idea.. A woman flirting with a single man?
Phoebe : -We must alert the church elders. -No.
UNK: You don't understand. You didn't see how brazen she was.

UNK: I just think it's wrong. I mean, here I am, about to pop..
