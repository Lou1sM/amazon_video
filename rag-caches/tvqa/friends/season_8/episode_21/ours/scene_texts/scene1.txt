Joey : This is bad. And I've had bad reviews.
UNK: I remember my first good one :
UNK: "Everything else in Our Town was terrible.
Joey : Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Monica : Oh, my God! Look at all the newspapers.
Monica : It must be a good review. Is it great?
Monica : Oh, dear God.
Ross : But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
UNK: -And the rest of Manhattan? -They all know.
Monica : Oh, my God, this is horrible. I'm so humiliated.
UNK: They say there's no such thing as bad press.
UNK: You don't think that "the mahi-mahi was awful-awful" is bad press?
UNK: I didn't write it.
UNK: -God, is he right? Am I awful? -Oh, no!
UNK: Monica, listen to me.
UNK: I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend.
UNK: Your food is abysmal!
Rachel : My due date is in one week!
Ross : -What are you doing up? -That is seven days.
Ross : I had a lot of water. Can we do this after..?
UNK: No, no, no, no, Ross!
UNK: We don't have any big stuff we need.
UNK: We don't have a changing table or a crib.
Rachel : -We do not have a diaper service. -Funny you should mention diapers.
UNK: -I'm serious. -There's nothing to worry about.
UNK: There's a baby store on West 10th. We'll go there..
UNK: -and get everything we need. Okay? -Okay. Thank you. That's great.
Rachel : Where on West 10th? There's a shoe store..
UNK: Okay. If you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna go do that, so..
UNK: -Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing. -Yeah.
UNK: Our situation, you know, what we mean to each other..
UNK: and, I mean, we're having this baby together and we live together..
UNK: Isn't that..? Isn't that weird?
UNK: Well..
UNK: I'm just kidding. You can go pee.
Joey : Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movie?
Monica : -We said at the movies, but.. -I'll see you there.
UNK: -Now that you're here..? -I'll hang out till I have to meet you.
UNK: -How come you're not going? -I've got a job interview.
Joey : -I thought you already have a job. -And they say you don't pay attention.
UNK: It's a better job. It's vice president of the company..
Chandler : that does data reconfiguration for other companies.
Joey : -Wow. How do you know how to do that? -That's what I do now.
Monica : -Joey? Come taste this. -What?
UNK: Remember the guy that gave me a bad review? Well..
UNK: I'm getting my revenge.
Joey : You cooked him?
UNK: No. He teaches a course at The New School..
UNK: I want to make him try my bouillabaisse again.
UNK: I can't wait to read the front page tomorrow :
UNK: "Restaurant reviewer admits : 'I was wrong about Monica.'"
Chandler : The front page?
Chandler : You really do live in your own little world, don't you?
UNK: -I better get to my movie. -Oh, yeah.
UNK: If I'm going to the movie and you're going to the movie..
UNK: why don't we just go together?
UNK: How's that for data reconfiguration, huh, Chand?
