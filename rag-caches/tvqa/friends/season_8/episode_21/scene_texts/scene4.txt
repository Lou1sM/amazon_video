UNK: The things you said were unfair..
UNK: and I want you to try my bouillabaisse again.
UNK: I don't see why I'd do that to myself again.
Joey : Either eat it or be in it.
UNK: Spoon?
Monica : -What do you think? -I'm torn..
UNK: The Food Critic : between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating.
UNK: The Food Critic : But I must be honest. Your soup is abysmal.
UNK: Thattagirl! We should get out of here, there's a new class coming in.
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : Welcome to Introduction to Cooking.
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : Can anyone tell me the difference between hollandaise and bearnaise sauce?
Joey : -I can. -Okay, go ahead.
UNK: Well, they both have a egg yolk and butter base.
Monica : But a bearnaise has shallots, chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.
UNK: Very good. What's your name?
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : -You go to the head of the class! -Okay!
Rachel : This stuff takes up a lot of room.
Rachel : How serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
Ross : My son? Pretty serious.
UNK: Hi, Katie. What are you doing here?
Katie : The delivery went out and they forgot this.
UNK: It must have been obvious, since it was the only thing left in your store.
Katie : Listen, to be honest, home deliveries aren't really part of my job description.
UNK: Oh, I actually came here to ask you out.
Ross : Oh. Wow. Yeah, that sounds great.
UNK: I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket and pretend that didn't happen.
UNK: I'm free now. You want to get coffee..?
UNK: -Sure. -Horny bitch.
UNK: No, you're a horny bitch! No, you're a horny bitch!
UNK: No, you're a horny bitch!
UNK: You guys have a good time.
UNK: I'm just gonna grab my coat. And my whip.
UNK: You know, because of Indiana Jones.
UNK: Not because I'm into S & M.
UNK: I'm not into anything weird, you know?
Ross : Just normal sex.
UNK: So I'm gonna grab my coat.
Rachel : So you had a good day, huh? Big commission, picked up a daddy.
Katie : Are you okay with this?
Rachel : Oh, yeah. Yeah, please. You guys have fun.
UNK: -Okay. -Yeah.
Katie : Nice to see you.
Rachel : Oh, and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic.
Rachel : -Although you missed a button. -Oh, actually, I..
Rachel : Oh, okay, I see what you're doing there.
UNK: I can't even believe this. I really come off that badly?
UNK: It's okay. You calm down after a while..
UNK: and then people see how wonderful you are.
UNK: Good. Because I'm sure this interview will last weeks.
UNK: All right, don't freak out, okay? I will help you.
Phoebe : -How long before you have to leave? -An hour.
UNK: -I can't help you. -Phoebe..
UNK: We'll do our best. I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time.
UNK: -Okay. -Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.
