Chandler : -Chandler Bing. -Oh, Bing.
Phoebe : -What an unusual name. -You should meet my Uncle Bada.
UNK: I'll let myself out.
UNK: Your alfredo's dry. Did you use your cheese?
UNK: When you say "use," do you mean "eat as a pre-cooking snack"?
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : -And the cream? -Cheese makes me thirsty.
UNK: -Okay. Let's move on. -All right.
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : Something smells good over at Monica's station.
UNK: My God! This is amazing! You've never made this before?
UNK: Oh, no. I don't know anything about cooking.
UNK: I had to ask what it was called when the water makes those bubbles.
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : -Hats off to the chef. -Your mouth was full. I didn't hear.
Monica : -Hats off to who? -The chef!
UNK: That's right!
UNK: You'll find that I don't micromanage. I don't shy away from delegating.
UNK: That's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do..
UNK: and focus on what you do do.
Chandler : What I do do..
UNK: is create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
UNK: Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.
UNK: -Hardest thing I've ever done. -Oh, you gotta go!
UNK: -Don't worry. You're ready. -Really?
Phoebe : Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts, and you'll be great.
UNK: Monica, check these out.
UNK: Those look like cookies.
UNK: I know, yeah. And I made them all by myself.
UNK: I mixed the ingredients, I put them in the oven, I took them out.
UNK: Granted, I should have used the oven mitts, but still.
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : Monica, my star student.
Monica : You called me that before, so I fashioned a star out of foil.
UNK: Now, no pressure. If you like my cookies, you give me the star.
Monica : Wow, a star!
Monica : I know you all hate me, and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
UNK: -Okay, Joey, you're up next. -Yeah.
UNK: Oh, my God! This is amazing!
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : You get an A.
UNK: I got an A? In school? Hey, I'm a dork!
UNK: Joey, I'm so proud of you.
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : -I think you should give him your star. -Excuse me?
UNK: -He doesn't know what he's doing. -Nobody knows what they're doing.
UNK: I do. I'm a professional chef!
UNK: Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.
UNK: Why are you taking Introduction to Cooking?
UNK: Yeah!
UNK: I'm sorry. I cook at this restaurant, Allessandro's..
UNK: and I just got a bad review.
UNK: -Allessandro's? I love that place! -You do?
UNK: You're a great chef. As a person you're a little..
UNK: -Oh, I'm crazy, but you liked the food? -Very much.
UNK: Okay, then. I don't stink. I'm a good chef! Okay.
UNK: I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
UNK: The Cooking Teacher : Did either of you pay for this class?
Joey : Hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go!
UNK: I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.
