UNK: -You must have had your hands full. -That I did. That I did.
UNK: So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
Chandler : My duties?
Phoebe : All right.
UNK: You'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.
Rachel : -I see. -But there'll be 30 people under you..
UNK: The Interviewer : so you can dump a certain amount on them.
Phoebe : -Good to know. -We could go into detail..
UNK: No, don't, I beg of you.
UNK: All right. We'll have a definite answer for you on Monday.
UNK: But I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
UNK: -Really? -Absolutely.
UNK: -You can relax. You did great. -Yeah, thanks.
Chandler : I was really nervous. I'm told I come on too strongly.
Chandler : And then it was really hard to sidestep that "duty" thing.
UNK: Duties?
UNK: Doodies?
UNK: Poo?
UNK: Poo?
UNK: Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay? The interview was over.
Chandler : That was the real Chandler Bing. This is some crazy guy.
UNK: Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
UNK: Poo?
UNK: I'll look forward to your call.
