Monica : -What are you supposed to be? -Remember the satellite, Sputnik?
UNK: Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"..
Ross : and these are my antenna.
Ross : So Sputnik becomes..?
UNK: Spud-nik!
UNK: Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore.
UNK: All right! Ross came as doodie.
UNK: -No, I'm not doodie. -No, space-doodie.
UNK: Okay, I'm Spud-nik.
UNK: -You know, like Sputnik. -What's a Sputnik, doodie-man?
UNK: Hey, sweetie.
UNK: -Aren't you gonna kiss me? -Okay.
UNK: But right after, you have to tell me who you are.
UNK: -Ursula? -Ursula's fiance?
UNK: You're the sister. I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
Eric : Is your mother here? I could slap her on the butt.
Phoebe : -My mother killed herself. -See, and I knew that.
UNK: Now I'm sweating.
UNK: I'm sweating. Now I'm saying look at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.
UNK: No. We'll start over.
UNK: -Hi, I'm Phoebe. -Eric.
Phoebe : -Why are you looking at me like that? -Sweat's burning my eyes.
Witch : -Thank you. -There.
Monica : -What are you? -There's no name for it.
UNK: I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.
UNK: -No, I meant your costume. -I'm a solar system.
UNK: My second graders helped.
Phoebe : -I love the second grade. -Really?
UNK: It's much better than first grade, and definitely better than third.
Phoebe : With all the politics and the mind games.
Eric : -So, what do you do? -I'm a masseuse, by day.
UNK: -You don't have to stand with me. -I'm having fun.
UNK: -I'm excited for you and Ursula. -I feel very lucky. She's great.
UNK: -She's the most beautiful woman ever. -Thank you.
Monica : -Hey, Joey? -Yeah?
Monica : -You read comic books, right? -Exclusively.
UNK: Who would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Joey : -Catwoman, hands down. -Yeah.
Joey : Between you and Phoebe? I'd give Phoebe the edge.
Monica : -What? Really? -You kidding?
Joey : Phoebe lived on the street, okay? Plus, she's got a crazy temper.
UNK: She's not right behind me, is she?
UNK: No, you're fine.
UNK: -Could I take Rachel? -I'm not sure.
Monica : What? Come on, I am tough!
UNK: Punch me here, as hard as you can!
UNK: Relax. Why are you so serious? It doesn't matter.
UNK: Really? What if I told you Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
Joey : I would say, "Woman, please."
UNK: Ursula's fiance is really sweet.
UNK: -You think you could take him? -The dude with the balls on his chest?
UNK: I think so.
UNK: But what is he doing with my sister? He's so great.
UNK: He's a teacher, he does volunteer work.
UNK: Normally, I don't like sweaty guys. But I could just mop him up.
