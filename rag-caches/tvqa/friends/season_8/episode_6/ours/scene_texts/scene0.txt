UNK: -Guys, guess what? -What?
UNK: We're having a Halloween party!
UNK: -Good! -Great!
UNK: -You have to wear a costume. -I can't make it.
UNK: Come on, it'll be fun.
UNK: I'll be there. I have to wear a costume to my classes that day anyway.
UNK: Tell me you're not gonna dress like a dinosaur.
Ross : Not two years in a row.
UNK: -I'll come, but I'm not dressing up. -You have to.
UNK: No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not.
UNK: You're an actor.
Monica : Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Ross : -I will. -The girl from the wedding?
UNK: If she needs costume ideas, she could be a bikini model..
Joey : or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader.
UNK: Or Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. No! Slutty Leatherface.
UNK: Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?
UNK: That's right, he was hitting on her.
Ross : And I got her. I guess the better man won.
UNK: Please don't take her from me.
