UNK: -You're going down. -Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!
Joey : Seriously, guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Rachel : Gunther, you brought candy. Thank you so much.
Rachel : -You are so sweet. -Really?
Rachel : You are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
UNK: -Got to go. -Trick or treat.
Rachel : Hi! Wow! There you go.
UNK: Boy In The Cape : My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
UNK: We were, but now we've got candy.
UNK: I'd rather have the money.
UNK: That's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
UNK: This isn't fair.
UNK: Is it fair that you put on a cape and get stuff?
UNK: Boy In The Cape : Shut up!
Rachel : You shut up!
UNK: -You can't tell me to shut up. -I think I just did.
UNK: And here it comes again. Shut up!
UNK: No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.
UNK: Wait, I had one more thing to say. Right. Shut up.
UNK: You're a mean old woman.
UNK: Wait! Shut.. Don't cry!
Rachel : Let me get my checkbook!
UNK: You don't have to do this. The strength inside you means the most.
UNK: You're loyal, you're honest and you have integrity.
UNK: That's the strength I want in a man.
UNK: That means nothing to me. Come on!
Phoebe : -Hi, liar. -Hey.
UNK: He's marrying you because he thinks the things you were saying were true.
Ursula : -They could be true. -But they're not.
UNK: It's a fine line.
Phoebe : -Why are you lying? -I don't know.
UNK: He did this stuff, I said I did it too. He got so excited, it was fun.
UNK: You can't do this. You're gonna ruin his life.
UNK: Why are you taking this so seriously? It's just a marriage.
UNK: Besides, if I cheat on him, I can call it an affair.
UNK: Honey?
UNK: It's a disgusting habit, and I want you to quit now!
UNK: She's helped so many people quit.
UNK: We'd better get going.
UNK: -You have a church group meeting. -Right.
Eric : -It was nice meeting you. -You too.
Phoebe : And, Ursula, it was really nice meeting you tonight!
UNK: Come on! Bunny versus doodie. We're waiting!
Joey : Okay, guys. One match, winner take all.
Joey : Wait. What does the winner get?
UNK: -Pride. -And dignity.
Joey : Okay, if you say so.
Joey : All right, ready, set, go!
Monica : -Come on! -Come on!
UNK: -Wow, they're both really strong. -Or equally weak.
UNK: Oh, God. Chandler's making his sex face.
UNK: -So you getting tired? -No. I could do this all day.
Ross : Yeah. Me too.
UNK: -Getting a little tired, though. -God, I'm exhausted.
UNK: This is starting to look bad for me, okay? Mona's standing right there.
UNK: She's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
Ross : Let me win. My wife thinks I'm a wimp.
Ross : At least you have a wife. I get divorces and knock people up.
UNK: And I'm dressed as doodie.
UNK: -You're Spud-nik. -Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.
UNK: Please? She's watching.
UNK: -Fine. -Thanks.
Chandler : -Oh, no. -Oh, yeah!
