Mona : My hero!
UNK: You're a weird lady.
Eric : Ursula said she left her purse.
UNK: What a relief. It has the numbers for her prayer chain.
UNK: I'm sure it does.
UNK: Guess I'll see you at the wedding.
UNK: I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding.
UNK: I wish you all the luck in the world.
UNK: And I also want to give you a little piece of advice..
UNK: that I give to everyone who's getting married.
UNK: Don't trust your wife.
UNK: I think we'll be okay.
UNK: It's so perfect, and she's been saving herself for me.
UNK: -I can't let you do this. She's lying. -What?
Phoebe : She is lying. And I bet I could prove it. Excuse me.
UNK: Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.
Phoebe : But what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.
UNK: Here's the name tag from where she works as a waitress.
Phoebe : Not a teacher, a waitress.
UNK: Here, she always lies about this.
Phoebe : -How old did she say she was? -She told me she was 25.
UNK: I almost don't want to show you.
UNK: Just remember, I'm a minute younger.
Eric : I am so stupid.
UNK: Of course she's not a teacher.
UNK: There's no such thing as a "Top Secret School for the Children of Spies."
UNK: No, you're not stupid.
UNK: I'm not smart.
Eric : I just wanted so much to be impulsive for once.
Eric : -To be romantic. -Good.
UNK: You should be impulsive and romantic. You did it with the wrong person.
UNK: -What? -It's weird, two people look so alike.
Eric : And so different.
UNK: Eric! Let's go!
UNK: -Better go deal with it. -Yeah, you should.
Ursula : Hurry up! I gotta pray!
Rachel : I had to give the kid 50 bucks to stop crying.
UNK: That's not bad.
UNK: I also had to go to a few houses as his girlfriend.
UNK: I am awful with children.
UNK: You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween.
UNK: They're all greedy, hopped up on sugar.
UNK: -That's all it is? -Absolutely.
Joey : Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas. And their birthdays.
UNK: They get crazy during the summer too.
UNK: And any time they're hungry or sleepy.
Joey : Kids are tough. Good luck with that.
UNK: Look, I'm sorry you lost.
UNK: I got a secret for you. I let him win.
UNK: Was that a secret, or a lie?
UNK: -No, I let him.. Ross? -Yeah?
Chandler : Would you tell her I let you win, please?
UNK: Chandler "let me win."
UNK: No, Chandler's really strong. My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?
UNK: I am strong. I'll show you.
Monica : Chandler, please.
UNK: What's the matter? Scared?
UNK: Let's go, big bunny!
UNK: One, two, three. Go!
UNK: I'm gonna kill myself!
