UNK: -It's a costume party. -So that's why you're..
UNK: No.
Phoebe : But thanks.
UNK: -You're supposed to wear a costume. -I am.
UNK: I am a woman who spent money on a dress she wants to wear..
UNK: because soon she won't fit into it.
UNK: I'm Catwoman, who wants the dress when you're too big for it.
Kids : -Trick or treat! -Can I give out candy?
UNK: I want to be with kids. Since I got pregnant, I have maternal instincts.
Kids : -Trick or treat! -Just a minute!
Rachel : Look at you guys!
Rachel : -Wow! You are a very scary witch. -Thank you.
Rachel : -And you are a very funny clown. -Thank you.
Rachel : And you..
Rachel : are so in style right now.
UNK: I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line has got this equestrian theme.
UNK: -Did you see the cover of Vogue..? -Could I just have the candy?
UNK: Sure.
Phoebe : Catwoman. So we meet again.
Monica : So we do, Supergirl.
UNK: It's me, Phoebe.
Chandler : Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
UNK: I appreciate the costume.
Rachel : You did this to him?
UNK: I thought he'd love it.
UNK: -He loves The Velveteen Rabbit. -That rabbit was brown and white.
UNK: It was pink, or no bunny at all.
Monica : No bunny at all. Always no bunny at all!
UNK: -You didn't dress up either? -Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.
Joey : Dude, what happened?
Chandler : How is that me?
UNK: I'm Chandler.
Phoebe : That is so you!
Chandler : -When have I ever done that? -When have I ever done that?
Kids : Trick or treat.
UNK: -You're the prettiest ballerina ever. -Thank you.
UNK: That deserves another candy.
Witch : Thank you.
Rachel : I have to say, that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.
Ballerina : I love you!
Rachel : Honey, here, take it all.
Rachel : Monica? We need more candy.
UNK: -There's only been four kids. -I know.
UNK: But one said she loved me, so I gave her everything.
UNK: No wonder you're pregnant.
