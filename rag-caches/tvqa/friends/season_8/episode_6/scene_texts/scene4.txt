Monica : -Oh, my God, Phoebe? -What?
UNK: -You're getting a crush on him. -No, I'm not, you are!
Joey : Here comes the temper.
Kids : Trick or treat.
UNK: Know what? We're out of candy. But someone went for more.
UNK: And I've been giving out money, but I'm out of that too.
Rachel : -Can I write you a check? -Okay.
UNK: -Okay. What's your name? -Lelani Mayolanofavich.
UNK: Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to "cash."
UNK: -Hi. -Hi, Mona.
UNK: Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.
UNK: Actually, I'm just a nurse.
UNK: You'd think that would embarrass me, but I'm maxed out.
Ross : -You made it. -Wait.
UNK: -You're a potato? -Well, I'm a spud..?
UNK: -And the antenna.. You're Spud-nik! -Yes!
Chandler : Marry her.
UNK: Here's a good one. Who'd win a fight between Ross and Chandler?
UNK: I can't answer that. Chandler's my husband.
Monica : -So Ross? -Yeah.
Eric : -Hey, beautiful. -Hello, handsome.
Phoebe : Oh, God.
Phoebe : Look at you two. When did you guys meet?
Eric : -Two weeks ago. -That's it?
Eric : I know. It sounds crazy, and I'm not impulsive, but..
Eric : -we have so much in common. -Oh, really?
UNK: We're both teachers.
Eric : -And we were both in the Peace Corps. -Peace Corps, really?
UNK: When we were building in Uruguay, we were two towns apart and never met.
UNK: Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left.
Ursula : -Shall we get me really drunk? -Sure.
UNK: Howdy, doodie.
UNK: That's funny, yeah.
UNK: You're the funniest man here in a bunny costume his wife made him wear.
UNK: Relax, man. You're looking a little flushed.
UNK: -Our question might get answered. -What question?
Joey : Who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
UNK: -There's no question. -So you think Ross too?
Chandler : -You picked Ross? -Ross is strong.
UNK: He's the strongest out of all three of you. Except for Joey.
UNK: -I can't believe you didn't pick me. -She's right. I am stronger.
Ross : I would destroy you.
UNK: Really? You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
UNK: I'll prove it like a theorem!
UNK: All right! Stop it!
UNK: Stop! No one's gonna fight.
Joey : People came to see a fight, let's give them one!
UNK: -You guys could arm-wrestle. -Listen to the slutty nurse.
