Ross : It was the chair again. Okay? I'm not doing it!
UNK: Dad. Can't you go back to your table?
UNK: No. Apparently little Molly Gilbert is enjoying her grown-up salmon en croute.
UNK: Look, I don't.. You know what?
Ross : -Would you like to dance? -Sure.
UNK: Great.
UNK: Little Girl : -Dr. Geller. -I wasn't farting!
Ross : A little game from our table.
UNK: Little Girl : Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Ross : Maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.
UNK: Unless this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.
UNK: I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.
UNK: Yes, I am.
UNK: In fact, let's try my special way. You can dance on my feet.
UNK: -Sure. -Yeah? Hop on.
Ross : Is the pretty lady looking? Keep dancing.
Chandler : And the world will never know.
Joey : Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Chandler : I told him how talented you were and all about Days of our Lives.
UNK: You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.
UNK: But you're not just a soap actor.
Chandler : You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
UNK: He has no idea what kind of range I have.
UNK: Don't move.
UNK: It's like he's running on tiny little pegs.
Rachel : -Thank you. -No, thank you, Miranda.
UNK: -Melinda. -All right.
Mona : -How cute was that? -Oh, were you watching?
UNK: Second Girl : Can I go next?
Ross : Of course you can. Hop on.
Mona : Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
Ross : -I am so gonna score. -What?
Ross : I like your bow.
UNK: I'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler..
Joey : the greatest couple in the world, and my best friends.
Joey : When I first found out they were getting married, I was a little angry.
UNK: I was like, "Why, God? Why? How can you take them away from me!"
Joey : But then I thought back over all our memories together. Some happy memories.
