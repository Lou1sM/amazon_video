UNK: -Come on, I love this song. You'll be fine. -No. No, I won't.
Chandler : Do you know why I took all those lessons?
UNK: I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor..
Chandler : with some clumsy idiot.
Monica : Oh, sweetie, you could never embarrass me.
UNK: Okay, you could easily embarrass me. But it doesn't matter, all right?
Monica : I married you.
UNK: No matter what you do, I'm gonna come home with you, okay?
UNK: So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on.
UNK: But I'll tell you, that's the last time I buy shoes at the Slippery Fun Shoe store.
Monica : Just try not to move your feet at all.
