Monica : Oh, sweet Lord.
UNK: I'm sorry, okay? I went down to the gift shop.
UNK: It was either this or a bathrobe. What's more important :
UNK: The way I'm dressed, or being with you today?
UNK: Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
UNK: I'm Ross, I don't believe we met. I'm Monica's older brother.
UNK: Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
Ross : Hello, Mona from her restaurant.
UNK: Mona. What a beautiful name.
Mona : You think so? I always kind of hated it.
Ross : Come on! Mona Lisa.
UNK: Mona...
UNK: Llegglachen.
Ross : The famous botanist.
UNK: Oh, no, she's.. Well, she's dead now, but..
Ross : Supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
UNK: Really?
Mona : -See, I never knew about her. -Linda Llegglachen..
UNK: So, what table are you at?
Ross : Me too.
UNK: Good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
Ross : Yes, there will.
UNK: Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've just been bumped up to table one.
UNK: And if it's all right with you, I'll take your place at table six.
UNK: Martin Llegglachen.
UNK: That's better. Now, just bend your arms a little bit. Now look straight ahead.
Joey : This time I want you to really put your ass into it.
UNK: Who's slippery now?
UNK: Isn't that just the best feeling? Rubbing a fork on the bottom of your shoe?
UNK: Mrs. Bing : Chandler, darling, look, my date has finally arrived.
UNK: I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips. Dennis, this is my son, Chandler.
UNK: -Congratulations. -Thank you.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : Dennis is a dear old friend..
UNK: Mrs. Bing : and a fantastic lover.
UNK: Are my ears bleeding?
UNK: Don't mind Chandler. He's always been shy.
UNK: Oh, you're right.
Chandler : Bravo, Dennis. Thanks for pleasing my mother so.
UNK: I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony. I was stuck at auditions.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : Yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
UNK: I don't believe we've met. Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : -Dennis Phillips. -I've admired your work for years.
UNK: -You've done some really amazing stuff. -Thank you.
UNK: If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink.
UNK: I'll be back in a moment.
UNK: Okay. You stop.
UNK: Dennis Phillips. That's great. How did you guys meet?
UNK: -Well, it's a funny story. -Funny, "ha-ha"? Or funny :
UNK: Thank you. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.
Ross : -I thought you were at table six. -No. Nine.
UNK: See, before, when you showed it to me, you held it that way..
Ross : which was misleading.
UNK: Hello.
Joey : Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?
UNK: Well, they've kind of locked themselves in one of the men's room stalls right now.
UNK: Perhaps when they get out.
UNK: If I could get in a Broadway show, then I would've done it all.
