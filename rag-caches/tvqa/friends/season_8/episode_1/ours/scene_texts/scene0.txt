UNK: Oh, my God, we did it!
UNK: We just got married. Right there!
UNK: Is that your ring?
UNK: We're off to a good start.
UNK: -And, you sure you're not pregnant? -Yeah. I'm sure.
UNK: But if you're ready to have kids we got a room upstairs.
UNK: I mean, I'll blow off this party right now. I'll do it!
UNK: Okay, you guys, that ceremony was so beautiful.
UNK: Was it?! Was it perfect?! Is it too soon to see the video?!
UNK: Can we just please take a moment? Our two best friends just got married.
UNK: We are so blessed to be able to share in this incredible joy.
UNK: That is so true.
UNK: Mon, is it too late to switch from chicken to steak?
UNK: I'm so happy for you guys. And you are both so lucky!
UNK: I mean, you both said the right names
UNK: And nobody was drunk.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: And nobody was gay.
UNK: And on your first try.
Joey : Oh, my God. Is that why you guys had to get married?
UNK: -Guys, I'm not pregnant. -Oh, slow swimmers?
Ross : What?! What do you mean? You're not pregnant?
UNK: -You didn't tell anybody I was, did you? -No.
UNK: I'll be right back.
UNK: You. Take a lot of pictures.
UNK: Why don't we get a shot of Monica and the bloody soldier.
Monica : About that, Joey, you have to change before the party.
UNK: -I can't. I don't have any other clothes here. -Find some, please.
UNK: Anything that doesn't say, "I died tragically in France."
UNK: -Fine! -And be careful who you hug, okay?
UNK: My father's upstairs in tears because you got blood on his dress.
UNK: Why don't we see the bride and the groom, and the bridesmaids.
UNK: Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys that you weren't pregnant?
UNK: -Because I'm not. -We found your tests.
UNK: If you're not pregnant..
UNK: it's because I am.
Chandler : What are you talking about?
UNK: Yes, I am with child.
UNK: I didn't want to say anything because it's your day.
UNK: -I didn't wanna steal your thunder. -So you told people I was pregnant?
Monica : Does this look like a conversation I want to remember?
UNK: -Who's the father? -Yeah.
UNK: I can't say.
UNK: -Why? -Why not?
UNK: I can't say because he's famous.
Rachel : Oh, my God. Who is it?
Monica : Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
UNK: Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.
Phoebe : James Brolin is the father of my baby.
UNK: As in Barbra Streisand's husband James Brolin?
UNK: What?!
Phoebe : Well, he never said that to me.
UNK: Monica, if you step away, we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.
UNK: How about just the bridesmaids?
Chandler : I am the groom. I was told it was a big deal.
Phoebe : -It is. -Yeah.
