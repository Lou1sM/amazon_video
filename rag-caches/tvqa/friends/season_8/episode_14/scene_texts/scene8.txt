Joey : -Do you have a bobby pin? -Yeah.
Chandler : Oh, no, wait. I'm not a 9-year-old girl.
Joey : Then why do you throw like one?
Chandler : -Maybe Monica has a bobby pin. -Oh, sure, "Monica."
UNK: So how's the inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
UNK: Really good. I should be ready to kill myself any day now.
UNK: Well, you sure found that quick.
UNK: I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel. I wish things could be normal.
Joey : I love living with her, and helping out with the baby is amazing.
UNK: But now I think Ross feels left out.
UNK: When I took Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father.
UNK: You should have seen the look on Ross' face.
UNK: I have no idea what I'm doing. For all I know, I'm locking it more.
Joey : -You try opening it with a credit card? -That's a good idea.
UNK: So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?
Joey : -I feel terrible. -It's not your fault.
Chandler : What are you gonna do, not take her? You're doing nothing wrong.
UNK: Except for harboring love for the woman carrying his baby.
UNK: Well, there is that.
UNK: Richard, if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
Monica : I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good.
