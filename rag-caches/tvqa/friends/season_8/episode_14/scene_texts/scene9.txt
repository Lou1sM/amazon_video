Phoebe : No, I got that.
UNK: -Can we make it a weekly appointment? -Okay.
Phoebe : You should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
UNK: -Okay. -I mean 500.
UNK: -What? -600.
UNK: What's going on?
Phoebe : You make sex noises when you get massaged.
UNK: It freaked me out. After a while, I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.
UNK: You're crazy. There's nothing sexual about the noises I make.
UNK: There's nothing sexual about this?
Monica : Oh, God!
Phoebe : What are you looking at?
Phoebe : I mean, hi.
UNK: Oh, that's why Alexandra wears earplugs when she gives me a massage.
UNK: It's not because she hates Enya.
UNK: This is embarrassing. I'm never getting a massage again.
UNK: Don't let this stop you from getting massages.
Phoebe : I have lots of clients that make those noises.
UNK: -Really? -Well, not clients. Lovers.
UNK: We'll try it again. Come back, and we'll work through it.
Joey : -You sure? -Yes.
Monica : -I guess. -Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.
Phoebe : So did you hear something you liked?
Rachel : Hey, Ross, check it out! I learned a new trick.
UNK: You know, if you stick one hand down your pants, you're the spitting image of Joey.
Ross : Hey, I brought you some lunch.
UNK: Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
Rachel : -Did you put pickles on this? -Well, yeah.
Ross : What? What? Rach, what?
UNK: -What's going on? -I made her tuna with pickle.
UNK: Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.
UNK: Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.
UNK: I'm sorry, I didn't know. You okay?
UNK: I'm fine, but someone make sure it's gone when I get out?
UNK: I'm on it!
UNK: I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.
Joey : -It could happen to anyone. -Not to you. You know this stuff.
UNK: I don't know any of it and I'm the father.
UNK: I wish I could be more involved, you know?
Rachel : Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Joey : Can I talk to you guys for a second?
UNK: -Yeah. -What's up?
Chandler : Sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Rachel : Are you breaking up with us?
Joey : The thing is..
UNK: because I live with Rachel, I'm here for a lot of stuff.
