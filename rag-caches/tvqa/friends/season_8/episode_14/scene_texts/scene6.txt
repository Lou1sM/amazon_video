Phoebe : -Are you under the sheet? -Yes.
UNK: Great, let's begin.
UNK: How's the pressure?
UNK: It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.
Phoebe : Stating the obvious, but thank you.
UNK: -And it's not weird, is it? -No.
UNK: That's right, you just enjoy.
Monica : Oh, yeah!
Monica : -Oh, yeah! -Okay.
Monica : Oh, God, Phoebe!
UNK: That's it! That's it, right there!
UNK: I wasn't trying to open your closet, I swear.
UNK: Monica runs a pretty tight ship here, doesn't she? What are you doing?
Chandler : Monica has a secret closet. She won't let me see it.
Joey : -Why not? -I don't know! What's she hiding?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: I bet it's Richard.
UNK: -What? -Before you say I'm wrong..
UNK: let me ask you something.
UNK: When was the last time you saw him?
UNK: Why would she keep Richard in here?
Joey : Off the top of my head..
UNK: maybe she's having her cake and eating it too.
UNK: You being the "cake," Richard being the "too."
UNK: -That was off the top of your head? -Yeah.
UNK: -Or.. -And here we go.
UNK: I saw a movie where there was a door. Nobody knew what was behind it.
Joey : When they finally got it open, millions of bugs came pouring out..
Joey : and they feasted on human flesh!
UNK: It wouldn't kill you to respect your wife's privacy!
Joey : Stupid closet full of bugs!
Rachel : Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't..
Joey : When my sisters were pregnant..
UNK: they got weird feelings and it was always nothing.
UNK: -Really? -Absolutely.
UNK: But we'll stop by the hospital just to be sure. I'll page Ross.
UNK: Rach, look at me. Everything's fine. Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.
Joey : Crushing bones!
UNK: Good thing we're going to a hospital.
UNK: -Open it. -Why'd you..
UNK: Watch your feet. There's bugs everywhere.
UNK: -So? -She's fine.
UNK: She had Braxton Hicks contractions. Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.
UNK: Mild discomfort? I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
UNK: -Everything's normal? -Yes.
UNK: -There's no danger? -No.
UNK: Dr. Long : Contractions can be unnerving, but she's fine.
Rachel : Thank you, doctor. And thank you for being nice and calm.
UNK: I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in my life.
UNK: -You said everything was okay. -What do I know? I'm not a doctor.
UNK: -But everything is okay. I'm fine. -You sure?
Rachel : Yes. I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus.
UNK: Dr. Long : Mild discomfort! What's he talking about?
Ross : -Is everything okay? -Yes.
UNK: Your page said, "Come to the hospital." What happened?
Joey : Something called Braxton Hicks contraction.
UNK: That's no big deal. Most women don't feel them.
Rachel : No uterus, no opinion.
UNK: What's with the candy?
UNK: I was at the concession stand at the movies.
Rachel : -You went to the movies by yourself? -Mona!
Rachel : -I gotta go back in there. -What's wrong?
Rachel : -I just gotta.. -No, really, tell me. What's up?
UNK: Look, I forgot my underwear.
UNK: Thanks for bringing her to the hospital.
UNK: Don't worry about it. No big deal.
UNK: But still, it should have been me. I'm the dad.
