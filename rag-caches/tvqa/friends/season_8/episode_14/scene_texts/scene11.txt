Joey : So, what do you think?
UNK: Living with the father of the baby. It's a little conventional for us.
UNK: Yeah, but hey, hey. You always have liked my building.
UNK: And there's more room. I mean, you could have a closet dedicated to shoes.
UNK: Oh, you do know your audience.
UNK: -I don't know. Is it crazy? -No.
Ross : Joey, this is a smart idea.
Joey : Well, I was due.
UNK: -Let's do it. -Really?
UNK: Rach, that's great. That's great.
UNK: And you know what? Don't worry about any of the moving.
UNK: I'll take care of everything. In fact, I'll start right now.
UNK: Ross, Ross. Mona?
UNK: Unbelievable.
UNK: Not too shabby. I got this all off myself..
UNK: using my wife's tools.
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
Monica : How did you get in there?
UNK: You're messy.
UNK: -No! You weren't supposed to see this! -I married Fred Sanford.
UNK: Chandler, you don't understand.
Ross : You know, how I organize everything, right?
UNK: Okay, well this is all of the stuff that doesn't fit into any category.
UNK: So you see, I'm not messy.
UNK: I'm just so organized that..
Monica : Okay, okay, fine! Now you know. I'm sick.
UNK: No, honey, you're not sick. I don't love you because you're organized.
Chandler : I love you in spite of that.
UNK: Really?
UNK: -Promise you won't tell anyone? -Yes.
UNK: Now that I know, if I've got extra stuff, can we share the closet?
UNK: Well.. It's just..
UNK: I'm afraid you might mess it up.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
UNK: So Rachel's all moved out? How you taking it?
Joey : I wanted to have a few beers..
Joey : but I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell.
Joey : I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium.
UNK: It's a couple weeks past its expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
Chandler : -Are you okay? -You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.
UNK: I'm better than great. I am good.
UNK: Now that she's gone, I can do stuff around here that I couldn't do before.
UNK: Like..
Joey : I can walk around naked again.
Monica : I can..
Joey : I can watch porn in the living room.
Joey : This is good for me.
Joey : I like being on my own. I'm better off this way.
UNK: I'm a lone wolf.
Joey : A loner. Alone.
Joey : All alone. Forever.
UNK: What's a wolf gotta do to get a hug around here?
UNK: That's it, just relax.
Phoebe : -Come on, more. -Oh, God!
UNK: You like that, don't you?
Monica : -Yeah, right there. -Want it there? Take it there, baby.
UNK: -Phoebe? -Yeah, say my name. Say it.
UNK: And now I'm going to cover you back up.
UNK: And I won't be speaking with you for several weeks.
