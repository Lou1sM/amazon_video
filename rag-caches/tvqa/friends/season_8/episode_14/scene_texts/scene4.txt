Phoebe : Oh, my God.
UNK: It's unbelievable!
Rachel : Wow, she is kicking so much. She's like..
UNK: Who's that annoying girl soccer player?
Joey : -Mia Hamm? -Mia Hamm!
UNK: -It's amazing. -One hand on the sheet, Joe.
UNK: Sorry.
Chandler : Hey, babe.
UNK: We got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?
UNK: Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under $6?
Chandler : -Maybe we can take it back. -Where would we return it?
Chandler : How about to the street, from the balcony?
UNK: We can't do that. What if they come by for a visit?
UNK: Let's cross that bridge when my aunt and uncle who I haven't seen in 15 years..
UNK: drop by unexpectedly and demand a giant bowl of punch.
UNK: Why don't we just find a place for it?
Chandler : In that cabinet?
UNK: That's for canned goods. Have you forgotten everything from orientation?
Chandler : How about the closet by the bathroom?
UNK: -Okay. Let me do it. -No, I'll do it.
UNK: You have to relax and let me take care of things once in a while.
UNK: It's locked. You have to help me. Why is it locked?
Monica : No reason. I keep private things in there.
UNK: I've been here a while, and I've never seen what's in there.
Chandler : What is in there?
Monica : Feminine stuff.
UNK: Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
UNK: Nothing in there concerns you. If you love me, you'll just let it go.
UNK: -Fine. -Thank you.
Rachel : Love you.
Phoebe : Hello, Chandler. Lovely day, huh? You.
UNK: If it helps, Alexandra's only been massaging her for three years.
UNK: If! I said, if it helps.
UNK: Why won't you let me massage you?
UNK: I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend. I'd be naked.
Phoebe : We lived together for years. I've seen you naked.
UNK: That's different. We were roommates. And when?
UNK: I'm curious about the human body.
Monica : You can understand why this would be weird.
UNK: I'm a professional and I'm really good.
UNK: If you're uncomfortable, we can stop. Give me a chance. Please?
Monica : If it means that much to you.
Phoebe : It does. How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking?
UNK: Or how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
UNK: -Dinosaurs. -Potato, potahto.
UNK: Ross, the baby's kicking.
Ross : What? It is?
UNK: It's not kicking now.
Rachel : Although we would love to see you do that again.
