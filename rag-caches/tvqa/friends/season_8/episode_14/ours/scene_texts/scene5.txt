UNK: When? What happened?
UNK: Last night. I went into Joey's room, and he was sleeping.
Joey : A dreamless sleep.
UNK: My God, the baby's kicking. That's great.
UNK: I wish I would have been there to feel the kicking for the first time.
UNK: I got some stuff going on if you want to feel.
UNK: I'll pass, but you look radiant.
UNK: I don't want to miss any more baby stuff. Here's my pager number.
UNK: Anytime anything pregnancy-related happens, use it.
UNK: I don't care if it's 3 a.m. and you want ice cream.
Joey : Can I get a copy of that?
