UNK: And Ross is missing everything. So..
UNK: Yeah?
Joey : You two should live together.
Rachel : Are you asking me to move? You don't want me here?
Joey : No, I love living with you. It just seems that..
UNK: if you're gonna have a roommate, it may as well be the father.
UNK: But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move in and disrupt his life.
Rachel : Or he does.
Ross : I would love to be around for you and the baby.
Ross : We can just try it, like on a temporary basis.
UNK: -But it's you and me. -It wouldn't be anything romantic.
UNK: I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!
Ross : I was supposed to meet her an hour ago. What is wrong with me?
