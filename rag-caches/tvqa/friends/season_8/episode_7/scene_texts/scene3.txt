UNK: I'll be back in a minute.
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : -See? I told you. -She stole my jeans!
UNK: What?
UNK: I've been looking for them all week, and she is wearing them.
Chandler : So she stole your pants and then came back and wore them in front of you?
UNK: Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
UNK: She must have been planning this for years!
Monica : I'll prove it to you, okay.
Monica : I dropped a pen in my lap, and it left an ink stain on the crotch.
Monica : When she comes back, I will find it and show you that stain!
UNK: Isn't it possible the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
Monica : I guess.
UNK: Shouldn't we give her the benefit of the doubt before we snoop around her crotch?
UNK: Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
Chandler : Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: -Hi. -Come in. I'm so glad you're here.
Phoebe : Yeah. Me too.
Phoebe : Not in the shaky, angry way that you are, though.
Eric : Sorry. I just saw Ursula. I had to get the engagement ring back.
Eric : Just seeing her brought it all back.
Eric : All the lies, the way she used me.
UNK: I just.. I get so angry, just looking at her..
UNK: -Face. -Yeah. Yeah.
UNK: I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you..
Eric : I see her.
UNK: And when I see her, I get a little bit angry.
UNK: So where do you wanna eat?
UNK: Not that I'm not enjoying watching you flip out.
UNK: Sorry.
Phoebe : -Maybe this is too weird. -Wait.
UNK: There's only a problem when I look at you.
Eric : I got it. I got it.
UNK: No, don't tear out your eyes!
Eric : -I was just gonna take out my lenses. -Oh, yeah. Try that.
Phoebe : So is that better?
Ross : Not really.
UNK: You're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're "Blursula."
Eric : Okay, wait. Maybe..
UNK: If I just don't look at you for a while.
UNK: See? It works. I'm not angry at all anymore. This is a great date!
UNK: Yeah, not so much.
UNK: It's kind of hard to have a conversation.
Monica : Oh, no. Sure, we can have a conversation.
UNK: Tell me a little something about yourself.
UNK: Oh, me?
Phoebe : Look, Eric, turn around.
UNK: I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. This is our first date.
Phoebe : First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and..
UNK: "He just touched my hand, did he mean to?" and first kisses..
Phoebe : Second kisses.
