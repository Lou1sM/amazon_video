Brenda : -What are you doing? -I'm leaning.
Chandler : This is where I lean.
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : -Brenda, a bee! -What?
UNK: It's flown into your blouse, and you better undo your buttons lest it sting you.
UNK: -I think I know what's going on here. -You do?
Brenda : Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian..
UNK: but it's wrong. You're married.
Chandler : -I totally understand. -Okay, good.
UNK: Could I just see your bra?
UNK: Hi.
UNK: -Where'd you get those jeans? -You gave them to me.
UNK: -No, I didn't! -All right, I took them.
Rachel : I figured it'd be okay because you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.
Monica : -Oh, no! Did you take my bra too? -What bra?
Monica : -The pink one with the flowers. -You mean the one you're wearing?
Brenda : I quit!
Monica : Sounds about right.
Rachel : What is this?
Joey : This is just to give you an idea.
Joey : We can put screens here so that the baby has privacy..
Joey : and maybe a mobile over the crib..
UNK: and here's a baby monitor which, till the baby comes, we can use as walkie-talkies.
UNK: You're so sweet!
Monica : Oh, my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
UNK: That's really just to show where the baby would go.
UNK: Why don't I hold on to him so there's no confusion.
UNK: Joey, the baby is gonna be crying. It's gonna be loud.
UNK: -I'm loud. -It's gonna be up all night.
UNK: -I'm up all night. -It's gonna poop.
UNK: Hello!
Rachel : What about all the women?
UNK: If I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand a baby..
UNK: then maybe I don't wanna be with that woman.
UNK: Or maybe we'll do it in the bathroom of the club!
UNK: But I won't say stuff like that around the baby.
Rachel : Joey, are you sure?
UNK: Yeah. Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay..
UNK: but it'll also be really, really great.
Joey : Please, Rachel, I really want you to stay.
UNK: I want me to stay too. Thank you.
UNK: -Joey, look at this crib. It's so cute. -I know. I found it on the street.
UNK: Are you..? Really? This is in such good condition.
UNK: Whoa! What's under the cover?
UNK: -I don't know. -It's moving.
UNK: It's got a tail! Get it out of here!
UNK: Okay!
Ross : Well, the old lady died. And how do I know?
UNK: Because her dying wish was for one last kiss.
UNK: And because I'm such a strong, strapping alleenstaande..
UNK: I had to carry her body to the lobby.
UNK: You know, and she was not a slight woman.
UNK: But I don't care, because you got the apartment. Yes!
UNK: Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.
UNK: Isn't that great?
UNK: What..? You.. But.. Bu..
