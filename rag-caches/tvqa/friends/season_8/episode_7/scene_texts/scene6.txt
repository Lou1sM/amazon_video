UNK: That's a fair question.
UNK: Well, my head was between your legs..
UNK: because I find you very attractive.
UNK: Are you coming onto me?
UNK: Apparently.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
Rachel : -How was the game? -It was okay. I ate way too much.
UNK: I was talking to Ross, and he said you were looking for a new place.
Rachel : Yeah. Hopefully across the street. If certain Dutch people would just let go.
UNK: I was kind of hoping you'd stay.
Rachel : Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
UNK: No room? It's a baby. It's, like, this big.
Joey : You could put it over here.
Joey : Or we could put it right here. It's cute, right?
UNK: Or put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it.
UNK: "Where's the baby?" "Oh, it's right over.."
UNK: Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it.
Rachel : A baby changes everything. They cry all the time.
Rachel : Imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score with a screaming baby.
Joey : I could use a challenge. It's getting pretty easy.
UNK: It's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I can't.
Rachel : It would disrupt your entire life.
UNK: It's just.. I love living with you so much.
UNK: -I wish things didn't have to change. -I know.
UNK: You know, I blame Ross for this.
Rachel : I do too, a little bit.
UNK: I'm gonna miss you.
UNK: You're the hottest roommate I ever had.
Phoebe : Oh, no, I have to go. I have a massage appointment.
UNK: No, stay here. We'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.
UNK: No, I've gotten in trouble for that before.
UNK: -I'll see you later? -Absolutely.
Eric : I love the way you kiss.
UNK: Really? That's the thing I'm worst at! You'll see.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: -Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise. -How come?
Monica : Because I put my head between her legs.
Chandler : -To see her pants? -They're my pants!
Chandler : Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
UNK: No. I was getting into position, and then everything went dark.
Chandler : She is not stealing from us, okay. Will you let this go?
UNK: Fine.
UNK: -She's wearing my bra! -Oh, dear God!
Monica : My pink, flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
UNK: Yet you don't recognize that you're crazy?
UNK: Here's the plan. I'm going to leave, and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.
UNK: Here's another plan. No.
Monica : I would do it, but she thinks I'm attracted to her.
UNK: -Why? -Did you not hear where my head was?
UNK: We're a team. We're in this together.
Chandler : I fear a jury will see it the same way.
UNK: Do this for me. I catch you looking at women's breasts all the time.
Chandler : You see that?
Monica : Do you see this?
Chandler : All right, yes. Okay. I get your point.
UNK: But if it's not her bra, will you just let the woman clean?
UNK: Yes. You'll know it's mine because on the right cup, there's a very noticeable rip.
Chandler : You need new clothes.
Ross : -Hi. How is she? -It's not looking good.
