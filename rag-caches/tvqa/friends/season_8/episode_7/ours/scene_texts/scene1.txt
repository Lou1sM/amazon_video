UNK: Yes?
UNK: Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
UNK: And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Ross : I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away, and I am so sorry for your loss.
UNK: -She didn't pass away. -What?
UNK: -My mother's still alive. -Oh, thank God!
UNK: Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter : It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she's a tough old bird.
UNK: Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter : Are you close with her?
UNK: Of course. She and I would talk all the time..
UNK: in the laundry room.
UNK: You speak Dutch?
UNK: You know, I would, but it's just too painful.
UNK: So she's really not dead.
UNK: No. She's hanging in there.
UNK: Could you tell me, is she hanging in in a one-bedroom or a two?
