Monica : Oh, my God, you cleaned! Look at these floors!
UNK: You did the windows! I have been begging you for months! And you did, you cleaned.
Monica : -And nagging works! -No, I didn't actually do this.
Monica : Oh, no. Was I cleaning in my sleep again?
UNK: No, it wasn't you.
Monica : -Well, then, who? -I got a maid. Yay!
UNK: I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress" because if some other woman was cleaning..
UNK: Now, honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control.
UNK: "Relinquish" is just a fancy word for "lose."
UNK: She's nice, and she mentioned that she adored the way you arranged the sponges.
Monica : Did she really say that?
UNK: Yes, I distinctly remember because I thought it was a joke.
Chandler : -Now, just give her a chance, okay? -Fine, I can do it.
UNK: -What's the matter? -Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.
Phoebe : I never get calls!
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween party. Ursula's fiance.
Phoebe : Oh, my God, Eric, hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
UNK: I have a friend who's a cop, and he got it for me.
Phoebe : Wow. What an incredible violation and wonderful surprise!
UNK: Listen, I just.. I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
Phoebe : Oh, you did? He did it, he did it!
Rachel : -What did he do? -I'm talking!
Eric : Anyway, I was wondering if you were the sort of person who eats lunch?
Phoebe : Are you asking me out?
UNK: Because it'd be kind of weird since you just broke up with my sister.
UNK: Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.
UNK: No, no. Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person.
Phoebe : Fight for me.
UNK: I won't take "no" for an answer.
Phoebe : Not great, but we can work on it at lunch.
Phoebe : I can be at your apartment in two hours.
UNK: Great. How do you know where I live?
UNK: I've got friends too.
Phoebe : Okay, bye.
UNK: Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!
Phoebe : This day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be.
UNK: Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.
UNK: So apparently I'm available for lunch.
UNK: I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
UNK: You're moving?
UNK: I can't live with Joey once the baby comes.
UNK: I don't want my child's first words to be, "How you doing?"
UNK: So does Joey know you're moving?
UNK: I haven't discussed it with him, but I know he'll be relieved.
Rachel : Last week, he brought this girl over, and I talked to her about morning sickness.
Rachel : Then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
UNK: -That's not really porn? -Not so much.
UNK: I heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Rachel : Oh, my God. Was she old? Does she have a view?
UNK: I don't know, but how great would that be? You living in my building?
UNK: I could take care of the baby, I could come over whenever I want..
Ross : with your permission.
UNK: That really would be great. Well, can we see it?
UNK: Maybe we shouldn't. I mean, if she just died this morning.
UNK: Yeah. No. No, you're right.
Rachel : -Shall we? -Yeah.
