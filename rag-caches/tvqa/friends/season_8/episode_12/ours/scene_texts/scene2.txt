Joey : I'd like to meet him. He sounds like a standup guy.
UNK: He's protective of me, so you'd better watch yourself.
UNK: Your roommate, is he good-looking?
Joey : Must be tough to keep your hands off him.
UNK: I'm pretty sure he's gay.

UNK: I'm sorry, I couldn't even get through that.
UNK: I knew it. Tell me your moves.
Monica : All right.
UNK: Well..
UNK: I start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Rachel : Oh, my God. And that works?
UNK: If you add, "This is embarrassing. I just want to have a normal life."
Rachel : You poor little famous man.
Joey : Okay, how about this one?
Joey : I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you..
UNK: but you're just so beautiful, I don't think I can.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Rachel : Wow, that was fantastic! I almost leaned in. Really.
Joey : So tell me one of your moves.
