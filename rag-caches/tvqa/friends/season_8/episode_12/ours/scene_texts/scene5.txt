Monica : All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.
UNK: Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?!
Phoebe : Hey, you guys?
UNK: I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before.
UNK: But if you don't get off soon, I will cut you.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials.
UNK: They're all Chandler.
UNK: Chandler couldn't get this good.
UNK: I did. But it came at a price.
UNK: Ben's coming, and he can't see this.
UNK: By age 7, kids have already seen orgies.
Chandler : Was it just me?
UNK: So..
UNK: we're about out of time.
UNK: Now, I know I've given you a lot of new information.
