UNK: Did we get paper towels?
UNK: You mean the thing we went to the store for?
UNK: Nope.
Phoebe : Hey, I got you a present!
Chandler : Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?
UNK: I ordered it for your wedding and it's finally here!
UNK: You didn't have to get us anything..
UNK: I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!
UNK: -It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine! -Oh, my God!
UNK: I didn't know where to put it.
Monica : -We can put it in the guest bedroom. -Yeah, okay.
UNK: I kind of like it here.
UNK: Do you like it?
Monica : I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade.
UNK: -This was my second favorite. -What's your first?
UNK: -I don't remember the name. -Well, what did it do?
UNK: You'd put a quarter in, pull some handles and win a candy bar.
Chandler : A vending machine?
UNK: Don't feel bad for me. I won every time!
UNK: Professor Newman, the department head, is retiring, so..
Rachel : -They made you head of the department! -I'm teaching his advanced class!
UNK: Why didn't I get head of the department?
UNK: Great. You've always wanted to teach an advanced class.
UNK: No, I know. It's really exciting. This is the break I've been waiting for.
UNK: I'm not sure a court-ordered detox program..
UNK: was the break Professor Newman was waiting for.
UNK: But, hey.
UNK: Hey, Rach, I got a big date. Do you know a good restaurant?
UNK: Paul's Cafe. It's got great food and it's really romantic.
Joey : Great, thanks.
UNK: Then take her to the Four Seasons for drinks.
UNK: Or go downtown and listen to some jazz.
UNK: Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!
Joey : You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex.
UNK: I miss dating. Dressing up, going to a fancy restaurant.
UNK: I won't be able to do that for so long. And it's so much fun.
UNK: Not that sitting around worrying about giving birth isn't fun.
UNK: Hey, you know what? Why don't I take you out.
UNK: You don't want to date a pregnant lady.
UNK: Yes, I do. We're gonna have a good time.
UNK: I'll take your mind off of childbirth, and C-sections..
UNK: and baby heads stretching out..
UNK: Okay, I'll go with you.
UNK: -It will be fun. -All right.
Phoebe : No, no! Yes!
Phoebe : Would you look at that.
UNK: I knocked off all your top scores. How sad.
UNK: Okay, I'm next.
UNK: Don't start another game. I'm next! Phoebe?
UNK: Sorry, I couldn't hear you over all the winning.
UNK: -Phoebe's hogging the game. -It's a stupid game.
UNK: You think it's stupid because you suck.
UNK: I don't suck. It sucks.
Monica : You suck.
Phoebe : If this game is gonna cause problems, I should keep it.
Monica : No, I love it. It is a great present.
UNK: Why don't you go home and wait for the thank-you card?
Chandler : -Why do you want to play this game? -It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.
UNK: Okay. Phoebe, that's it. Out of the chair.
UNK: Phoebe! Chandler!
UNK: No, no. This is a girl fight. I'm hoping it will turn into love-play.
UNK: Okay, look. Honey, I'm sorry..
UNK: I'm acting hostile. I don't mean to. It's just that I love this game so much..
UNK: that I would just like the chance to play it too.
UNK: Wow, it's amazing how well I can play with you yapping around my head..
UNK: like a Chihuahua.
UNK: All right, that's it. Chandler, help me get her out of the chair.
UNK: Chandler, come on.
