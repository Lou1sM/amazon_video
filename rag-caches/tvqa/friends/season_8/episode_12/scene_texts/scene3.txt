UNK: I don't know. There's just this distance.
UNK: We both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
UNK: It's gotta be rough.
UNK: Yeah, it's really tough. Sometimes I think..
UNK: Wow!
Joey : Nice move!
UNK: -"Where'd you grow up?" So simple. -Thank you.
UNK: Now, excuse me. I'm gonna use the restroom.
UNK: -Now you're watching me walk away. -Yes, I am! So simple!
UNK: -You won't believe what I did today. -Clearly not shower or shave.
UNK: I played this all day, and now I rule.
Chandler : They should change the name to "Ms. Chandler."
UNK: Although, I hope they don't.
UNK: You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went to work like a chump?
UNK: I got the top 10 scores. I erased Phoebe off the board. High-five!
Monica : What is the matter with your hand?
UNK: I played for eight hours.
UNK: It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.
Chandler : Also, look at the initials. They're dirty words.
Monica : -Chandler, why would you do that? -Because it's awesome.
UNK: You think it's clever?
Chandler : They only give you three letters, so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.
UNK: But clearly you're up to the task.
UNK: -This one's not dirty. -Put it together with that one.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: If you don't clear this off, you won't get one of those from me.
UNK: Ben's coming over tomorrow. This can't be there.
UNK: -He won't know what they mean. -He's 7, not stupid.
Chandler : -Have you talked to him lately? -I'm gonna unplug it.
UNK: I'll have nothing to show for my day. Like work.
UNK: No!
UNK: Hey, look! It's still there!
Chandler : This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM chip!
UNK: Wow. The dirty words and the computer talk.
UNK: This is just the coolest you've ever been.
UNK: -You gotta beat your scores. -With the claw?
UNK: Fine, I'll do it. We gotta get this off.
UNK: Carol's still upset that you taught him "Pull my finger."
UNK: Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!
Rachel : -I am not gonna answer that. -Oh, come on. Just pick one.
Joey : Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Ross..
Joey : if you had to, who would you punch?
UNK: We're friends. I wouldn't punch any of them.
UNK: Chandler?
UNK: Yeah, but I don't know why.
UNK: -I'm having a wonderful time! -Me too!
Joey : -This is the best date I ever had. -I know!
