UNK: I laughed so hard. Did you see the wine come out my nose?
UNK: Joey, I think everybody saw it.
Joey : I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of a date so much.
UNK: That's because you have never been on a date with me before.
UNK: All right. Now don't judge me.
UNK: I normally wait till my date leaves, but I'm ripping into the swan.
UNK: Okay, then you don't judge me.
UNK: I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from that brownie.
Joey : Oh, yeah.
UNK: So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end-of-the-night moves?
Joey : Well, if I want the girl to kiss me..
UNK: first, I make my lips look irresistible.
UNK: How do you do it?
UNK: Now you can't tell anyone, but..
Joey : I put on shiny lip balm.
Monica : -Oh, my God. -Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.
UNK: -Okay, now you go. -No, I don't want to tell you.
Rachel : -Why not? -It's embarrassing.
Joey : More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?
UNK: I didn't say raspberry before, did I?
Joey : Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
UNK: Okay.
Rachel : All right, stand up.
UNK: Well, when we're at the door..
Rachel : I lightly press my lips against his.
Rachel : Then move into his body, just for a second.
UNK: And then I make this sound :
UNK: It doesn't sound like anything, but it works.
UNK: Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.
Rachel : All right, I gotta go to bed. I had such a wonderful time.
Joey : Me too.
Rachel : You were 50 minutes late? Did you crawl?
UNK: No, I ran, okay? It's really far.
Ross : When did people stop understanding "Get out of my way"?
UNK: Why didn't you take a cab?
UNK: With the traffic and one-way streets, it'd take me twice as long.
UNK: And I have class three times a week. Who am I, Rockefeller?
UNK: You won't be able to keep doing this.
UNK: If I don't, they'll take the class away from me.
UNK: And I put it in my family newsletter.
UNK: -Your what? -You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.
Rachel : Right. Wow.
UNK: I figured out a faster route. I'm sure I can make it this time.
UNK: I just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.
UNK: -Hey. -Hi!
UNK: Remember when we talked about Cujo?
UNK: I can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.
UNK: Relax, it isn't Citizen Kane.
UNK: Have you ever sat through Citizen Kane?
UNK: Yeah, it's really boring. But it's, like, a big deal.
Rachel : Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo.
UNK: Well, let's do it tonight.
UNK: -Don't you have that big date? -Oh, right.
Rachel : -Hey, Joey, can I ask you something? -Yeah.
UNK: After our date, did you feel weird?
Joey : Oh, my God. You did too? It freaked me out. What was that?
UNK: I don't know. I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.
UNK: Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.
Rachel : -I was up sick all night. -Me too. All night.
UNK: Really? We didn't cross paths.
UNK: Yeah, well, that's because..
Joey : I stayed in my room.
UNK: You don't want to look in my hamper.
Monica : Okay, I got that.
UNK: I'll escape there. I'll come back here.
