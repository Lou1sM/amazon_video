UNK: Phoebe. Will you check out that guy by the window. Wow!
UNK: That guy back there? He's awfully short. And I think he's talking to himself.
Phoebe : And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
UNK: Really?
Rachel : What is wrong with me lately? It's like, every guy I see.
UNK: I mean, look at that guy, for example.
UNK: That's not someone I would be attracted to.
Rachel : But right now, with the way I'm feeling..
Rachel : all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Phoebe : Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
UNK: -Yeah. -This is completely normal.
Phoebe : Around the fourth month, your hormones start going crazy.
Rachel : -Really? So this has happened to you? -Absolutely!
Phoebe : And keep in mind now, I was carrying triplets.
UNK: So in medical terms, I was thrice as randy.
Rachel : Wow, this explains so much!
Rachel : Last weekend, I went from store to store, sitting on Santas' laps.
Phoebe : Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout..
Phoebe : of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
UNK: Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow. I'll ask her about this.
Rachel : Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
UNK: Yeah, that's what you need. A good pill.
UNK: Oh, no. Short, crazy guy recognizes me. Worst mistake of my life.
Mona : Call me.
Joey : Ordinarily, I would love to, but I am just swamped right now.
UNK: Where are the pictures that that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Mona : Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.
UNK: Oh, my God! All he took were pictures of my breasts.
UNK: I'm missing picture time!
UNK: You know, she has a face, Ross.
UNK: I didn't take these, okay? I didn't even know my camera had a zoom lens.
UNK: "Comma, officer."
UNK: -Okay, here's a good one of us. -Wow, that is a good one!
UNK: It looks like a holiday card.
Ross : With the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
UNK: Good job, pretzel pervert.
UNK: Every year, I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.
Ross : Do you want to send this one out together?
UNK: Together? Like, to people?
UNK: Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona and Ross." It'll be cute, okay?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: -I gotta get to work. Call me later? -Sure, sure.
Mona : -Bye, guys. -Bye.
Joey : Congratulations! You just got married!
Ross : I know. Can you believe that?
UNK: I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
Ross : Married couples send out cards. Families send out cards.
Ross : People who have been dating for a couple of months don't send out cards.
Ross : -What is she, crazy? -That's your wife you're talking about!
UNK: No, really. I mean, that would be like a huge step forward.
UNK: I like things just the way they are.
UNK: I'm finally in a relationship that's not moving too fast.
UNK: You know, ordinarily, I'd be divorced by now.
UNK: Okay, so just tell her you don't wanna send out the card. What's she gonna do?
UNK: This.
UNK: Oh, okay. I didn't mean to put pressure on you..
UNK: I just thought it would be something fun for us to do together..
UNK: but okay, that's okay.
UNK: Okay, stop. Stop. You're right, it's not that big a deal. I'll do the card.
UNK: -What? I said I'd do it. -I know, it's just..
UNK: Can I have $20?
UNK: -Hi. You ready for lunch? -One second.
