Doug : Unless you call turning into her mother "work."
Doug : Fine. Tomorrow night then.
UNK: -Tomorrow's no good for her, either. -Why not?
UNK: It's the semifinals..
UNK: of her bocce ball tournament.
UNK: Okay. The night after that then.
UNK: Well, that's the finals, and I think she's gonna go all the way, sir.
UNK: What's going on, Bing? Does your wife have a problem with me or something?
UNK: Well, now you're just talking crazy.
UNK: Then why can't the three of us go out together?
UNK: Because we split up.
Chandler : Monica and I split up.
Chandler : Hold me.
UNK: Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say I'm altogether surprised.
Doug : I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
Doug : And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
Chandler : What would really help me through this tough time is choking someone.
UNK: I know how you feel. Oh, yeah.
UNK: I know what it's like to give a woman all your love..
UNK: and then have that love thrown back in your face.
UNK: And then the court decides to give you custody of those fat, left-handed twins.
UNK: Well, they're lucky to have you, sir.
Doug : Bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.
UNK: Here's the plan : Grab your coat, we're going to a strip club!
Chandler : Oh, no! Monica would freak.
Chandler : But to hell with that bitch!
Ross : Here we go.
