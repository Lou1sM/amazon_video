UNK: -Okay, now he's cute, right? -Oh, God, yes.
UNK: So, how's it going?
UNK: It's going really good. But enough about me! Come on.
Rachel : Where are you from? What do you do?
UNK: -I'm a doctor. -Right. I meant..
Rachel : in your spare time. Do you cook? So you ski?
UNK: Or just hang out with your wife, or girlfriend?
UNK: I don't have a wife or a girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
Rachel : I love to ski! How amazing is this?
UNK: Dr. Schiff : -Are you experiencing any discomfort? -No, I'm very comfortable.
UNK: Dr. Schiff : -Any painful gas? -No!
Nurse : Dr. Schiff! What kind of question is that?
UNK: Dr. Schiff : Okay, then. Would you like to lie down on the table?
Rachel : Would you like me to lie down on the table?
UNK: Dr. Schiff : -Is there something going on here? -Do you feel it too?
UNK: -Hi. -How did your doctor's appointment go?
UNK: Well, let's see, they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.
Rachel : In the middle of the exam, I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.
Mona : -Oh, my God! -Why did you do that?
Phoebe : Remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
Mona : Oh, yeah! The Evander Holyfield phase.
Monica : Oh, man! You were so hard up, you practically came on to me.
Phoebe : You wish.
UNK: Hey, I could have had you if I wanted you.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah? Come and get it.
Rachel : Okay, even this is turning me on. You guys, I got problems.
Rachel : Oh, hey. Hey, Ross! How's it going with you and Mona?
Rachel : Are you guys still together?
UNK: Yeah, we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card.
UNK: You're doing a holiday card?
UNK: We're not just doing a card. She also wants to have the conversation..
Ross : about where the relationship is going.
UNK: Women!
Ross : I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?
Ross : No self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So where is this going?"
Rachel : Ross, you asked me that.
Ross : You were a closed book, okay? I'm not a mind reader!
UNK: What are you gonna say to her? Where is this relationship going?
UNK: I don't know. I really like her and I wanna keep dating her.
UNK: -So tell her that. -No, I can't.
UNK: Because then she's gonna say, "Well, it's not moving anywhere..
UNK: -then we should just break up." -Yeah, that's true.
Ross : Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really.
UNK: Maybe I need some kind of a gesture..
UNK: something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
Monica : Like asking her to move in with you?
Ross : Smaller than that.
UNK: -Making her a mix tape? -Bigger than that.
Phoebe : -Give her a key to your apartment. -We were closer with the mix tape.
Monica : Have you said, "I love you"? You could say, "I love you."
UNK: I don't think I'm quite there yet.
Ross : But I could say, "I love spending time with you."
Phoebe : -We hate that. -That is a slap in the face.
UNK: Forget it. You know what? I'll just have the conversation.
UNK: I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.
Ross : What do you think, Rach?
Rachel : I think if it was a little colder in here..
Rachel : I could see your nipples through that sweater.
UNK: Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8 : 00.
UNK: As it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
UNK: My ex-wife didn't work.
