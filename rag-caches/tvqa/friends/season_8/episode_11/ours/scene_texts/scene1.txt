UNK: -That's cute. -Bing! And the Bingette!
UNK: I thought it felt a little hotter in the office today.
UNK: -Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug. -Yes. Hi.
Doug : Good news! The divorce is final. I signed the papers this a.m.
UNK: I didn't know you and Kara divorced. I'm sorry.
UNK: Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.
Doug : -Congratulations to you guys, though. -No leg-chewing for us, sir.
Doug : Well, give it time.
Doug : So the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.
Doug : How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night.
UNK: I can't think of anything we're doing.
UNK: Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
Doug : Tomorrow night it is. I should be out of court by 6.
UNK: They keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me..
Doug : and I keep knocking them out of the park!
UNK: Okay, see you tomorrow.
Monica : Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.
UNK: Honey, once you get to know him, he's much, much worse.
UNK: I can't do this alone.
UNK: Honey, I'm sorry. I can't help you. I can't spend another evening with that man.
Monica : Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
UNK: That's because he wasn't invited.
Monica : Because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
UNK: Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it?
UNK: Oh, what the hell? B plus.
UNK: Hi! I went by the photo shop. Take a look.
Mona : Here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
UNK: Wow, that's great.
Mona : Do you think it should say, "Love, Ross and Mona"?
UNK: Well, we haven't said that to each other yet..
Ross : but I guess it's okay to say it to other people.
UNK: -How many did you want? I'll get 100. -A hundred?
UNK: Well, I guess I'll take..
UNK: Mona?
UNK: I'm not sure about the whole card thing.
Mona : Really? Why not?
Ross : Sending out a holiday card together?
UNK: I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
UNK: I didn't think of it that way. You're right.
Mona : -So can I ask you a question? -Yeah.
Mona : Where are we?
UNK: You know, where are we? Where is this relationship going?
Mona : I love spending time with you. I just hope we're moving forward.
UNK: We should talk about that, don't you think?
UNK: Let's do the card!
UNK: -What? -The card! I think we're there!
UNK: Okay. But I still think we should have this conversation.
UNK: Really?
Ross : Even with the card?
UNK: Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
Rachel : Oh, okay. Can I ask you a question?
UNK: Was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute?
UNK: You know who I'm talking about? Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?
UNK: Actually, never mind. I just answered my own question.
UNK: -Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff. -Yes, you are.
