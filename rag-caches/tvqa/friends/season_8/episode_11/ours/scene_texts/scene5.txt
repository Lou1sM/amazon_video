Ross : I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship!
UNK: -Why did you give her a key? -She talked me into a corner, okay?
UNK: She's like this conversational wizard.
UNK: So you had the conversation you didn't wanna have..
UNK: and you made the gesture you didn't wanna make.
UNK: Did I start this by saying, "Hey, I did something awesome today"?
UNK: -Do either of you have a key to my place? -I don't think you've ever given us keys.
UNK: Yeah, why would I? It's my home.
UNK: -Ross, how did the conversation go? -Great. I live on the street.
UNK: Where?
UNK: -Hi. -Okay, Monica, Rachel..
Phoebe : -this is my friend Roger. -Hi, Roger.
UNK: I'll get us some drinks. Could you help me?
Phoebe : Yeah, okay.
UNK: He's here to have sex with you.
UNK: -What? -You're welcome.
Rachel : -Phoebe, no! -It's okay. He's a virgin.
UNK: Rachel, I was talking to this guy. I think he'll have sex with you.
UNK: Let's leave these two alone.
UNK: No! I don't care what my hormones are doing! I won't do it with some random guy!
Phoebe : Fine! Then you tell Roger, because he was really looking forward to this!
Doug : Bing! Look at those twin sisters dancing together.
Doug : Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.
UNK: That's all right, sir. And that's just one girl.
UNK: -Bing, what's this? -It's a hand.
UNK: It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
UNK: It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it. We'll throw it in the East River!
UNK: -No! -Yes!
UNK: I did it, and I felt a lot better! You might even hit a seagull in the head.
UNK: Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.
Ross : Apparently, I give them away for no reason at all.
UNK: Ross, what's going on? You're changing the lock?
UNK: No.
Ross : That guy is.
Mona : You give me a key to your apartment, and then you change the lock?
Locksmith : Good luck, buddy.
UNK: I thought we were moving forward. Now you're sending me all these mixed signals.
Mona : What are you trying to tell me?
UNK: I'm trying to tell you..
Ross : I made you a mix tape.
UNK: -What? -I love you.
Mona : And I love spending time with you.
