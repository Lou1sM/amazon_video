UNK: -Hi, honey, I'm home. -From the tequila factory?
Chandler : It was awful.
Chandler : To get out of going to dinner with Doug, I told him you and I split up.
UNK: So then he took me to these strip clubs and sleazy bars.
UNK: When I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.
Monica : Come here. I can breathe through my mouth.
UNK: -Oh, sweetie. -You know what the worst part was?
Chandler : I got to see what my life would be like without you.
UNK: It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances.
UNK: Please promise me that you'll never leave me..
Chandler : that we'll grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
Monica : I promise.
Monica : Speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
UNK: I don't know if we're there yet.
