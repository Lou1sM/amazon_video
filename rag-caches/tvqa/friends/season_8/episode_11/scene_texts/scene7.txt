UNK: I'd like to order a pizza. Can I ask you a question?
Rachel : Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."
UNK: -I'll call you back. -Who was that?
UNK: -It's just the pizza place. -You hung up on the pizza place?
UNK: I don't hang up on your friends.
UNK: -Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day. -What's wrong?
UNK: -You don't want to hear about it. -Then why did I ask?
UNK: Okay, this is really embarrassing, but lately, with this whole pregnancy thing..
UNK: I'm just finding myself..
Rachel : How do I put this?
Rachel : Erotically charged.
UNK: Is that college talk for "horny"?
UNK: Yeah. I have all of these feelings, and I don't know what to do about them.
UNK: I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship.
Rachel : All I really want is one great night! Just sex.
Rachel : No strings attached. No relationship.
UNK: With someone I feel comfortable with, and who knows what he's doing.
Rachel : For just one great night. I mean, is that really so hard..
Rachel : to find?
Rachel : So how was your day?
UNK: Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Rachel : Well, I gotta get up early, and it's almost 7 : 00.
Joey : -I gotta go to my room. -Good night!
Rachel : Good night!
UNK: -I can't do it! -I didn't ask you to do it!
UNK: -You're Rachel! -You're Joey!
UNK: -You're my friend! -Right back at you.
UNK: Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad!
UNK: So bad! But I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't ask you to do anything!
Ross : I know!
Joey : -You wanna do it? -No!
UNK: -I'm just testing you! -Well, that's the end of this conversation!
Joey : -This conversation never happened! -Never happened!
Rachel : -Good night! -Good night!
Joey : Get back in there!
UNK: Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
UNK: It really wasn't right. And I want to make it up to you.
UNK: So I brought you something I think you'll really enjoy.
Phoebe : Now this is just a loan, okay? I'm gonna want him back.
UNK: I'm gonna go now.
UNK: I'm sorry. I thought I could do it, and I can't.
