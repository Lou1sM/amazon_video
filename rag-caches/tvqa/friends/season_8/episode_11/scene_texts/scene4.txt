UNK: Mona, it's time we had a conversation about where things are with us.
UNK: Yeah, I think I suggested that.
Ross : We are so..
UNK: Well, I really like you. And I love hanging out with you.
UNK: And I'm having a lot of fun.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: There's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.
UNK: It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
UNK: So where is it going?
UNK: That's the real question.
Ross : And the answer is..
UNK: it's going somewhere..
UNK: fun.
UNK: I know what you're thinking. Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.
UNK: But you're not getting any younger.
UNK: No! I mean, not you. Not you.
Ross : You are getting younger!
UNK: You're getting younger by the second. What's your secret?
UNK: I'm sorry, so where are we?
Ross : Well, to sum up..
UNK: we're having fun. You look young.
UNK: -Okay.. -But that's not enough.
UNK: So..
UNK: here's a key to my apartment.
UNK: -Really? -Really.
UNK: You don't think this is too fast?
Rachel : You gave her a key to your apartment?
Ross : Not just a key. I gave her the only key!
