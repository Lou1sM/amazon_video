Chandler : so I can access the really good Internet porn?
UNK: You're a joker, Bing.
UNK: What's funny about that?
Ross : -Sorry I kept you waiting so long. -That's okay. Where do you wanna go?
UNK: I think you know where I wanna go.
UNK: -The Hard Rock Cafe? -Yeah.
UNK: -Again? -Yeah.
UNK: -I'm telling you, I like the food. -You like the Purple Rain display.
Chandler : -Hey, Bob. -Hey, Toby. Have a good night.
Ross : -Did that guy just call you Toby? -Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
UNK: -Why don't you correct him? -It's been going on way too long now.
UNK: The first time, we were just passing each other, so I didn't say anything.
Chandler : The next time he said, "Toby, want a doughnut?"
UNK: I wanted the doughnut.
UNK: Five years later, the doughnut's gone and I'm still Toby.
Ross : -Chandler, you have to tell him. -That would be so awkward.
UNK: We don't work together. He's on the sixth floor.
Chandler : So he calls me Toby once in a while.
UNK: It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
UNK: Muriel. Why would he call you Muriel?
Ross : Oh, my God.
UNK: Chandler "M." Bing.
UNK: It's not just an "M." Your middle name is Muriel!
Chandler : It is a family name.
Ross : Chandler Muriel Bing.
UNK: Your parents never even gave you a chance, did they?
