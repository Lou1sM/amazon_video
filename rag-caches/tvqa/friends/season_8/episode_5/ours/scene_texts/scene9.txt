UNK: You work up here. Where's Chandler Bing's office?
UNK: Yeah, it's right..
Chandler : Right there. Let me ask you, why?
UNK: I wanna talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Chandler : Okay, Bob. Listen.
UNK: I'm the reason you didn't get the job.
UNK: -Toby, don't. -Bob.
UNK: Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover for him.
UNK: Anything you say will just get me more upset with Chandler.
Chandler : That puts me in a difficult position.
UNK: You do anything to Chandler, it's gonna bring you down to his level.
UNK: I guess you're right.
UNK: Don't give him the satisfaction. You're better than Chandler. We all are.
UNK: Especially me, Toby.
