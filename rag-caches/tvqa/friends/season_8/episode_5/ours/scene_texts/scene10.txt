Tim : -Is everything okay? -That depends.
UNK: -How are you and Phoebe? -Great. Thanks for introducing us.
UNK: My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
UNK: -Phoebe! -Monica!
UNK: -You're fired! -I'm breaking up with you!
UNK: I'm breaking up with you.
UNK: -You're fired. -Why?
UNK: I'm sorry. I'm not ready for a relationship right now.
UNK: I'm sorry too. But I like things done a certain way.
UNK: -The chemistry's just not right. -The chemistry thing for us too.
UNK: Wow. Okay.
Tim : I realize I came on a little strong. It's because I think you're amazing.
UNK: I wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity.
UNK: You're the most talented chef I've ever worked for.
UNK: Anyway..
Monica : -Tim, wait. -Yeah?
UNK: I spoke too quickly. There's a learning curve with this job.
UNK: Maybe we could try it again.
Phoebe : Thank you so much. I know I can be better.
UNK: And, Tim, I just want to say good luck here.
UNK: -Hello. -Hi.
Ross : How was the date?
UNK: I'm alone and I just bought $15 worth of candy bars. What do you think?
Rachel : -What happened? -I told him I was pregnant.
UNK: -He didn't take it so well? -Well, better than you.
UNK: -But still not what you want. -Oh?
UNK: Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery. Then he said :
UNK: "I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
Ross : -He sounds swell. -Doesn't he?
UNK: You want a little cheering up? Sit down.
Ross : Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Ross : Chandler M. Bing. Oh, my God.
UNK: -I'm sorry about your date. -It's all right.
UNK: I guess I'm just done with the dating thing.
UNK: Just one more thing in my life that's completely different.
Rachel : -This is hard. -Yeah, I know.
UNK: On the other hand, in seven months you're gonna have something..
UNK: that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with.
Joey : Just wait.
Ross : Wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
Ross : You have no idea.
Rachel : Thanks, sweetie.
Ross : -You wanna grab some coffee? -No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.
Ross : -I thought I cheered you up. -You did. There are 20 in here.
Bob : -Good night. -Good night.
UNK: Ross? Hey, it's Mona. From the wedding.
Ross : -Oh, hi! -Hi.
Ross : -How are you? -I'm good, except you owe me a dance.
UNK: That's right. Well, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
UNK: Oh, you're serious. Sure.
Ross : Great. Well..
UNK: -I think I need another cup of coffee. -Sure, let me get it for you.
UNK: Bob?
