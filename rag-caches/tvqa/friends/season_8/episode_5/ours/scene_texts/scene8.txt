UNK: Do you guys think this is too slutty? Hi, Kash.
Kash : -Hey, Rachel. You ready to go? -Yeah. See you guys later.
Ross : Have a great time, you guys. And yes, it is too slutty!
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: I'm glad you called. I feel like I'm always calling you.
UNK: What's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
UNK: It will be in a minute.
UNK: -Tim, you're a really great guy. -That's because I'm with you.
UNK: It's just, I'm in a place in my life right now where..
UNK: So sorry. "This just in."
UNK: It's the restaurant. Monica needs me right away.
UNK: No, she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
UNK: I'll miss you too, Pheebs.
Tim : And I will be holding you right here.
UNK: What movie do you wanna see? And not one I have to read.
UNK: I get that from books.
UNK: -Books? -Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes..
UNK: but it's enough!
UNK: Let's not see a movie. We'll just stay here and hang.
Joey : -Just wait for Rachel to come back? -Hey, if that's what you wanna do.
Joey : Dude, what is going on?
Ross : -I have to find out how it went. -Why?
UNK: -He could be my baby's stepfather. -One date and they're getting married?
UNK: He's not you!
UNK: I can't believe she's dating!
Joey : -What did you think she was gonna do? -I don't know.
UNK: -I can't believe this is happening. -What do you mean?
UNK: I thought when I had another kid, it'd be different.
Ross : I love Ben. But every time I drop him off at Carol and Susan's..
Ross : it breaks my heart a little.
UNK: I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed..
UNK: my kid comes running in, leaps up on the bed and we all read the paper.
Ross : Maybe fight over the science section.
UNK: -That's nice. You can still have that. -No. Rachel's out with some guy.
Ross : My baby went with her.
Ross : If anything, that picture keeps moving further away.
Joey : Hey, can I ask you something?
Joey : In this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
Ross : It used to be.
UNK: Now she doesn't really have a face.
UNK: Smokin' body, though.
UNK: Good call. But the face, Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
UNK: No. But how much easier would it be if it were?
UNK: That's not what she wants.
UNK: I know. And I can't force myself to fall in love with her.
Joey : Ross, maybe you need a new picture.
UNK: It won't be what you thought. But no matter what..
UNK: there's gonna be a brand-new little baby. Your baby.
Joey : Who cares what the picture looks like?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Let's you and me go out and have some fun.
Joey : Whatever you want. Come on.
UNK: -We can catch that Ukrainian film. -No, I said fun.
Bob : -Hey, Toby? -Hey, Bobby.
UNK: It's Bob, actually.
