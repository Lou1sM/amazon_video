Chandler : -Hey, Bob. -How's my pal Toby doing today?
UNK: If I see him, I'll ask.
UNK: Mr. Franklin : Was that Bob from six you were just talking to?
UNK: -Yeah. -You know him?
UNK: We're on a semi-first-name basis.
UNK: -What about adding him to our team? -Bob?
UNK: Working here with us? Every day? I don't know if he has what it takes.
UNK: Mr. Franklin : -They love him down on six. -But this is 11.
UNK: It's almost twice as hard up here.
UNK: -Okay, Bob will stay put. -I think it's best, sir.
UNK: We do need to find somebody. Work is starting to pile up.
UNK: I've got a stack of documents this high.
UNK: Just toss them in the shredder and claim you never got them.
UNK: That's a good one, Bing.
Chandler : What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?
