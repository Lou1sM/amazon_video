UNK: -Monica. -Hi.
Phoebe : I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet.
UNK: I can't wait to get "sous-neath" him.
Monica : -I have to fire him. -Why?
UNK: He's terrible. He's slow. He burns things.
Monica : He lit my pastry chef on fire.
UNK: He was nervous. You can be intimidating.
UNK: And your pastry chef can stand to be taken down a peg.
Monica : Well, now she has no eyebrows. Mission accomplished.
Phoebe : But, Monica, he loves his job so much.
UNK: Can't you just give him another chance, please?
UNK: All right. But if he lights someone else on fire, he's gone.
UNK: That's fair. Thank you so much.
UNK: Looks like he got you a little bit too.
Monica : I paid to have this done.
Phoebe : Love it!
