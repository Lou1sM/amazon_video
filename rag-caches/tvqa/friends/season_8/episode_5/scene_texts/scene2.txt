UNK: Drake, I've discovered the reason for your memory loss.
UNK: Dr. Drake Ramoray : What is it?
UNK: Joey's Co-star : Your brain transplant wasn't successful.
UNK: Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.
UNK: Dr. Drake Ramoray : Is it serious?
UNK: Joey's Co-star : Not if we extract tissue from the original body..
UNK: and synthesize antibodies to stop you from rejecting the brain.
UNK: Dr. Drake Ramoray : That sounds simple enough. Let's just do that.
UNK: Joey's Co-star : We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica's body..
UNK: Joey's Co-star : it was gone.
