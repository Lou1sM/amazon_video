UNK: This one's rare. This one's medium-well. Go!
UNK: Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!
UNK: Dinner was good! Just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Phoebe : -Well, hello there. -Hi.
UNK: I didn't see this on the menu.
Monica : Tim, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.
UNK: -So you're Monica's boss? -No, she's my boss.
UNK: -"Sous" is French for "under." -I "sous-stand."
Monica : Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad. And could you get me the pesto?
Phoebe : -You made pesto? -Yes, I did.
Phoebe : Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
UNK: I don't know. I would say it's pretty good-o.
UNK: I still need the calamari and salad.
Tim : I like your necklace.
UNK: "Coming up, Monica. I have to obey you, otherwise the system breaks down."
UNK: "I know that." "Then why are we having this conversation? "
Phoebe : -I made it myself. -You are so talented.
UNK: Well, it's no pesto.
UNK: Let's just cut to the chase. You're single. You're single.
UNK: He gets off work at 11. She'll be waiting for your call.
UNK: I'll give him your number if I could just get one calamari and one caesar salad!
Monica : I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
