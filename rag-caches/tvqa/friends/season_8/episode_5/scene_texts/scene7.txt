Monica : I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go.
Monica : I called the chef who recommended him to me.
UNK: He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"
UNK: -But don't fire him today. -Why?
UNK: -Because I'm dumping him today. -You said he was sweet.
UNK: He's too sweet. He calls me all the time.
UNK: "Did you get home okay? Was your shower okay?"
UNK: -Don't pick up the phone. -Then he comes over!
UNK: "I was so worried about you." Be a man!
UNK: So I can't fire him?
Phoebe : And dump him the same day? He'll kill himself.
UNK: I'll fire him, and you go out with him another week.
Phoebe : Are you kidding? Another week with that simp, I'll kill myself.
UNK: We'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it.
UNK: Okay. But who's gonna go first? Whoever goes second is the bitch.
UNK: -What? -Fire a guy that's just been dumped?
UNK: Bitch! And dump a guy that's just been fired?
Phoebe : Blond bitch!
Monica : I wanted to do this days ago, so I think I should go first.
Phoebe : All right, that makes sense.
UNK: But screw you! I'm going first!
Bob : -Toby, you got a sec? -Sure. What's up?
UNK: I wanted to get transferred up here, but it's not gonna happen.
Bob : Apparently somebody thinks I'm not "11th-floor material."
Bob : Say, who the hell is this Chandler?
UNK: What's the best excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight?
UNK: "I'm a recovering alcoholic," "I'm a Mormon"..
Rachel : or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk"?
UNK: You're not gonna tell him you're pregnant?
UNK: I don't think so. Books say wait till the third date to tell the guy..
UNK: you got something growing in your uterus.
UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
Ross : What do you want to do tonight?
UNK: There's a powerful Ukrainian film playing. Interested?
UNK: No. But I'll go see a normal-person movie with you.
Ross : -Rach, you wanna come? -I can't. I've got a date.
Rachel : -A date? -Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?
UNK: Why, no. It's the opposite of weird. It's regular.
UNK: It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.
UNK: It's no Ukrainian film.
UNK: Earrings!
UNK: -She's got a date? With who? -I set her up with this actor.
Ross : -You set her up? -No.
Ross : -What were you thinking? -That it was okay..
UNK: because you two haven't dated in five years.
UNK: I'm worried about my baby. Whoever she dates, my baby dates.
UNK: -Where is this "actor" taking them? -Hey! I'm an "actor" too.
UNK: They're taking the ferry to a place on Staten Island.
UNK: My baby's going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?
UNK: Aren't we talking about those big boats that go really slow?
UNK: Why not just jump out of an airplane or burn each other with matches?
Kash : -Hey, Joey. -Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.
UNK: Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
Ross : Bit of a daredevil, are we?
