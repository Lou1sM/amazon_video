UNK: Him, you're friends with.
UNK: -Excuse me, can I help you with something? -Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.
UNK: The Teacher : -Are you with one of the students? -I'm with Ben.
UNK: -Are you one of Ben's mothers? -I am one of Ben's mothers.
UNK: I'm a lesbian.
Phoebe : It was difficult coming out to my parents.
UNK: Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon. I'm a new teacher here.
UNK: -I've only met your partner, Carol. -That would make me Susan.
UNK: Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss his problems with Ben?
UNK: I think the parents should sit down together and have a conversation.
UNK: Yeah, let's do that!
Phoebe : That sounds good.
Phoebe : We should sit down and talk. Me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.
Phoebe : -How will I get in touch with them? -Their number's on the contact sheet.
Phoebe : Could I get a copy of that? Carol threw it out. She lost ours.
UNK: She's such a scatterbrain. But, man, what a hot piece of ass.
UNK: -You know, that party wasn't bad. -Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.
Monica : That was a fun surprise.
UNK: -I don't see a cab. Maybe we should walk. -No, we can't walk.
UNK: No. Hey, there's a cab.
UNK: That's a police car.
UNK: Maybe we could commit a crime, have them pick us up.
UNK: -It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on. -Okay.
UNK: Do you think we can get to the subway if we climb through that manhole?
UNK: -What's going on? -I can't walk, okay?
Monica : -These boots were a huge mistake. -What?
UNK: You were right. I never should have bought them. They're killing me, one toe at a time.
UNK: -So they're really tight, huh? -I just said you were right, sweetie.
UNK: Isn't it clear I'm delirious from the pain?
Chandler : So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.
UNK: It's oddly unsettling.
UNK: How are we gonna we get home? Maybe a piggyback ride?
UNK: I don't think me getting on your back is gonna improve matters.
UNK: Wow, being right sure doesn't help with the funny.
Chandler : -Hop on. -Okay, wait.
UNK: Let me just get my boots off first.
Monica : Oh, God.
UNK: I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned-on.
UNK: Do you ever worry that you'll be walking and your baby will just slip out?
Rachel : What college was that, Dina?
Dina : Oh, my God. Bobby?
Bobby : Hi, Dina. Good to see you.
Rachel : -Joey, what are you doing? -Just what needs to be done.
Joey : -Dearly beloved, we're gathered here.. -This is crazy.
UNK: Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!
UNK: -Where were we? Do you take this man..? -No!
UNK: -You'll take him. -No, I won't!
UNK: -You don't get a say. -Yes, I do.
UNK: -I heard "I do." We're halfway there. You. -All right, Joey, that is enough!
Rachel : As beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, this is not legal.
UNK: They don't have a marriage license or witnesses, and the groom only has one shoe.
Bobby : Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Joey : What am I supposed to do?
UNK: You're supposed to realize they are adults and that can make their own decisions.
UNK: No, they can't. They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Rachel : Contraceptives are not always effective. Right?
UNK: -Yeah. We kind of didn't use any. -Come on, kids, a little help here!
Phoebe : Wow! This place is incredible!
UNK: Sting's pen..
