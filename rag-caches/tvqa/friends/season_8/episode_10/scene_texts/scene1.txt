Monica : -Hey, guys. -Hey.
UNK: Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.
UNK: See, Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already. They're very practical.
Monica : You can wear them with dresses, skirts, pants..
UNK: You wear them with shorts on the corner and earn the money to pay for them.
UNK: -Wow, they're beautiful. -They hurt so much.
UNK: -What? -The guy who made these..
Monica : hates feet and wants to see them die.
Rachel : Give them to me. I haven't felt my feet in years.
UNK: I can't. I told Chandler I'd wear them all the time. I can't just give them away.
Phoebe : -Then get your money back and return them. -I can't do that either.
UNK: The soles are scuffed up, and the insides are filled with my blood.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey, I just picked up Ben from school.
UNK: I don't think you did a very thorough job.
UNK: I dropped him off at Carol's.
UNK: Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna get those tickets, though.
Phoebe : Oh, no. Why not?
UNK: It turns out Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
Phoebe : -How come? -Apparently, Sting's son made fun..
UNK: of the fact that Ben's moms are "lesbenims."
UNK: Wait. If they don't get along, smooth things over. Make them be friends.
UNK: -You can't force kids to be friends. -Sure you can.
Phoebe : Give them some blocks. Put them in a playpen.
UNK: -Playpen? Ben's 7. -Your kid is 7?
UNK: He's really small.
Phoebe : -Please get the tickets. -I'm sorry. I just can't do it.
Phoebe : -Yes, you can. Sting says so himself. -What?
UNK: Look, I'm sorry..
UNK: Phoebe?
UNK: Here she is : future fashion superstar.
UNK: -Oh, Joey, I'm hardly.. -My little sister Dina.
UNK: -Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you. -Hi.
UNK: Thanks so much for meeting with me. Joey's told me so much about you.
Joey : This is so exciting for her.
UNK: -Ralph Lauren smiled at her in the elevator. -You sure it was at you?
UNK: Because he likes it sometimes when the buttons light up.
UNK: Well, I'll let you two "fashists" get down to business.
UNK: You, be good, learn a lot. And if she takes you to the freebie room, I need shirts..
UNK: but none with that creepy logo with the guy riding the dog, holding the bone.
Rachel : Okay. All right, Dina.
UNK: Well, let's talk about the different areas of fashion..
Rachel : that you could get involved in.
UNK: Let's see, there's design. But you may need a whole other degree for that.
UNK: -Sales is great. You get to travel. -I don't care about fashion.
UNK: I'm pregnant. And I know you are too, so you gotta help me.
UNK: Then there's marketing.
