Phoebe : that he gave to Phoebe.
Phoebe : Come on, secret passageway.
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
UNK: I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
Phoebe : -Why else would I be here? -Why don't you sit down.
UNK: Trudie Styler : I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
UNK: I'm sure there are two sides to this story.
UNK: But all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a "poo-poo-head."
UNK: -I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us? -No.
UNK: I see. You see, I think it would be better for the children..
UNK: if all the parents were here. Except for, you know, Ben's birth mother and father.
UNK: Well, I'm sorry. Jack's father's not available.
Phoebe : Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule for Friday night, perhaps at 8 : 00?
UNK: No, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
Phoebe : Concert. Yeah. That does put us in quite a pickle.
UNK: I'm busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
UNK: Trudie Styler : So I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Phoebe : Unless.. Unless..
UNK: Okay, I would be willing to go to the concert..
Phoebe : all the while thinking about the children.
UNK: Trudie Styler : -Are you here for tickets? -Thank you. Four would be great.
UNK: I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this.
UNK: Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.
UNK: Look, I've just pressed a button triggering a silent alarm.
UNK: Trudie Styler : -Any minute now, the police will be here. -The Police? Here?
Phoebe : A reunion?
UNK: Okay, 10 blocks down. Five to go.
