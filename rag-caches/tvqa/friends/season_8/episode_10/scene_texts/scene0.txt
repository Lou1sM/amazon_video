UNK: -Hey. -Hey. So, what do you think?
UNK: New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
UNK: Boots? Boots!
UNK: Now, they're a little more than I usually spend on boots. Or rent.
UNK: Did you say you bought "boots" or "boats"?
Monica : I know.
UNK: -I'll miss being able to afford food. -I'm sorry. They just looked so good.
UNK: The saleswoman was like :
UNK: -"These are too expensive for you." -She had a point.
UNK: -Hey. -Hi. Oh, my God.
Rachel : -Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing. -They're mine!
UNK: -Too bad we're gonna have to return them. -Return them? They're gonna hear you.
UNK: I'm not returning them. I know they cost a lot, but I'll wear them all the time.
UNK: You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments.
Monica : Have you ever had something so beautiful, everyone wants it?
Chandler : -I have you. -Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.
UNK: -He's talking to the baby. -Oh! Okay.
UNK: Okay, because when he said, "I can't wait for your first words"..
UNK: I thought, "There's a trick."
Rachel : Well, I gotta go, you guys. I'll see you later.
UNK: -Okay. Bye. -Bye.
UNK: Hey, listen. Can you do me a favor? My sister knows you work at Ralph Lauren..
Rachel : Forget it. No way. I am not sending more Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.
Rachel : -It is a waste. -No, not her.
Joey : My youngest sister, Dina, is interested in fashion.
Joey : She wants to talk to someone successful to give her some advice.
UNK: -I guess I could talk to my supervisors. -No, she wants to talk to you.
UNK: Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.
UNK: -Okay, so would you meet with her? -Yes, I'd love to. Have her come by.
UNK: Great, thanks. You'll love her. She's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children.
UNK: -Yeah, you know the SATs? -Yeah.
UNK: She took them.
UNK: -Doesn't Ben go to Smithfield Day School? -Yeah. Why?
Phoebe : -Sting has a son that goes there too. -I know. He's in Ben's class.
UNK: You knew and never said anything? With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?
Ross : Fine, no more dinosaur stuff. Can I talk about fossils?
UNK: "Sting's son, 7 years old." And there's a picture.
UNK: What are you reading, "The Kidnapper's Guide to Manhattan Private Schools"?
UNK: It's New York Magazine. It's an article about the city's best schools.
Phoebe : -So how well do you know Sting? -I actually haven't even met him.
UNK: Yeah. That's too bad. I really wanna go to his concert Friday, but it's sold out.
UNK: I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets.
UNK: If you get two, I'll take you.
UNK: I'm picking Ben up tomorrow. Maybe he'll be there.
UNK: There you go. You're so lucky. You might get to meet Sting tomorrow.
UNK: That's why you have kids.
