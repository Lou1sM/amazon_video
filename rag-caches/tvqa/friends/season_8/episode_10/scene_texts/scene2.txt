UNK: -What's wrong? -Nothing. I just was yawning.
UNK: -Don't forget, my office party's tonight. -That's tonight?
UNK: I forgot all about the "secret Santa" gift.
UNK: Do we like this?
UNK: We don't really have to go to this thing, do we?
UNK: I know that you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots.
Chandler : See? Every cloud has a supple leather lining.
UNK: -I don't wanna wear the boots tonight. -Why not?
UNK: I'm worried your bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money.
Monica : Or your assistant will see them and want a raise.
UNK: Do you think I work some kind of boot-pricing company?
UNK: I picked out this outfit I wanna wear, and the boots don't go with it.
UNK: You said those boots go with skirts, dresses and pants.
UNK: What are you planning on wearing, a chicken suit?
Monica : Fine. If you want me to, I'll wear the boots.
UNK: In fact, I'll go into my room right now and try the outfit on.
Monica : Christmas party in my boots!
UNK: I can't go in there. I can't tell him.
UNK: It's gonna be okay. He has been incredibly supportive of me.
Rachel : And if he gets a little upset, that's what the meatball sub is for.
Dina : -Thank you. -Okay.
UNK: Hey! It's my fashion girls.
UNK: -What's wrong? -Why don't you sit down.
Rachel : Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
UNK: What's going on? Is it Mom? Is she sick?
UNK: Is it Dad's heart?
Joey : Is that a sandwich?
Dina : -Mom and Dad are fine. -Is that a sandwich?!
UNK: Joey, there's something that you should know. Dina?
UNK: -I'm pregnant. -What?
Rachel : Now. Give him the sandwich!
Joey : Obviously, this is a mistake. You can't be pregnant.
Joey : Because you have to have sex to get pregnant.
Dina : Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25, like you did.
Rachel : What? Dina..
UNK: I can't believe this. You're the good one. You went to college! Both years!
Joey : Who did this to you?
UNK: Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.
UNK: You got pregnant for "funny"? Dina, if he's funny, laugh!
UNK: -I'll be back. Stay here! -Why? Where you going?
UNK: I can't look at you right now.
Monica : I know.
