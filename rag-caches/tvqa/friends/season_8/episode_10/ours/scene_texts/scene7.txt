UNK: Just because they're not getting married doesn't mean it's a disaster.
Rachel : -Maybe they have a plan. -Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.
UNK: Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
UNK: Well..
Bobby : I really have high hopes for my band.
Joey : -You were right. He is funny. -Now, wait a minute.
UNK: I bet when you told people you wanted to be an actor, they laughed at you.
Rachel : Come on, Bobby, tell us a little bit about your band.
UNK: Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster. The band's name is Numbnuts.
UNK: Really?
UNK: If you're having a baby, you should be married.
Joey : Even if it is to Bobby. Dude, that's not a compliment.
UNK: -I knew you wouldn't be supportive. -So, what are you gonna do?
UNK: Have the baby and raise it by yourself? Without a husband?
UNK: You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
Rachel : -Excuse me. Am I ruining my life? -No, it's different for you.
UNK: You're so strong. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
UNK: The Teacher : -Excuse me? -One pregnant woman at a time, please!
Joey : I just want you to be okay.
Rachel : So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
UNK: Maybe.
UNK: Yeah. So, what kind of music does Numbnuts..?
UNK: Oh, forget it! I can't!
Dina : I am scared to death about this. But I think I can do it. I just need some help.
UNK: -Bobby's gonna be here the whole time. -You bet I am.
Bobby : And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.
UNK: Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her.
UNK: -Why can't you do that for me? -Because you're my baby sister!
UNK: And you're my big brother. You're my favorite guy in the whole world.
UNK: I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad. I was scared of telling you.
UNK: I'd be scared of them, but all right.
UNK: I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
Dina : I want him to have his uncle.
Dina : Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
UNK: Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey.
UNK: We'll be all right. Even if we're not married, this baby will be so loved.
UNK: -And not just by us. -That's right.
Joey : By his uncle too.
Bobby : And by you.
UNK: Bobby, why don't we come over here and let them have a little moment, okay?
Joey : Come here.
UNK: No, seriously, what's wrong with you?
UNK: Guess what.
UNK: We're good. We're good. We know each other.
UNK: So..
UNK: -anyway, guess what. -Oh, there's more?
UNK: You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!
Phoebe : Oh, my God, I do love you! How did you do it?
UNK: Well, let's just say :
Phoebe : -Where are the seats? -Middle balcony.
UNK: Would you say that's more than 50 yards away..
Phoebe : from Sting, his wife or a member of his family?
UNK: -Yeah. -Then that's not breaking the law. I'm there!
