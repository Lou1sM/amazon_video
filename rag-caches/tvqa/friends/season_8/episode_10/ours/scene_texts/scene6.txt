Monica : -Oh, wait! Stop, stop! -Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?
UNK: My boots in tan! Can you get a little closer so I see the price?
Chandler : I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
UNK: I'm sorry. I can walk the rest of the way now. Just give me my boots.
UNK: -I don't have your boots. -I don't have them either. Where are they?
UNK: Why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay?
UNK: Okay. My God, we gotta go back and get them!
UNK: Are you ever gonna wear the boots again?
UNK: Yes, I am. Okay? They're very practical.
UNK: -I could wear them with pants or skirts.. -Honey. Honey.
UNK: Okay, I'll never wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
UNK: You know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Rachel : -Okay. All right. -Okay.
UNK: Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!
