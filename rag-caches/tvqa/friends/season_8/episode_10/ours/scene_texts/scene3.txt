Phoebe : Oh, there you are, Ben.
UNK: You're Ben, right?
Ben : Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
UNK: I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys.
UNK: So I thought I'd come and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay.
UNK: Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.
UNK: Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.
Phoebe : Sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside..
Phoebe : but they have famous fathers.
Ben : I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
UNK: Wow, your friend Doug looks a lot like Billy Joel.
UNK: -Is that who his father is? -No. His dad's a dentist.
