Chandler : What are you doing?
UNK: Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party, before your wedding. It'll be more fun.
UNK: All right. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
UNK: How's it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman?
UNK: Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face every day..
Joey : until you finally have the sweet release of death.
UNK: You're right. This is more fun.
UNK: That's her! Okay, come on!
Stripper : Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
UNK: That's me!
UNK: That's me.
UNK: Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.
Stripper : -Is that a bedroom? -Yeah, right over there.
UNK: All right. Whenever you're ready.
Chandler : That was weird.
Joey : -Why would she go in the bedroom? -I'm waiting.
UNK: -So she's a.. -Yeah, that's one naked hooker.
Mona : I love your place. Where is this guy from?
UNK: That's an 18th-century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Mona : Oh. Wow.
UNK: So you're more than just dinosaurs.
Ross : So much more.
UNK: Oh, my God! I am so sorry!
UNK: Forget it. It's from Pier 1.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Dr. Green : You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?
UNK: I'm gonna kill you!
UNK: You know, this is actually not a great time for me.
UNK: Dr. Green : So come on. Explain yourself, Geller.
UNK: Dr. Green : -First, you get my Rachel pregnant. -You got Rachel pregnant?
Ross : -Who did? -You did!
UNK: Yes, I did, but it was a one-night thing. It meant nothing.
UNK: Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you, nothing?
UNK: No, sir. She means a lot to me. I care.. I love Rachel.
UNK: -What? -But not that way.
UNK: I'm not in love with her. I love her like a friend.
UNK: That's how you treat a friend, get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?
Ross : Hey, I offered to marry her. But I didn't want to.
UNK: Well, why not? So you could spend your time with this tramp?
UNK: Tramp?
UNK: I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
UNK: I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
UNK: Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper..
Joey : but she got confused about what to do.
Chandler : Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip. We just missed it.
UNK: Ma'am?
Chandler : Are you also a stripper?
UNK: No, but I can pretend to strip. But that's gonna cost extra.
UNK: Okay, here's the extras : handcuffs, spanking..
UNK: Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.
Joey : Getting her own husband a hooker. That's pretty funny.
Chandler : That is funny. Maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
UNK: I'll bet Ross was in on it too. I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.
Hooker : -Do you mind if I smoke in here? -Actually, I'd rather..
UNK: Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
UNK: -How could you have kept all this from me? -I was going to tell you, but..
