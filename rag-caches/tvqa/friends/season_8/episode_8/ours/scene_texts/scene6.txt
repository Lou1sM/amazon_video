Monica : Hi. We spoke on the phone.
Ross : So your dad dropped by.
UNK: He's a pleasant man.
Rachel : -Oh, no. -I better go.
UNK: Just over here. I don't wanna miss the fight.
UNK: Ross, I am so sorry.
UNK: I promise, I will straighten this out with him tomorrow, in person.
Rachel : Or via e-mail.
UNK: I don't care about your dad. I care about Mona. She was there and she's freaked out!
UNK: Okay, I'll fix that too. What's her e-mail address?
UNK: All right, I promise, I'll fix this. I swear. I'll talk to her.
UNK: Okay. Thank you.
UNK: That's it? You call that a fight?
UNK: "We were on a break!" "No, we weren't!" What happened to you two?
Ross : Thank you so much for coming back over.
