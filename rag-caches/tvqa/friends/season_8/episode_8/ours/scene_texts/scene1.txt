UNK: It was cool seeing you lecture today.
UNK: Thanks. Although it kind of seemed like you were falling asleep.
UNK: No, I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and, you know, take it all in.
Ross : Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
UNK: -I've got to get going. -Okay, I'll see you tonight?
UNK: Thanks for showing me your semiprecious-stone collection. It's amazing.
Chandler : My God, you must be good in bed.
UNK: So you and Mona, it's been a while now. How's it going?
UNK: It's good. It's going good.
Ross : I mean, we get along great. She's so..
UNK: -Hot? -I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!
UNK: She's okay with the baby?
UNK: I haven't actually told her yet. I don't wanna scare her off.
UNK: You have to be honest. Otherwise, you may think you're going down the same path..
UNK: but you're really going down different ones.
UNK: I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.
Monica : Oh, my God, you are gonna love me so much.
UNK: Oh, good. Because so far in this marriage, I just like you a lot.
UNK: All right. I felt bad about the bachelorette party thing..
UNK: so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
Monica : I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you.
Monica : Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?
UNK: -Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper. -Will you let the lady talk?
UNK: Come on, it'll be fun. It'll make me feel so much better.
UNK: I got you party hats and porn.
UNK: Throw in my father making out with the magician..
UNK: and it's just like my 14th birthday all over again.
UNK: Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy. I'm not a bachelor anymore.
UNK: Don't think of it as a bachelor party. Think of it as a two-month anniversary present.
Ross : Sure. One year is paper, but two months is lap dance.
Monica : Please, I feel so bad. Just watch the hot woman get naked!
UNK: -Fine, but I'm only doing this for you. -Yeah!
UNK: [scene : And Joey.
UNK: -Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite? -Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
UNK: Actually, sorry, I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona tonight.
UNK: Who would cancel an actual date just to go to a fake bachelor party?
UNK: I'm sorry. I gotta cancel tonight, baby.
UNK: I'm sorry I won't make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm busy that day.
Phoebe : I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Rachel : I know, I know. I panicked.
UNK: I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
UNK: It's Lafite.
UNK: The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
UNK: All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna be strong.
UNK: Dr. Green : I just called a friend of mine.
UNK: Dr. Green : I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Dr. Green : The Plaza?
Rachel : Oh, Daddy!
Rachel : -Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. -What is it, sweetie?
UNK: There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I aren't getting married.
UNK: -I'm sorry, Daddy. -I don't believe this!
Rachel : -Daddy, stay calm, please. -How do you expect me to stay calm?
UNK: Dr. Green : This is unacceptable, Rachel. And I wanna know why!
UNK: Dr. Green : Is it because that punk won't marry you?
UNK: Dr. Green : -Is that it? -Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.
Joey : You nervous about getting married?
