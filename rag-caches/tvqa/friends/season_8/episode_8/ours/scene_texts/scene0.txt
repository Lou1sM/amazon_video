UNK: Hey, I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night. Do you wanna come?
UNK: Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.
UNK: Oh, no, I'll be there too.
UNK: So we'll come up with some kind of signal. If it's going well, you can take off.
UNK: No, I just need you there for support. I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.
Phoebe : Oh. Why not?
UNK: Because I know he's gonna flip out, and I hate it when he's angry.
Phoebe : Rachel, this is all so "Papa Don't Preach."
UNK: No, Phoeb, wait. He's a scary guy. I mean, one time he caught me smoking.
Rachel : He said if he ever saw me doing that again, he'd make me eat the entire pack.
UNK: Wow. Well, I will be there.
UNK: Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby!
Phoebe : Hey, who is that guy? I think I know him.
UNK: No, you don't.
UNK: Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper from your bachelorette party!
Chandler : Her what?
Phoebe : Your secret bachelorette party.
Chandler : -You had a bachelorette party? -She untied his G-string with her teeth.
Phoebe : Somebody stop me!
UNK: We weren't having bachelor, bachelorette parties. We agreed that it's a silly tradition.
UNK: It's a grand tradition!
UNK: I'm sorry. They surprised me. There was nothing I could do.
UNK: Well, you could've untied it with your hands.
UNK: This is so unfair. The one thing I wanted was to throw my best friend a bachelor party..
UNK: but I wasn't allowed. All we got was a stupid steak dinner.
Chandler : You went home with the waitress.
Joey : Yeah, that was a pretty good night.
UNK: I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Chandler : You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty.
Monica : I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass.
UNK: -I don't eat that either. -I never understand you lesbians.
UNK: -So, baby, tell me, what's new with you? -Well, actually..
UNK: Your '74 Lafite, sir.
UNK: I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine. The '74 is sewage!
UNK: Dr. Green : Why would you bring me sewage?
UNK: Dr. Green : Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
Waiter : This is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you.
UNK: Dr. Green : Oh, come on. Don't be such a baby.
UNK: In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
UNK: He's right, though. The '74 is absolute piss.
Rachel : This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't.
UNK: Rachel..
UNK: I'm gonna wait a couple of years, and then the baby will tell him.
Phoebe : -Why? So he can get mad at the baby? -Hey, that is the baby's problem.
Rachel : -Everything okay with the waiter? -I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.
UNK: Dr. Green : So, sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is new with you.
Rachel : I got TiVo.
UNK: -What's TiVo? -It's slang for "pregnant."
UNK: Well, what were you thinking asking me to come?
UNK: Dr. Green : Are you really pregnant?
Rachel : Well, yes and no.
Rachel : Except, not no.
Rachel : So to sum it up, yeah.
UNK: Dr. Green : Who is the father? Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.
UNK: No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.
UNK: Daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this.
Rachel : Think about it. This is a good thing. This is your first grandchild!
UNK: You're gonna be a poppy!
UNK: That's true. I'm a poppy!
UNK: I'm gonna be a poppy!
UNK: Dr. Green : -So when is the wedding? -The who?
UNK: Dr. Green : The wedding. There's going to be a wedding.
UNK: Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!
UNK: -Tell me there's gonna be a wedding! -February 2nd!
