UNK: Listen, again, I want to urge you to push the duck special..
UNK: because if they don't eat the duck, you're going to, and it's not very good.
UNK: Tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
UNK: -Thanks for giving me that girl's number. -No problem. Say, who's the party for?
UNK: -For my husband. -You hired your husband a hooker?
UNK: -She's a stripper. -No, she's a hooker.
Monica : -Is that what they call strippers sometimes? -When they're hookers.
Phoebe : Oh, my God. Stu, I can't believe you did this.
UNK: Now, you're sure she's a hooker?
UNK: It's either that, or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
Joey : Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
