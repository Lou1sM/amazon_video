Ross : What are..? Hi! How are you?
UNK: I'm supposed to pick you up.
UNK: I made you a Valentine's dinner. Surprise!
Rachel : -Oh! Hey, Mona! -Hi, Rachel.
UNK: What's she doing here?
Ross : I have no idea.
UNK: I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
Mona : What is she doing?
Ross : Lately she just likes hanging out here.
UNK: -Why? -I think she's lonely.
UNK: But it's Valentine's Day. Can't we ask her to go?
UNK: Well, no, she's way too emotional.
Ross : And by emotional, I mean crazy!
UNK: That's just my Chinese food.
Mona : She has food delivered here?
UNK: Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.
UNK: I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.
Ross : And you thought she was gonna be in our way!
Ross : Open the champagne, and I will be right back.
