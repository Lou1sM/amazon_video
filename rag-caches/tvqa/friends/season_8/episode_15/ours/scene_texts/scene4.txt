Ross : -How was Atlantic City? -Good.
Mona : I brought you back a present.
UNK: You didn't have to..
Ross : Saltwater taffy?!
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater.
UNK: It's actually made with salted fresh water.
UNK: That's not interesting.
UNK: -I think it's interesting. -Me too. I missed you!
UNK: Me too.
Mona : -How was your week? -Good.
Ross : -The baby started kicking. -How exciting!
UNK: It was amazing. The only thing is, I wasn't there the first time.
Joey : -Oh, no. -I was missing out on all this stuff.
Ross : -Joey suggested Rachel move in with me. -Yeah, right.
UNK: -What? -Joey cracks me up.
UNK: "Have your ex-wife move in. That wouldn't be awkward."
Mona : Imagine, I go away for a few days..
Mona : and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant.
UNK: So, what'd you tell him?
UNK: You didn't tell Mona Rachel moved in?
Ross : She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
