UNK: Happy Valentine's!
UNK: I'm slipping into something a bit less comfortable and a bit more slutty.
UNK: "Candy and Cookie"?
UNK: "Candy and Cookie"?!
Chandler : Monica got me porn?
Chandler : Girl-on-girl porn?!
Chandler : She really must love me!
UNK: Man On Tv : -Yeah, just relax. -I love you, St. Valentine.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.
UNK: Man On Tv : Now push!
UNK: Oh, God, it hurts!
Chandler : Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
UNK: -Oh, make it stop! -I am trying!
Joey : Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!
UNK: You're cute, but you're not too smart.
Joey : Did I just throw this?
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
Rachel : I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
Rachel : -Who is this? -Phoebe's friend's dog.
UNK: I don't know his real name. I call him Mozzarella.
Rachel : You are so cute. I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work.
Rachel : I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting. Yes, I do.
Rachel : Bye-bye, Joey. Seriously, I can't stop it.
UNK: Come here! Hey!
UNK: That's Rachel. She used to live here.
Joey : Might as well be honest with you. We love her.
UNK: But we can't have her.
Joey : I really miss her.
Joey : Hey, you understand, right? You're a guy.
Joey : Well, you used to be.
Monica : So, what do you think?
UNK: I've still got it.
Chandler : -Why did you get me this? -What is it?
UNK: It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.
Chandler : Oh, the dilating!
UNK: Is this the video of the birth? It's Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?
UNK: I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
UNK: If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day..
Monica : you were right.
UNK: It's about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom..
Monica : but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
UNK: It got four stars.
UNK: Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.
UNK: -Anyway, you wanna take a look? -Well..
UNK: -I'm not really in a sexy mood. -Hey, what's going on?
Chandler : Remember the first time you saw Jaws..
Chandler : how long it took to go back in the water?
UNK: We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
UNK: You gotta get past it.
UNK: Just get back on the horse.
UNK: Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the bedroom and change into her sweatpants.
UNK: -Okay, you don't know. You didn't see it. -Childbirth is beautiful.
Chandler : Oh, beautiful? Really?
Chandler : You think this is beautiful?
Monica : Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
