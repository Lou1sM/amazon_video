Phoebe : -Oh! Hey, Rach! -Hi.
UNK: -Happy Valentine's Day! -You too!
UNK: How's living at Ross'?
UNK: It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long.
Rachel : Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
Rachel : Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
UNK: That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Phoebe : I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this.
Phoebe : Is there anything I can do for you? Do you wanna look down my top?
UNK: Thanks. Maybe later.
Phoebe : -Gunther, can I get a scone? -Want anything?
Joey : I want a lot of things.
UNK: I wanna be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day.
Joey : I want her to love me back.
UNK: And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
Gunther : We have red bagels.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: There was a drumstick in the couch.
UNK: And I am not uptight about crumbs.
UNK: It's just that, you know..
UNK: crumbs attract mice. And mice leave droppings.
UNK: And that's how the plague started.
UNK: So you wanna relive that again..
UNK: Mice didn't start the plague.
UNK: Rats did.
UNK: Rattus norvegicus, to be exact.
UNK: Oh, good God, Ross.
UNK: Nick at Nite, once in a while.
UNK: All right, I'm going. Bye.
UNK: Phoebe, will you wait here?
UNK: -I wanna get your opinion on something. -Yeah.
Phoebe : How does Mona feel about Rachel moving in?
UNK: I'm on my way to tell her.
UNK: She's been away all week, but she'll be cool.
UNK: She's been so supportive.
UNK: She even got the baby a T-shirt that says "Fossils are my friends."
UNK: Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.
UNK: So I'm gonna take off.
Phoebe : Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot! Rachel wanted to see this tape.
Ross : -What is it? -My friend giving birth.
UNK: Could you take it to your apartment?
UNK: "Candy and Cookie"?
UNK: Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter.
UNK: The father's name is also Cookie.
Phoebe : Why am I friends with these people?
UNK: Phoebe, come here.
UNK: I wanna show you something in the bathroom.
Phoebe : Monica, grow up.
UNK: -What's behind your back? -Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.
UNK: -You don't want my opinion? -Not really.
UNK: Come on, I'm your older brother. Ask me.
UNK: Okay, big brother.
UNK: Which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister?
Ross : The red one.
