UNK: No, the baby's out. Look.
Monica : Look at those little fingers and toes.
Chandler : Look how happy the mom is now.
Mona : -Oh, Rach. -Screw you! You don't have to do it!
UNK: -Hey. -Hey!
UNK: -What's up? -Mona just dumped me.
UNK: Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
UNK: Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.
UNK: I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
Ross : I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Ross : Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
UNK: In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.
Joey : That really sucks. Especially on Valentine's Day.
Monica : Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
UNK: Joey without a date on Valentine's Day?
UNK: What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Joey : -Sort of. -Really?
UNK: You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Ross : Maybe I can help.
Ross : Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me.
UNK: You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex.
UNK: -So anyway, what is it? -Forget about it. It's no big deal.
UNK: -Come on, what is it? -It's nothing.
UNK: Hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
UNK: Okay. Sit down.
UNK: There's this woman that I like a lot.
UNK: But it can't happen.
UNK: She's not a Tribbiani?
UNK: No!
Ross : So is she someone from work?
UNK: Yes.
Ross : Well, does she like you?
UNK: Sometimes I think she could.
UNK: But I can't do anything about it.
Ross : Why not?
UNK: It's complicated.
UNK: She was with this other guy for a long time.
Joey : Someone from work too.
Joey : I could never do that to the guy. We're friends.
UNK: Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work.
UNK: No, no. I only say that..
UNK: so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
UNK: Excuse me?
UNK: Sorry, sorry. And I'm your only friend too.
Ross : So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?
UNK: -No, I don't think so. -Okay.
Ross : Is he a good guy?
UNK: Yeah, he's the best.
Ross : -Then talk to him. -I don't know.
UNK: It's worth finding out, if you like her.
Joey : I do, so much.
UNK: I can't stop thinking about her. I can't sleep..
Joey : You know what? You have to go for it.
Ross : How often does this happen to you? You owe it to yourself.
UNK: Here's your warm milk.
UNK: I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
UNK: Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?
UNK: Let me know how it goes.
UNK: It's Rachel.
UNK: You're having a baby and you need to prepare.
UNK: You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
UNK: Woman On Tv : I came to the big city to become a star.
UNK: -I'll do anything to make that happen. -Anything?
Rachel : Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
UNK: I wonder which one of these guys becomes the father.
Ross : No, no. Can't get pregnant that way.
