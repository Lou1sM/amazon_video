UNK: Plus, she got me taffy.
UNK: -Really? I've never had any. -Ever?
UNK: My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: Are you gonna tell her?
UNK: I will. I want to butter her up first.
UNK: I'm gonna take her to dinner, do all this romantic stuff.
Ross : When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever..
UNK: I'll tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
UNK: If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady.
UNK: So where are..? What the crap is up with this stuff?
UNK: Is it gum? Is it food? What's the deal?
UNK: Oh, it's nice. May I try a pink one?
UNK: So I just have to plan the perfect night.
UNK: Hey, what's the best date you ever had?
UNK: Last year, Greg Hayman took me to a very nice sushi dinner.
UNK: Then we took a romantic walk to a nearby research lab..
UNK: where we trashed the place and freed 20 monkeys.
Ross : I knew it! I knew I wasn't crazy!
UNK: Last year, a monkey did attack me at the bus stop!
Joey : So between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross..
UNK: it just isn't gonna happen.
Joey : It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
UNK: How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog?
UNK: You're subdued.
Phoebe : -Did you give him a beer? -No.
Phoebe : -Will you excuse us? We need to talk. -Sure.
Joey : Oh, me, right.
UNK: -He's miserable. What happened to him? -Nothing.
UNK: -We talked about stuff. -What stuff?
Joey : Rachel stuff.
UNK: Oh, Joey, you bummed him out! This is the happiest dog in the world.
UNK: He spends a day with you, and look!
UNK: He's breathing.
UNK: Okay, well, he's watching us so just look happy, okay?
UNK: -I'll take him to Wendy's. -He's fine.
UNK: Look.
UNK: Here's your ball!
Joey : Get your ball! Get your ball!
UNK: Get..
Monica : Of course.
UNK: You don't want a tennis ball.
UNK: Not when you can have a meatball.
UNK: Come on, get the meatball.
Joey : God, what have I done to you?
Joey : I broke the dog, Pheebs! I broke the dog!
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: I'm going to pick up Mona. What are you doing tonight?
UNK: Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.
UNK: I got my Chinese food on the way, and your saltwater taffy.
UNK: Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater..
Rachel : We actually watched the documentary together.
Rachel : Oh, my Chinese food. I'll get my cash.
UNK: Mona?
