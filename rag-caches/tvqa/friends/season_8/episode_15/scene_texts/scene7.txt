UNK: -I've got a surprise. -You got another ex-wife back there?
Ross : Please start drinking.
UNK: -I'm just gonna grab the phone. -Rachel, wait.
UNK: I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
Ross : -What are you doing? -Do you need the phone?
UNK: No.
UNK: Ross is too nice to say it, but this is his apartment.
UNK: We need boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place.
Rachel : But, Mona, I live here.
UNK: Happy Valentine's Day!
Ross : Or, something to remember me by.
Monica : -How long has it been this time? -Ninety seconds.
UNK: Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
Monica : Except all I did was think about it.
UNK: I know. It haunts me.
UNK: Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy.
Chandler : After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver.
Monica : We have to get past this. We'll pretend it never existed.
UNK: I could do that.
UNK: Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
Monica : -Oh, thank God! -I know.
Monica : Come in!
UNK: Hi. I'm sorry to barge in on your Valentine.
UNK: I had to get away from the yelling. Mona's dumping Ross.
Monica : -Oh, my God. -Poor Ross.
UNK: We watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes.
Monica : You know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
UNK: It's here.
UNK: We should warn you before you watch it. Don't watch it.
Rachel : You saw it? Is it scary?
UNK: It's ironic how footage of someone being born..
Chandler : can make you want to kill yourself.
UNK: Honey, she may not have to watch it but she's going to have to do it.
UNK: Now I'm all freaked out. Will you watch it with me?
Monica : No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you.
UNK: Monica, come on. You want to have kids.
Joey : I do.
UNK: But the stork is gonna bring mine.
UNK: Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone.
UNK: She's right. Of course not.
Monica : Honey, get the tape.
Chandler : This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
UNK: Oh, sure. But if you leave a drumstick under there and you're a bad roommate.
Chandler : Here we go.
UNK: Okay.
Monica : Oh, my.
UNK: Come on, come on.
Rachel : Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Chandler : Why have I seen this thing three times?
UNK: It's beautiful.
UNK: -It's horrible! -I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!
UNK: What do I do? I don't want to do this! How do I get out of it?
UNK: -You guys! You guys, look! -What? Did her ass explode?
