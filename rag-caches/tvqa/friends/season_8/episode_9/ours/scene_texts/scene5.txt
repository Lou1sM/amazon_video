UNK: -Ross? -It was no big deal.
UNK: We said that.. The rumor was that..
UNK: you had both male and female reproductive parts.
UNK: -What? -That's right. We said your parents..
Will : flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Rachel : -Oh, my God! -You started that?
Rachel : -You heard that? -Everyone at our school heard it!
UNK: Everyone at my school heard it. You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?
Rachel : Oh, no!
UNK: It makes sense now. This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me.
UNK: Why Billy would just stay in this region.
UNK: Billy's gay now, so that one's not really our fault.
UNK: -Why didn't you tell me? -I thought it might be true.
Monica : I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
UNK: Stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
UNK: I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
UNK: Come on, whip it out.
Joey : You are my Everest.
UNK: -You don't have to finish. -I do. Otherwise, what's next?
UNK: Today I can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I eat half a PowerBar..
UNK: wrap it up and put it in the fridge? No!
UNK: I gotta change my pants. What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.
UNK: Guys, help me with the dishes. There's a lot of pots and pans.
UNK: Honey, I'd love to, but the second game is about to start.
UNK: Oh, yeah, the second game. More football for the Pheebster.
UNK: -Who's playing? -Los Angeles.
UNK: Last time I checked, Los Angeles didn't have a football team.
UNK: Did I say Los Angeles? I meant the team that used to be in Los Angeles..
UNK: and is now in St. Louis. I actually knew that.
UNK: Okay, quick, name three players on that team.
UNK: Gretzky..
UNK: Agassi..
UNK: I'm a pretty little girl.
Rachel : Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year.
UNK: "Dear Rach, you're such a great person." Not girl, "person."
UNK: I think you're reading a little too much into it.
UNK: "You're a great person. Sorry about your teeny weenie."
Ross : What do you want me to do..
Ross : call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?
UNK: -Yes. -Also, tell them I'm skinny now.
Monica : Oh! Me too!
UNK: I won't call anybody. It was a million years ago.
UNK: I don't care. You told people that I was half and half!
Rachel : I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
UNK: That's not totally true.
UNK: -What? -What?
Monica : You did start that rumor about Ross..
UNK: making out with Mrs. Altmann, our 50-year-old librarian.
Ross : How did you know that?
UNK: -It's true? -No.
Rachel : Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog.
UNK: -Hey, what were you doing in the library? -They had magazines.
UNK: Mrs. Altmann? She also made out..
UNK: with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
Chandler : In high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
UNK: -Hey, she didn't look 50! -Did she look 16?
UNK: There's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
UNK: -Wow. -She didn't photograph well!
