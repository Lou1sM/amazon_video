Phoebe : -Happy Thanksgiving. -Will, I'm so glad that you came.
UNK: You look great. You must've lost..
UNK: 150 pounds. I'll be on one of those Subway commercials.
Monica : -A pie! -It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.
UNK: -It's no good. Throw it out. -Meet some people.
Monica : This is my husband, Chandler. This is Will.
UNK: Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but I'm really into the game.
UNK: Plus, it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand next to each other.
Monica : -This is Phoebe. -Hi.
UNK: Hey. Wow!
Phoebe : Well done.
Monica : -Wanna give me a hand? -I can't get over how great you look.
UNK: -You look incredible too. You're so fit. -I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.
Monica : -I meant to tell you, Ross is coming. -Great, I love Ross.
UNK: Good. And Rachel Greene too.
Monica : -Is there a problem? -No. It's okay.
UNK: It's just.. God, I hated her.
UNK: -What? -I hated her.
Will : She was horrible to me in high school.
UNK: But hey, that was a long time ago. I'm in a good place. Might be fun to see her again.
Will : Got any cakes or cookies or something?
Will : No, Will! No!
UNK: It's been a while since we screamed. Maybe we should.
UNK: -Oh, okay. No! -Come on!
Phoebe : Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!
Monica : What are you doing? You've got an entire turkey to eat.
Joey : Let me explain to you how the human body works.
UNK: I have to warm up my stomach first.
UNK: -Eating chips is like stretching. -Okay.
UNK: -Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full. -I'm here to tell you something.
UNK: You can eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill that void.
Joey : -Who the hell is this guy? -This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.
UNK: -Want some chips? -No.
UNK: -Will! -Ross!
Ross : Hey, you came! Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!
Ross : -Hot stuff? -It's good to see you, man.
UNK: Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?
UNK: -I'm a commodities broker. -That sounds interesting.
UNK: -Yeah, it's not. -Oh.
UNK: -But I'm rich and thin. -Oh.
UNK: I haven't seen you since Lance Davis' graduation party.
Will : That was such a fun night.
UNK: Would've been good if we had gotten in, but still fun.
UNK: We were lame. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
UNK: -Yeah. -So, what do you do now?
Ross : So how long are you in town?
UNK: -Hi. -Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.
UNK: Rachel Greene.
UNK: Oh, that's right. Are you gonna be okay?
UNK: Oh, I'll be fine. It's just.. God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!
UNK: High school was a long time ago.
UNK: Look at her standing there with those yams.
UNK: My two greatest enemies : Rachel Greene and complex carbohydrates.
UNK: Oh, my God. Who is that?
UNK: -That's Will, from high school. -Oh! I do not remember him.
UNK: Wow, really got that sexy smoldering thing going on.
UNK: Oh, my God. Look at the way he's just staring at me.
UNK: He's trying to mouth something to me.
