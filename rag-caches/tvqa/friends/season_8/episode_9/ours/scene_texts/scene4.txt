UNK: That's it? Even if nobody helps me, I can eat that. No problem.
Joey : -At least give me a challenge. -This is Chandler's chicken.
Monica : This is the turkey.
UNK: Oh. How big is that?
UNK: -About 19 pounds. -It's like me when I was born.
Rachel : -Who would like some yams? Will? -You'd like that, wouldn't you?
UNK: What? Oh, can we please keep the chicken..
UNK: and the turkey on the other side?
Rachel : -The smell is just.. -Typical.
UNK: -What? -I said it was typical.
UNK: Typical of you. Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in Rachel-land.
Joey : Seriously, who is this guy?
UNK: Sorry, do you have a problem with me?
UNK: -I don't know. Do I? Do I? -I think you do.
UNK: You were a little mean to him in high school.
Will : -A little mean? You made my life miserable. -I had no idea. I'm sorry.
Will : Well, you should be. Screw it. Bring on the yams.
UNK: But you worked so hard.
UNK: -Yams! -Okay.
UNK: I'm real sorry for whatever I did to you in high school.
UNK: It wasn't just me. We had a club.
Rachel : -You had a club? -The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!
UNK: So you all just joined together to hate me?
Rachel : -Who else was in this club? -Me and Ross.
Ross : No need to point. She knows who Ross is.
UNK: -You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club? -Yes, he was.
Rachel : No, no.
Rachel : -So who else was in this club? -That exchange student from Thailand.
UNK: But I don't think he knew what it was.
UNK: You guys were cool.
Rachel : So, Ross, we went out for two years..
Rachel : and you never told me you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?
Will : You went out with her? We had a pact.
UNK: -It's not like it was binding forever. -It had the word "eternity" in it.
UNK: I'm thinking of joining an "I Hate Turkey Club."
UNK: Although, I do love a turkey club.
Rachel : Monica? Did you know about this?
UNK: I didn't. Is that why you used to lock the bedroom door?
UNK: -Yeah. -A little relieved, I gotta say.
UNK: Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay? I was a stupid kid, okay?
Ross : -The only reason I joined.. -Cofounded.
UNK: Cofounded.
Ross : Cofounded the club, was that I was in love with you.
UNK: I didn't handle it very well. If you think about it, the "I Hate Rachel Club"..
Ross : was really the "I Love Rachel Club."
Will : Except that it was really the "I Hate Rachel Club."
UNK: So you'd get together and say mean things about me?
Will : -We did a little more than that. -No, no, no.
Phoebe : What else did you do?
Will : -We started a rumor. -What rumor?
Phoebe : Come on, Will, just take off your shirt and tell us.
