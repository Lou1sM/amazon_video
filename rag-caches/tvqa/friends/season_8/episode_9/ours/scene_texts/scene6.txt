UNK: She probably wasn't familiar with the process..
Chandler : having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings.
UNK: How did this happen? Did she lure you to an early-bird dinner?
Ross : I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us.
Ross : She needed some help with her word jumble.
Ross : And one thing led to another.
Ross : If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender.
Ross : May she rest in peace.
UNK: -Didn't she walk with a cane? -Only when it was damp!
UNK: I can't believe you told people about this. Everybody knew?
UNK: -You know what? I'm back in the club! -Yeah!
UNK: -Shall I call the meeting to order? -Is everybody present?
UNK: With the exception of Ta-Taka.
Phoebe : -I wanna join! -Phoebe?
UNK: I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club. I didn't go to high school.
Phoebe : But three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French.
UNK: Fine, you can have your stupid, little club.
UNK: But what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you.
UNK: -You gave me a teeny weenie. -Yeah!
UNK: You're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor..
Monica : you were one of the most popular girls. Everyone wanted to be like you.
Monica : One girl wanted to be like you so much, she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: And Ross, if it weren't for her rumor, no one would've known who you were.
Monica : -She put you on the map. -As a romancer of the elderly.
UNK: Mrs. Altmann, you can tell, she used to be pretty.
UNK: The eyes did still sparkle.
UNK: This stuff is so way in the past. You've been through so much since then.
UNK: You got so much more important stuff going on in your life.
UNK: Can't you just let this go?
UNK: -She's right. -We are having a baby together.
Will : Hold on.
Will : -You got her pregnant? -Yeah.
UNK: -Are you getting married? -No.
UNK: So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude.
UNK: -Anybody? -Okay.
UNK: It's exactly how I imagined it would be.
UNK: All right, where's that turkey?
Phoebe : -Those are my maternity pants! -No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!
UNK: Well, that's it. I'm done.
Joey : Here come the meat sweats.
UNK: Well, Joey, we're all very proud of you.
Chandler : I believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now.
Phoebe : -Anything we can do? -No. Just nobody press on my stomach.
Rachel : You can keep those pants, by the way.
UNK: What you got there? What is that, pie?
Monica : -Yeah. You want some? -Just cut me a little sliver.
Joey : Little bigger.
Joey : Little bigger.
UNK: Are you afraid you're gonna run out? Cut me a real piece!
