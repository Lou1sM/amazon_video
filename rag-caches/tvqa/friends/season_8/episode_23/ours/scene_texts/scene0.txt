Ross : All right!
Ross : Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it.
Rachel : Yes, the hard part is truly over.
UNK: No, but come on, we're off to a great start, aren't we?
UNK: I knew I'd get here fast, but this has gotta be some kind of a record!
Phoebe : -Oh, you made it! -Hi.
Ross : -How the hell did you beat us here? -We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Ross : No, we took a cab too. But I did test runs..
Joey : Hey, you made it!
UNK: Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
Rachel : Ross, you stay here and talk. I'm gonna go have a baby.
UNK: Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene. I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
Nurse : Right. We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you, so..
UNK: Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private? We asked for a private room.
Nurse : Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
UNK: -And, currently, they're all unavailable. -Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
UNK: I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Rachel : Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
UNK: Yeah?
Rachel : -Give her some money. -I really think they're out of rooms.
UNK: They're not, Ross. They're just saving them for important people!
UNK: Okay? What if I was the president?
UNK: Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble. You don't know where any countries are.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Say, would you mind checking again?
UNK: See if any private rooms may have opened up?
Nurse : This is a hospital.
UNK: Okay, I see. Could we please talk to the manager?
UNK: There is no manager.
UNK: Just nurses, doctors and semi-private rooms.
UNK: Okay, you know what? I have to say, I don't really care for your tone.
Rachel : And this is not the only hospital in this city, and we have no problem.. Oh, gosh!
Ross : -What? What? -Contraction!
Nurse : -Would you like to see a semi-private room? -Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
UNK: Oh, wait, Dr. Long. Can I ask you something?
UNK: Is labor really as painful as everybody says it is?
UNK: Oh, look at that. My beeper's going crazy.
UNK: Hey, don't.. You know what? You're gonna be fine.
Rachel : -I guess we have some time to kill. -Yeah, guess so.
UNK: Oh, check these out.
Ross : Never done this before.
UNK: Doesn't feel good.
Rachel : Yeah, well, it looks great.
Man : Thank you very much. I think we're ready to..
