UNK: I am sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
UNK: Oh, that's very.. Really, very, very okay.
UNK: Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters. That's about four fingers!
Marc : -Doctor let me feel it myself. -Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
UNK: -No, I don't.. We're not gonna do that. -We won't be doing that.
UNK: Well, if you like, you could feel Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : -Am I interrupting? -Yes! Thank you! Later.
UNK: -No, you can't leave me alone with them. -Oh, I'm sorry.
Rachel : No, Ross? Ross? Ross? My child has no father!
UNK: I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I wish you'd called first.
UNK: That's all right. I'm coming back later with your father.
UNK: -I needed to talk to you before the birth. -Okay. What's up?
UNK: Ross, I want to talk to you as your mother..
UNK: even though I know that you and I are also very close friends.
UNK: I really don't know what you're talking about, but okay.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : I brought something that I want to give you.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Assuming, of course, that you want it.
UNK: Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
UNK: This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
Ross : -Mom, no. Come on. Thank you. -Just hear me out..
UNK: No! Okay? We've been through this.
UNK: We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
UNK: Honestly, Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
UNK: You think young people use that word more than we actually do.
UNK: Ross, a child should have a family.
UNK: You know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
UNK: Go.. Hey, go talk to Monica.
UNK: She got a new haircut. You'll hate it.
UNK: Just think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
Rachel : Give me.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : -Hi, dear. -Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Rachel : Ross, get in here!
UNK: You wanna see something funny?
UNK: Monica.
UNK: Okay. All right, stop it. You're freaking me out.
UNK: Do it again. Do it again.
UNK: Hey, Rachel had the baby.
UNK: -What? -Really?
UNK: No.
UNK: I don't know why I thought that'd be funny.
UNK: You said hi to Mom before she left, right?
UNK: I thought that was her.
UNK: Yeah, I called her name, and she ducked into a stairwell.
UNK: Well, you know what? Consider yourself lucky.
UNK: She pulled me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
Cliff : -Oh, my God. -How annoying.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: -Why aren't you with Rachel? -You're kidding, right?
UNK: Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
UNK: And I know she's not just some girl I humped..
UNK: Oh, humped?
UNK: Come on, Ross.
UNK: But it just seems that you two belong together.
UNK: Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Phoebe : Right. And with who again?
UNK: He's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
Phoebe : I know.
UNK: Seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean, I know she turned me down..
UNK: but if she hadn't and she wanted to be with me..
Joey : I would take her in my arms and..
UNK: I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I?
