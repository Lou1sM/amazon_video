UNK: Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
UNK: Oh, no, not at all. It's okay. Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
UNK: -Hi, Julie. This is Rachel. -Oh, hi, Rachel.
Julie : -Is this your first? -Yeah, it is.
Julie : Well, little Jamie here is our third.
UNK: So if you have any questions, or you need anything at all, just holler.
UNK: -That's so sweet. -Yeah.
Ross : -Let me give you guys some privacy. -Nonsense. We're all in this together.
UNK: We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
UNK: -I think we're gonna have some fun. -Yeah.
UNK: -Oh, okay, I guess. -Hey, smile!
UNK: -I don't know if.. -I really don't want any..
Rachel : Oh, thank you.
Rachel : Oh, Ross! Here comes another contraction.
Ross : Okay, just breathe.
UNK: -Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too! -Oh, my God!
UNK: Hey, look at this.
Ross : -Here you go! -Oh, no!
Phoebe : Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
Phoebe : The miracle of birth sure is a snooze-fest.
Monica : -Hey, you wanna see something? -Sure. What?
UNK: This is gonna be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler.
UNK: -Honey? -Yeah?
UNK: Listen, I've been doing some thinking..
UNK: and I don't know whether it's because we're here..
UNK: or Rachel's giving birth..
UNK: but I think we should try to have a baby.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: What's that now?
UNK: Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I think we're ready.
UNK: Are you kidding? You think we're ready to have a baby now?
Phoebe : This is fun.
UNK: You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
Chandler : You said you were ready too.
Monica : Yeah, but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird..
Monica : Like mine is now!
UNK: Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
UNK: Yeah, but no one ever wanted to have one with me. I mean..
UNK: Now I'm just gonna have a baby if I want to. Oh, what are you doing to me?
UNK: I'm sorry I brought it up.
UNK: Okay, then, back off, mister!
UNK: Because I am ready to have a baby.
Monica : I just want Joey to be the father.
Joey : -What? Are you crazy? -That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
