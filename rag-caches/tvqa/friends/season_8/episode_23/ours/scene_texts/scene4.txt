Chandler : -Period math? -Yeah.
Monica : Well, we could start trying now.
Chandler : -Right here? -No, not here.
Monica : Maybe here.
UNK: It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill, and we're in a building that's full of beds!
UNK: And it's so clean!
Joey : Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
Phoebe : -It ate your money? -No.
UNK: -I'll see you downstairs then. -All right.
Joey : Hey, I got one! I got one!
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
Man : -Oh, up or down? -Oh. Down, please.
UNK: I hate to be a ball-buster, but can I just do it?
Man : -Could you press up too? -Sure.
UNK: -I feel bad. I broke my leg once too. -Yeah? How'd yours happen?
UNK: Well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
UNK: Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
Phoebe : -How about you? -Car accident.
Man : Some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
Man : Yeah. Me.
UNK: -Sorry. -Oh, no. No, don't be.
UNK: Nobody else got hurt. And I was pretty lucky.
UNK: Well, I, for one, am glad you made it.
UNK: Are you sure? I mean, you don't know me.
UNK: I could have been sent from another planet to destroy Earth.
UNK: Couldn't press the "down" button. I think Earth's okay.
UNK: Oh, hey, that's me.
UNK: Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.
UNK: Well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else..
UNK: Yeah, I would like that.
UNK: -Great. I'm in room.. -Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!
Joey : You gotta press the button.
Ross : The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
UNK: Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
UNK: She doesn't need to be. She'll still have the baby before I do.
Rachel : -Oh, Ross! Another contraction. -Oh, okay. Here, here.
UNK: That's it.
Woman : -Oh, that sounded like a bad one. -Yeah, it was.
UNK: Mine haven't been so bad. Oh, here comes one now.
Woman : Oh, that was a big one.
UNK: That was, like, the biggest one yet. Are you okay, honey?
UNK: I'm okay, honey.
UNK: Well, I got some bad news. It gets worse.
UNK: And when you get to the end, they get really big..
UNK: and they come, like, every minute.
UNK: Well, mine are pretty close together. I think..
Phoebe : -Excuse me. -Yeah, that's quite all right.
UNK: Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna. What's yours?
