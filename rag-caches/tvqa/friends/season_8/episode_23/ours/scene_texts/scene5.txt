Phoebe : Excuse me, could you help me with something?
UNK: I'm looking for a man.
UNK: Well, who isn't?
UNK: You. You aren't.
UNK: Good for you.
UNK: Anyway, the patient I'm looking for has a broken leg.
UNK: He's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid-30s, very attractive.
UNK: Even you would think so.
UNK: -I know who you're talking about. -Great! What room number is he in?
UNK: I'm sorry. Patient information is confidential.
UNK: No, I'm not gonna bother him. We were talking earlier..
UNK: Ma'am, I'm sorry. That information is restricted to hospital staff.
UNK: -She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray. -Dr. Drake who?
UNK: Ramoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information. I'm a doctor.
Nurse : -A doctor at this hospital? -Damn it, we're losing precious time.
UNK: You want this man's blood on your head..?
UNK: -Hands. -Hands!
Joey : It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room he is staying in.
UNK: He's a patient of mine. I've treated him for years.
UNK: -He's in room 816. -816. Thank you.
Joey : -And what is his name? -No.
Monica : -I think we found a place. -Okay.
UNK: Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
UNK: Hello, Monica.
UNK: -Not like that. -Oh, okay.
UNK: -We'll dim the lights. -Okay.
UNK: Or turn them out altogether.
Chandler : No scented candles. Okay, here. There we go.
Ross : Okay, okay. Making me sterile, but okay.
UNK: Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait. Do we have a condom?
Monica : Oh, right!
UNK: Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
Phoebe : This is it!
UNK: -That's him! -Great. Go get him!
Phoebe : Wait a second. Or maybe you could go in first.
UNK: He's not really my type.
UNK: Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him questions and see what he's like.
Phoebe : -People tell doctors everything. -You said he was this great guy.
UNK: All the guys I meet seem nice at first, then turn out to be big jerks.
Joey : -You do attract some stinkers. -Yeah, I know.
UNK: Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.
Rachel : Three women have come and gone with their babies.
UNK: You gotta give me good news. How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
UNK: -Three. -Just three?
UNK: I'm dilated three!
UNK: Dr. Long : We are moving along just slowly. Don't worry, you're doing great.
UNK: -I'll be back soon. -Thank you.
UNK: You know what? I'm not waiting. I'm gonna push this baby out.
UNK: I'm doing it. Three centimeters. That's gotta be like this, right?
UNK: -Actually, it's more like this. -Oh, stupid metric system.
UNK: We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
