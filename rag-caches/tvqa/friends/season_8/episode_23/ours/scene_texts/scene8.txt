Phoebe : A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
UNK: I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
UNK: Because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.
UNK: -Oh. Somebody went to college. -Yeah.
UNK: Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
UNK: I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
UNK: Oh. I'll get it.
UNK: I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.
UNK: Relax. It's not like we're forking.
UNK: When. When.
UNK: Thank you. Listen.
UNK: You seem to really know what to do with a utensil.
UNK: Would you like to go to dinner sometime?
UNK: -Yeah, I'd really like that. -Yeah?
UNK: Yeah. And I promise I won't make you eat any remarkable animals.
Rachel : I was thinking..
UNK: I'd kind of like to make a move.
UNK: But, you know, with the leg.
Man : Oh, yeah.
UNK: Maybe a little help.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Let me fix your pillow.
UNK: Cliff, you're so forward.
UNK: Oh, it was really nice meeting you.
UNK: Sid!
UNK: That's the first time I heard her voice.
UNK: I didn't care for it.
UNK: Oh, that's five, Ross. Five women have had five babies..
Rachel : and I have had no babies.
UNK: Why doesn't she want to come out?
UNK: You know what I think it is? I think you made such a nice home for her..
Ross : over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Rachel : Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
Rachel : -Oh, God. -Okay. Okay.
UNK: Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
Rachel : Doctor, you gotta do something! Get me drugs..
UNK: or light a fire up in there and just smoke it out!
UNK: Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
UNK: What?
UNK: Dr. Long : Ten centimeters. You're about to become a mom.
UNK: Oh, my God. Okay.
UNK: Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
Cliff : Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
Chandler : You know what?
Phoebe : This one is.
UNK: Oh, my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before.
UNK: Well, it must be one of those closed-circuit hospital channels.
UNK: No, no. That's a soap opera.
UNK: This is a very dramatic hospital.
UNK: I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here..
Cliff : asking me all these weird questions.
UNK: Okay, Mr. Percocet.
UNK: I swear to you, that's the guy.
UNK: Okay, Cliff.
Phoebe : Do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
UNK: What probably happened was you were watching this, you drifted off to sleep..
UNK: and you dreamt he was here.
UNK: Rachel's having her baby!
Joey : Which is of no interest to me as a neurologist. I..
UNK: That's him! You know him?
UNK: Wake up, Cliff!
Monica : What is going on?
UNK: Okay. Okay. I.. Okay.
Phoebe : I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.
