UNK: And yet, somehow, it's true.
Janice : I mean, this is so great. We're gonna be baby buddies!
Ross : Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears.
Man : -Hi, sweetie! -Hi, sweetheart.
UNK: This is my husband, Sid. I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.
Janice : I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office.
Janice : Thank God for adult acne!
UNK: I still can't believe it. I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
UNK: Really?
UNK: What'd he say?
Janice : You have to speak very loudly, he's almost completely deaf.
Ross : -Oh, there you go. -Of course he is.
Janice : Congratulations, you two. I didn't even know you got married.
UNK: -Oh, we didn't. -What?
UNK: We're just having this baby together, but that's all, you know.
UNK: Why?
UNK: We're just not in that place, you know? But we're very excited about this.
Janice : Oh. Well, then shut me up.
Rachel : Just tell me how.
Janice : Oh, I feel another one coming.
Ross : Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.
Phoebe : -What else? What else? -He's 33.
Cliff : A widower.
UNK: He seemed like a standup guy. And he's not into anything weird sexually.
UNK: Enter Phoebe!
UNK: Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
UNK: We could. Or we could have sex in it.
Chandler : Well, let me think about that while I remove my pants!
Monica : Okay, mister! Fertilize me!
Monica : Does that sound like Janice?
UNK: If it's not, then there's two of them.
Chandler : And that would mean it's the end of the world!
UNK: Hey.
UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
UNK: I can't believe this is taking so long. How you doing?
UNK: Not bad. You know that feeling, trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
UNK: And soon someone will call her "Mom."
Chandler : Weirdest thing. Did I hear..?
UNK: Mother of God, it's true!
Janice : Chandler Bing!
UNK: Janice.
Ross : Not just Janice. Janice in labor. Contracting and everything.
Janice : Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis.
Janice : You remember, Chandler.
Phoebe : I feel so bad for you.
UNK: She's your ex. And I have Richard.
UNK: Janice, I didn't even know you were pregnant.
UNK: Who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?
UNK: It's you.
Janice : This is yours.
UNK: What?
Janice : Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
UNK: That's funny. Does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
UNK: Okay, I've got one for you. If you had to, which would you eat?
