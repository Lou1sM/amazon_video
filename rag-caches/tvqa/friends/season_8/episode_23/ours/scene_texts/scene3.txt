UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
UNK: -Who's that? -New people.
Ross : What happened to the Disgustingtons?
UNK: They're having their baby. It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
Rachel : Right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
UNK: Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie crowning away.
Ross : Wow. Sorry.
Ross : So how are the new people?
Rachel : Well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
UNK: Including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard."
UNK: -Oh, gosh, a contraction. -Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
UNK: Evil Bitch : -Are you looking at her? -No!
UNK: -Don't you look at her, you sick bastard! -Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
UNK: She's in labor. You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
UNK: I'm just gonna..
UNK: See? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
UNK: No, no. I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
UNK: Evil Bitch : You miss your girlfriend?
Ross : Just ignore them.
Rachel : -You okay? -Yeah.
UNK: -Ross. -What?
UNK: -He's looking at me. -Hey!
Ross : You wanna live to see your baby?
UNK: Don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
Monica : Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
UNK: Oh, don't worry. These babies are far too ugly for us.
Monica : What is going on with you. Since when are you so crazy about babies?
UNK: I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
UNK: What?
UNK: We've always talked about having babies someday, not now..
UNK: but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good.
UNK: We're really good.
Monica : We are pretty good.
Chandler : But nothing has to happen until you're ready.
UNK: Well, maybe I'm ready now.
UNK: I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
UNK: What? It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!
UNK: -What? -I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
UNK: So we're gonna try? I mean, we're trying?
UNK: We're trying to get pregnant.
UNK: I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
Chandler : -So when do you want to start trying? -All right, hold on a sec.
