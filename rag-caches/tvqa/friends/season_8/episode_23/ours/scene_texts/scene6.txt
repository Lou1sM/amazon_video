Rachel : Oh, for the love of God!
UNK: It's coming! It's coming!
Doctor : And here it is!
Rachel : Oh, come on!
UNK: I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
UNK: Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
UNK: I know. I'm a neurologist. Just to be on the safe side..
Joey : Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview. So he sent me.
Man : Dr. Wells is a woman!
Joey : That was a test. Good response.
Joey : -All right. Full name? -Clifford Burnett.
Joey : -Date of birth? -November 16, 1968.
UNK: Age?
UNK: -Can't you figure that out? -I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
UNK: -I'm 33. -Okay.
Joey : -And are you married? -No.
UNK: Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would you say you have commitment issues?
Cliff : Are all the questions this personal?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
UNK: -Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry. -Yeah.
UNK: I lost my wife five years ago to a mild cardial infarction.
UNK: -A heart attack, doctor. -Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, mild car..
UNK: Are you experiencing any dizziness?
UNK: No.
UNK: -Has the pain been getting worse? -No.
Joey : Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
UNK: -No. -Excellent. Excellent.
Joey : And finally, are you into any weird stuff, you know, sexually?
UNK: -No! -Wrong answer.
UNK: -This room's available. -Okay! Wait, you listen to me!
Rachel : Since I have been waiting, four women..
UNK: that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters I'm dilated..
Rachel : have come and gone with their babies. I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.
UNK: If you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, I will sue you.
UNK: Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you. My husband is a lawyer.
UNK: -Rach? -You get back on that case, honey!
UNK: I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Rachel : Okay. Well, then bring her in.
Cliff : Oh, my God!
UNK: I can't believe this!
