Janice : Sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Rachel : Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.
UNK: I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.
UNK: They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
UNK: -That's never gonna happen with Ross. -That's what I thought.
UNK: I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father..
Rachel : and little Miss New Boobs.
UNK: Really?
Janice : I hate to be the one to say it..
UNK: but, honey, you two are on your own.
UNK: Well, that's.. You know, that's..
UNK: We've been alone for the last 20 minutes and we're doing okay.
UNK: Maybe we won't be alone.
UNK: Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.
UNK: And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?
UNK: So it might be the beginning of something.
Ross : -Hey, Janice. -Oh, hi.
UNK: Who's this little guy?
Janice : -Aaron, your future son-in-law. -Oh, no, no.
UNK: No.
UNK: -I'm gonna leave you three alone. -Okay.
UNK: Man, you see the kid on that nose?
UNK: You know what I was thinking about?
Rachel : That kiss before we left the apartment. That was something, huh?
Ross : Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
UNK: But we.. We gotta be careful.
UNK: We.. You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?
UNK: Right.
UNK: -We don't want to go down that road. -No. That's why I brought it up.
UNK: -They didn't have any sodas? -Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
Ross : I was talking to this nurse. Completely forgot.
Rachel : And so it begins.
Phoebe : She in there?
UNK: Yeah. She's putting her down now. That's her.
UNK: Isn't it amazing how every baby is beautiful?
UNK: Except that one.
UNK: What is this? A petting zoo?
UNK: Look. Look at Emma.
UNK: I can't decide who she looks like, you or Rachel.
Ross : Oh, what, are you kidding? She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
UNK: I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
Phoebe : No, I know. Because you're not in that place.
Phoebe : Which would be fine, except you totally are.
UNK: It's complicated, okay?
UNK: Yeah, that's true.
Phoebe : You love her, you always have, you have a child together.
UNK: There's no right answer.
UNK: Look, we've been together. Then apart. Then together, then apart.
Ross : And now we have a baby.
UNK: It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out..
Ross : I could never do that to Emma.
UNK: I mean, she came into this world thinking everything.. Now me.
Ross : What, do they put something in the water here?
UNK: It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well now.
UNK: I know. If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.
Ross : -Yeah, exactly. -Right.
Phoebe : Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: I saw a woman breast-feeding twins at the same time.
Joey : It is like a freak show up here.
UNK: -What's the matter? -Nothing.
Joey : What is it? Hey.
UNK: -Really, it's nothing. I'm.. -Rach, come on. What?
UNK: I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Joey : What are you talking about? What about Ross?
UNK: Please. He'll be with his real family. The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
Joey : Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
UNK: I'm just saying that, you know..
Rachel : someday Ross is gonna meet somebody..
UNK: and he's gonna have his own life.
UNK: Right?
Joey : Yeah, I guess so.
UNK: I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
UNK: That's pretty dumb, huh?
UNK: Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
Joey : You are never, ever gonna be alone.
Joey : Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.
UNK: Joey. Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?
UNK: You don't have to worry about that, okay?
UNK: Could you grab me my other box of tissues?
UNK: -They're under Ross' coat. -Sure.
Cliff : Oh, my God!
UNK: Joey?
Cliff : Oh, my God.
UNK: Okay.
