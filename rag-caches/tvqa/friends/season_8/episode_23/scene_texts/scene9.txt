UNK: If it.. You know, if it helps, you came off great.
UNK: A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
UNK: I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was a fake doctor?
Joey : Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
UNK: -You tried making me think I was crazy? -That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
UNK: It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just start over?
UNK: I don't think so.
UNK: If I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
UNK: Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.
Joey : She was married to a gay ice dancer.
Joey : She gave birth to her brother's triplets.
Joey : Her twin sister used to do porn.
UNK: -We're trying to dial down the crazy. -Right.
UNK: We don't really know each other, so it'd be easy to forget about this..
UNK: but there's something between us. I don't know about you..
UNK: but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
UNK: -It doesn't happen to me either. -Me neither!
UNK: -The baby! Rachel! -Right, right!
UNK: Oh, I love this scene.
UNK: Okay, look. I gotta go too.
UNK: But.. What do you say? Can we just have that dinner?
UNK: The triplets.
UNK: You and your brother didn't..?
UNK: No! No, they implanted embryos.
UNK: -Then dinner sounds great. -Great! Okay.
UNK: All right, then I'll see you later.
UNK: Our friend's having a baby.
UNK: -Her own? -Oh, yeah. Yeah.
UNK: No, she's really old-fashioned.
UNK: Push. Push. We're gonna push for five more seconds.
UNK: Five, four..
UNK: Three, two, one! Oh!
UNK: Dr. Long : The next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.
