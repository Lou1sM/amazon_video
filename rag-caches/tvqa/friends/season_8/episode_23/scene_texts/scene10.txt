UNK: -I can't push anymore! -You're doing great.
Rachel : Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
UNK: Dr. Long : Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
Ross : -Come on. -Push. Wait.
UNK: Dr. Long : -I see something. -What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
UNK: -Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?! -What is that?
UNK: The baby's buttocks. She's breech.
Ross : -I thought she had two heads. -Oh, God!
Rachel : Is she gonna be okay?
UNK: -She's gonna be fine. -Okay.
UNK: She's in a more difficult position, so you have to push harder now.
UNK: -Okay. -That's it. Push. Push.
UNK: You're gonna have to push even harder.
UNK: -I'm sorry, I can't! I can't! -Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
UNK: I had no idea. Please, you do it for me!
UNK: Let's go. One more time. One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
UNK: Good.
UNK: Dr. Long : Keep pushing!
Rachel : Are you okay?
Ross : You have no idea how much this hurts.
Ross : Keep going! Keep going!
Marc : Here we go!
UNK: She's upside down, but she's coming!
Rachel : -Oh, God! -Oh! Oh, my God!
UNK: Oh, my God, she's here.
UNK: Oh, she's perfect.
UNK: Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.
UNK: -Where'd she go? -They're just wrapping her up.
Rachel : Okay. Well, be careful with her, she's really tiny.
UNK: Dr. Long : Here she is.
UNK: Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
Rachel : I know. Oh.
UNK: She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
UNK: Dr. Long : -Do we have a name yet? -No, not yet.
UNK: That's fine. For now we'll just call her Baby Girl Greene.
UNK: Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.
Rachel : Hello, Baby Girl.
Phoebe : -Can we come in? -Oh, come on in.
UNK: -Oh, there she is. -Oh, she's so beautiful.
UNK: Here.
UNK: Oh, my God. She's amazing.
UNK: Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex.
UNK: It's incredible. I mean, one minute she's inside you..
