Joey : She looks so real.
UNK: You know what I mean.
UNK: She's this whole tiny little person.
UNK: And she already has eyelashes and knees and..
UNK: -What? -Oh, no, no. It's okay.
UNK: For a second, I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand. So we're good.
Phoebe : -Okay, my turn. My turn. -Aunt Phoebe.
UNK: Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
Phoebe : Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
UNK: I won't.
UNK: -Honey, what's the matter? -Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
UNK: The doctor said it's normal, with all the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.
UNK: So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.
UNK: I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
Rachel : Oh, God.
UNK: -What's the matter now? -I was reliving it.
UNK: Do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
UNK: Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original.
UNK: Actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.
UNK: And you know what? I love them both. So just pick one, and that'll be it.
UNK: Wow, okay. Everyone..
UNK: this is Isabella.
UNK: -Hi, Isabella! -Hi.
UNK: What?
UNK: That's not her name.
UNK: I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
UNK: So then I guess Ferdinand is out.
Joey : -What was the other one? -Delilah.
Rachel : Oh, great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
UNK: So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
UNK: What are we gonna do?
UNK: -It's okay. You'll find a name. -Easy for you to say.
Ross : You already know what your kids' names will be.
Monica : -You do? -I had them picked out since I was 14.
UNK: Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?
Rachel : -Well, tell us, what are they? -Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
UNK: -And if it's a girl? -I don't wanna say.
UNK: Oh, stop. Tell us. We're not gonna want it.
UNK: Okay. It's Emma.
UNK: Emma.
UNK: See, I don't want it.
UNK: Do you have any other totally perfect names that you're not gonna use?
Man : -Take it. -What?
UNK: She's clearly an Emma.
Rachel : Oh, honey, but you love that name.
Monica : Yeah, but I love you more.
UNK: Besides, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed.
Monica : Hi, Emma.
UNK: Yep, that's you.
UNK: You're our little Em.
UNK: What's that, honey?
UNK: What?
Monica : Oh, you want a little cousin?
Monica : You want a cousin right now?
UNK: Do I look like a giant sperm to all of you, or..?
Chandler : -That was amazing. -I know.
UNK: Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?
UNK: We may have started our family. In nine months we could be here..
Monica : having our own baby.
Chandler : And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
UNK: I love you so much.
Man : -Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
UNK: You wanna do it again?
UNK: This time just for us?
UNK: Probably.
UNK: Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.
UNK: Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?
