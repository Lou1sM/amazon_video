Monica : Or this one!
UNK: -How are you? Got any morning sickness? -The guys don't know yet, do they?
UNK: Joey and Ross don't know anything. Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.
UNK: That's right. Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.
UNK: He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags.
Phoebe : I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.
Phoebe : After you, of course.
UNK: Don't worry. You only have to be pregnant for a few more hours..
UNK: because I'm telling the father today.
UNK: Is it someone in the building? That tall guy on the first floor?
UNK: -No! -What? I think he's cute.
Rachel : -Then you have his baby. -Believe me, I'm trying.
UNK: It's so weird. You're gonna tell this guy today..
Monica : and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
UNK: You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever.
UNK: You're like Ed McMahon, except without the big check.
Phoebe : Or the raw sexual magnetism.
UNK: Yeah, well, I guess it is pretty big news.
UNK: Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
UNK: He's just walking down the street thinking, "I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"
UNK: Then, bam! He's a father, everything's different.
UNK: It's only different if he wants it to be. I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
Phoebe : He still has this huge decision to make.
UNK: Now he's walking around thinking, "Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!
UNK: What was that "bam"?
UNK: I don't know. He's hit by a bus, or something.
UNK: Joey, what would you do if someone you slept with told you she was pregnant?
Joey : Who called here?
UNK: Did she sound blond? Did she have an accent? I gotta make a call.
UNK: Should have never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
UNK: It's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant.
Joey : Why would you scare me like that? What the hell's going on?
Joey : Is somebody pregnant?
UNK: Oh, yeah! That's me.
Joey : Oh, my God, Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
Phoebe : Yes, I am. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
UNK: -Wait a minute, who's the father? -You don't know him.
UNK: It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
UNK: Who is this guy? Because I will track him down and kick his ass!
UNK: -David Linn. -David Linn!
UNK: -Who's David Linn? -Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.
UNK: -Chandler? -Did you find the cameras?
Ross : -No. Did you? -Yes.
UNK: That's why I'm under the table, celebrating.
Ross : I checked in the lost and found. I talked to the manager. No one's turned them in.
UNK: Great. Those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today.
UNK: You just got married. Why is she so depressed?
Chandler : All my energy is going into not asking that question.
UNK: -I can't believe I screwed this up! -I'm sorry, man.
UNK: Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom.
UNK: There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed-up people.
Chandler : Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
UNK: No, I'm saying we buy more of these at the gift shop..
Ross : throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures.
UNK: We just have to make sure not to get anybody's faces.
