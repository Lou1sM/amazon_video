UNK: Listen, sir, for the last time, I don't care what the computer says.
Rachel : We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts from the minibar.
Rachel : And we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.
Phoebe : -Joey, were you in our room last night? -No.
Joey : I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill.
UNK: -We're checking out of the bridal suite. -That's right, I'm no longer a bride.
UNK: I'll never be a bride again. Now I'm just someone's wife.
UNK: And I'm the happiest guy in the world.
UNK: Honey, don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to.
Monica : Yeah, right.
Chandler : -We got the honeymoon. -That's not till Thursday.
Chandler : -The wedding pictures. -It won't be ready for weeks.
Chandler : Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
UNK: That's true. I knew I married you for a reason!
Chandler : Tell you what, I will go get them developed, and you can go home.
Chandler : -What? What did you take a picture of? -Nothing.
Joey : It was something.
Chandler : Ross has the cameras. Has he checked out yet?
Rachel : Are you joking? Checkout is not till noon.
UNK: -And he has a good 11 minutes left. -So?
UNK: So Ross had never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Rachel : One time, when we were dating, we got a late checkout.
Rachel : He got so excited, it was the best sex we ever had.
UNK: Until he screamed out "Radisson" at the end.
UNK: Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras and get them developed.
UNK: 32, Joe. You're 32!
UNK: -Here's a copy of your bill. -Thanks.
Monica : Champagne, strawberries..
UNK: Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night.
UNK: Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga Nut?
Chandler : Soaps, shampoos. Are you really taking all this stuff?
Ross : Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
UNK: Yeah, but you don't need.. What is this?
UNK: Thread.
UNK: Score!
Chandler : -Where are the disposable cameras? -What cameras?
UNK: -Last night I asked you to take them. -No, you didn't.
Chandler : Yes, remember? Right before we cut the cake, I said..
UNK: Yeah, you asked me if I could do you a favor.
UNK: Then my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.
UNK: Then you said, "Why is it called a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"
Ross : Then you did that, and my Uncle Murray looked at me like :
UNK: -So you don't have the cameras? -No, sorry.
UNK: So, what? They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
UNK: I'm sure they're here somewhere. I'll help you look.
UNK: -Great. -In three minutes.
Phoebe : Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
UNK: No! I'm just..
UNK: They're calling out to me. This little guy even crawled up in my lap.
UNK: Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present. What do you think it is?
Phoebe : A little mirror that, when you look into it..
Phoebe : you see yourself as an old woman.
Monica : A tiny salt shaker!
UNK: Oh, my God, for tiny salt!
Monica : Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun. That was fun.
UNK: Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler to open up the rest of them.
UNK: Although, you know, this is part of a salt-and-pepper set.
UNK: It may just count as only half a present. What do you think?
UNK: I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.
