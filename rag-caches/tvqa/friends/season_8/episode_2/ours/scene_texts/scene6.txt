Joey : I understand.
UNK: Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and lie down.
UNK: What? I proposed to you. It balances out.
UNK: I can't say that didn't hurt.
UNK: But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.
Joey : -Listen, about that, I only offered.. -Ooh, a Salami Buddy!
Joey : There you go!
UNK: -We're back! -Great.
UNK: We're hanging in the kitchen. Let's stay in the kitchen.
UNK: -It's picture time. -You're gonna love these.
UNK: Here's a picture of Ross.
UNK: And that's me.
UNK: And that's me and Ross.
UNK: And here's a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
UNK: Wow, that is a great picture. Yeah!
Monica : And interesting, because I found the cameras in one of our bags.
UNK: Didn't see that coming.
UNK: So this isn't a picture of our first kiss..
Chandler : but it is a picture of my first kiss with this lady.
UNK: Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure you'll remember, so there's no need..
UNK: -I'll take the real pictures to get developed. -Good idea.
Chandler : You opened all the presents without me? We were gonna do that together.
Monica : You kissed another woman?!
Chandler : -Call it even? -Okay.
UNK: -I'm gonna go get these in some water. -You stole those from that wedding?
UNK: No, the hotel lobby. They think they can charge me for some dirty movie..
Ross : and a bag of Mashuga Nuts, they got another thing coming!
Ross : Hey, my sweater!
UNK: I've been looking for this for, like, a month.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Monica : Oh, my God!
Ross : -Hey, how you doing? -Good. Long time no see.
Tag : -Like your sweater. -Right back at you.
UNK: -It's crazy about Rachel. -Well, she's one crazy lady.
Tag : -So whose is it? -I don't know, some Italian guy.
Ross : Come on, read your own label. See you later. He is so weird.
