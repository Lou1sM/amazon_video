Phoebe : Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before..
UNK: so I asked the father to meet you here so you could tell him.
UNK: What? Wait a minute. How do you even know who the father is?
Phoebe : I may play the fool at times..
UNK: but I'm more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.
Phoebe : I believe this belongs to the father of your baby..
UNK: Oh, God. He's in there right now?
UNK: You can turn around, or you can go rip the Band-Aid off. What do you want to do?
UNK: -Let's rip. -Are you sure?
UNK: -Phoebe! -Okay. Sorry.
Tag : Hey, Rach.
