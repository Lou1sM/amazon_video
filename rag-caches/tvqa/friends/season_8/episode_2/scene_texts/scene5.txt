UNK: Why don't you go up on-stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Ross : Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk?
Ross : Your car is about to be towed.
UNK: That's my car!
UNK: -A '95 LeSabre? -Yes.
Ross : -A green LeSabre? -Yes!
UNK: -I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre. -Yes, green-blue.
Ross : Well, go. Go move it!
Chandler : Ready for the last picture? Get ready to run.
Chandler : Congratulations on your wedding.
UNK: So, what's this about?
Phoebe : Rachel has something she wants to tell you.
UNK: And I believe that this is your red sweater.
UNK: No, this is my red sweater.
Phoebe : Oh, no.
Phoebe : Could I get anyone a coffee?
UNK: Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
UNK: What's going on, Rach?
UNK: Nothing. Phoebe kind of made a mistake.
UNK: But you do wear that sweater a lot. Are you involved in some kind of dare?
UNK: I'm actually glad Phoebe called.
Tag : I know we broke up because you thought I was immature, but I've grown up.
UNK: I think we should get back together.
UNK: It's just not the right time.
Tag : It is the right time. I'm ready for more.
Tag : Come on, Rach. Let's give it another try.
UNK: I'm having a baby.
Chandler : -You can go. -Thank you.
UNK: I don't know how any of these got opened!
Joey : -You opened them all? -I know, I am a terrible person.
UNK: Chandler's never gonna trust me with anything ever again.
UNK: You got my parents' gift.
Monica : -What is that? -I think it does something to salami.
UNK: -How'd it go? -What did Tag say?
Rachel : Tag is not the father. And Joey knows now?
Joey : I do, Rach, I do. And I am so happy for you.
UNK: Wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra.
Monica : -So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is? -I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
Joey : No matter what this guy says, you're not gonna be alone in this.
UNK: -I'm not? -No. Listen..
UNK: It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom.
UNK: I've always felt like you and I have this special bond, you know?
UNK: -Rachel Greene, will you marry me? -What?
UNK: -What? -What?!
Joey : -Pheebs, give me the ring back. -No!
UNK: Joey, you're so sweet, so sweet, honey. But I'm not looking for a husband.
