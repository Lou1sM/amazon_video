Chandler : Is it made of cheese?
UNK: No. A house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?
UNK: -I'd move in tomorrow! -Oh, come on!
UNK: -Listen to this! -I'm so sorry.
Chandler : -What do we do? -They both want a house of cheese.
UNK: I don't know how you fight that.
Joey : Okay, okay. I can do this. I can tell her how I feel.
UNK: Okay, stand up straight.
Joey : Take a couple deep breaths.
Joey : Look confident.
UNK: Joey? What's up?
UNK: I came by because I want to talk to you about something.
UNK: What's up?
Joey : Here, in the hall? What are we, animals?
UNK: I'm late for a meeting. Could you make it quick?
Joey : I just came by to tell you that..
UNK: I want to have dinner with you.
UNK: Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.
UNK: Okay. That's good.
UNK: That gives you a couple of hours to prepare.
UNK: Don't you people ever knock?
UNK: I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
UNK: Sure. Set it up.
UNK: I'll just be browsing through the personals.
Monica : Are you okay? You're acting weird.
UNK: Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.
Chandler : But good enough.
UNK: Jeez, what's with you?
UNK: I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?
UNK: -What's going on? -Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.
UNK: I don't believe in that, but you two get along.
UNK: I'll step aside if you wanna go with Don and live in a house of cheese.
UNK: -You don't believe in soul mates? -No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.
UNK: I don't believe in soul mates, either.
UNK: -You don't? -Nope.
UNK: We weren't destined to end up together.
Monica : We fell in love and work hard at our relationship.
Monica : Some days we work really hard.
UNK: So you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
UNK: No, I've had second thoughts. Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?
Chandler : -I love you. -I know.
UNK: I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
Chandler : I found this place that makes the greatest jalapeno poppers.
UNK: No? They taste so good.
UNK: It happens whenever Chandler touches my stomach.
