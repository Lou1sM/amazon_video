UNK: Seven, eight..
Rachel : Eight years. Wow.
Joey : A long time.
UNK: But over the past few weeks, I..
UNK: Okay! Sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here.
UNK: Our specials tonight..
Joey : -Could you give us a second? -Sure.
UNK: Second's up!
UNK: Not that kind of table.
Rachel : So you were saying?
UNK: I'm not sure.
UNK: You asked how long we knew each other, and I said eight years.
UNK: Then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half..
UNK: and now here we are.
Joey : Yeah. Here we are.
UNK: I think I'm falling in love with you.
UNK: What?
UNK: I'm falling in love with you.

UNK: Funny. It's funny!
UNK: I don't get it.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: Okay, so the specials are..
Chandler : Are you..?
Rachel : How did..?
UNK: When?
Joey : Does it really matter?
Rachel : Wow. Wow.
Rachel : It is hot in here.
Joey : I know this is a lot.
UNK: You don't have to say anything.
Joey : You take as much time as you need.
Joey : Okay, you gotta say something.
Rachel : Joey, I love you so much.
UNK: -But.. -But.
UNK: Joey?
UNK: Right. Hey, that's..
UNK: That's okay. That's fine.
UNK: It's pretty much what I was expecting.
UNK: It's no big deal, all right?
UNK: -I think I'm gonna go. -Please don't leave like this.
UNK: You can't do this to a pregnant woman!
UNK: Don't start doing that.
UNK: You can't do that, because you're gonna make me..
UNK: Oh, there we go!
Rachel : -Can I? -Sure.
UNK: Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose..
Monica : Hey, hey.
UNK: You can't, okay? Ever.
UNK: I'm so sorry.
UNK: Please don't be sorry.
UNK: Okay? Don't be sorry.
UNK: You know, I was only kidding.
Rachel : Yeah, that was a real good one.
UNK: Waiter No. 2 : -Is this your table? -Yeah.
UNK: -You'll be here all night. -I know.
UNK: I haven't even read the specials.
UNK: What's the matter?
UNK: I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying.
UNK: I kind of hope it's the girl.
Waiter : The guy is really cute!
