UNK: He's meant for her, and you're gonna date him?
Phoebe : He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
UNK: Rachel?!
UNK: I didn't know Joey was on JAG.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
UNK: I talked to Joey. I wanted to see you.
UNK: I still can't believe it. Joey and Rachel?
UNK: It's like you and me going out, only weirder.
UNK: I know you're hurting..
UNK: but don't say that again.
UNK: What if they marry? He'd be the stepfather of my child.
UNK: You don't need to worry.
UNK: He'll never tell her how he feels.
UNK: If he did, you don't know how she'd react.
UNK: Sure, women never like Joey. I think he's a virgin.
UNK: -He isn't thinking about going for her. -He's not?
UNK: All he's thinking about is how you're taking this.
UNK: It's freaking him out. He wants to move to Vermont.
UNK: -Why? -He wants to leave the country.
Monica : He thinks you hate him.
Monica : Hate him?
UNK: No, I don't hate him.
UNK: It's just, it's Rachel. You know?
UNK: I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you..
UNK: but I don't want you to lose Joey over it.
UNK: Right now, he needs to know that you're still his friend.
UNK: Okay, I'll talk to him.
UNK: I'd do it soon.
Monica : He just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
UNK: -Hi! -Hi.
Phoebe : -Chandler, Monica, this is Don. -Hello.
UNK: Hello, nice to meet you. How are you?
Phoebe : Soul mate.
UNK: -What are you guys doing? -We had lunch at Adriatica.
UNK: -What's with the sun-dried tomatoes? -I know! Is this 1985?
UNK: -That's what I said! Isn't it strange? -Not really.
UNK: What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?
UNK: On a barbecued-chicken pizza?
UNK: No?
UNK: -What restaurants do you like? -Octavio. 27-and-7.
UNK: -There's this place, Alessandro's. -Oh, my God! I'm the chef!
UNK: You're kidding! Your food is fantastic!
UNK: I want to talk about your menu. Anyone want coffee?
UNK: If you're talking about me, I'll go with you.
UNK: I'll have a mocha-ccino.
