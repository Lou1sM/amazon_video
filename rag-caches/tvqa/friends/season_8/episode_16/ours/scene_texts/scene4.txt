Joey : I understand if you came by to hit me. I deserve it.
UNK: No, I don't want to hit you.
Joey : What, then? Kick me?
UNK: No.
Joey : Bite me?
UNK: I don't want to do anything to you.
UNK: I just want to say I'm not mad at you..
Ross : and that I certainly do not hate you.
Ross : I just came here to say that.
UNK: Hey, wait, Ross?
UNK: You wanna come in for a beer or something?
Ross : Yeah, sure.
Joey : You got any beer?
UNK: All I got is melon stuff that Rachel left.
UNK: Okay.
Joey : You need to understand something.
Joey : I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay?
UNK: I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Ross : Thank you.
UNK: Anyway, it'll just..
UNK: It'll take me a while to get over her.
UNK: I'm not sure how to do that. I've never been in love, so..
UNK: What?
UNK: You're in love with her?
Joey : -Yeah. I thought you knew that. -No.
UNK: Look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way, honest.
Joey : I just keep thinking, "I'll get over this," you know?
UNK: But it just keeps getting harder.
UNK: I don't know what to do, you know?
Joey : What do I do?
Ross : -You need to tell her how you feel. -That's the green stuff talking.
UNK: I'm serious. You need to find out where she is.
UNK: If she's not where you are, you can start to move on.
Joey : But what if, and I'm not saying she will be..
Ross : If she is where you are..
Ross : then my feeling weird shouldn't stand in the way.
Joey : -Are you sure? -Yeah.
UNK: If she ends up with somebody else..
Ross : the truth is, she couldn't find a better guy.
Joey : Hey, thanks.
UNK: -So when are you gonna talk to her? -Oh, my God. I have to tell her.
UNK: I haven't thought about it. What should I say?
UNK: I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
Joey : What am I gonna say?
Ross : Yeah, tell me about it.
UNK: I'm phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese.
Chandler : Cheese, you say?
UNK: That's some pretty smelly work, huh, Don?
Don : -Excuse me? -Cheese. It's smelly.
Chandler : You must smell a lot of the time too.
UNK: Not really. But with cheese, I think the smellier, the better.
UNK: Me too! Chandler hates it. I can't have blue cheese in the house.
UNK: And you're still married to him?
