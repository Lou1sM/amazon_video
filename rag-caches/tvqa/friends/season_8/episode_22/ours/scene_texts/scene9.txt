Ross : Finish your enchilada.
UNK: Ross, we've tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Ross : Okay, here, have one of these peppers.
UNK: Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.
UNK: By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
Rachel : I am feeling nothing.
Rachel : Speaking of hot, watching you do that..
Rachel : really makes me want to have sex with you.
Monica : -Stop it. -Come on! Why are we wasting time?
UNK: We know it's gonna work. It's doctor-recommended.
UNK: I'm sorry. But we have to have some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.
UNK: We've done it before. We'll do it again.
UNK: It'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
UNK: I'm not gonna make love to you so you'll go into labor.
Rachel : Make love? What are you, a girl?
Ross : Always a great way to get into a man's pants.
Rachel : You'll be performing a service. Think of me as a ketchup bottle.
Rachel : Sometimes, you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out.
