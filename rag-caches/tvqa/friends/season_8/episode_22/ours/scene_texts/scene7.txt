UNK: Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!
Joey : -You liked it? You really liked it? -Oh, yeah!
UNK: -Well, which part exactly? -The whole thing! Here we go!
UNK: No, no, no. Give me some specifics.
UNK: I loved the specifics. The specifics were the best part.
Joey : Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did you like that part?
Chandler : I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Joey : You fell asleep!
UNK: There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions!
UNK: -I can't believe you fell asleep. -I can't believe it either.
UNK: Maybe it didn't happen.
UNK: Maybe you fell asleep and dreamt the whole thing.
UNK: And this conversation we're having right now is part of that dream.
UNK: Wake up, Joe!
UNK: -Thanks for coming. See you later. -Don't go. I'm so sorry.
Chandler : Look, this guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
Chandler : Or call an ambulance!
Monica : What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
