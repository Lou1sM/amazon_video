UNK: No. She gave us ideas on how to induce labor.
Ross : We tried them all.
UNK: We went for a walk, we tried tea, castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.
UNK: There is one thing we didn't try.
Rachel : But someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.
UNK: If it's gonna help bring the baby here, today..
Monica : I think you should do it.
UNK: -It's sex. -Do it!
UNK: -Monica. -It's been a really long time for you.
Monica : I mean, women have needs. Do it. Get yours.
UNK: Oh, I don't know about that.
UNK: I think if the two of you had sex, the repercussions would be catastrophic.
UNK: All right, let's be practical.
UNK: If Ross isn't willing, he's not the only guy you can have sex with.
UNK: You could borrow Chandler. Chandler is good.
UNK: Okay, okay. Yeah, I don't think I wanna do that.
UNK: You sure? I'm just saying..
UNK: the baby's head isn't getting any smaller.
Ross : Monica, what is the matter with you?
Monica : -I just want the baby to be born today. -Why today?
Monica : Okay, fine.
UNK: I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby, and I don't want to lose.
UNK: What? While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?
UNK: You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?
UNK: -I'll take that bet. -What?
UNK: I'm miserable. I may as well make some money out of it.
Ross : Can I get some of that action?
UNK: I'm betting against all of you?
UNK: I really feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Sixty, 80, 100.
UNK: And 50.
UNK: And two.
UNK: Yeah, baby.
Joey : Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
UNK: Where have you been? I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.
Joey : Oh, no. Were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
UNK: I'm so sorry.
UNK: The reason I came over is to settle things between us. You've done a lot for me.
Joey : I wanted to pay you back with the premiere, but you missed it.
Joey : -So how much do I owe you? -What?
UNK: -I don't want to owe you anything. -You don't owe me.
UNK: -I don't want your.. -We're doing this!
UNK: You got me my first headshots. How much?
UNK: -I don't know, $500. -Okay, $500. What else?
Chandler : Then there was the second set. The infamous "booger" headshots.
UNK: Okay, so that's another $500. That's 500 and 500. That's..
Chandler : -You want a calculator? -Please.
UNK: Here.
Joey : All right, what else?
UNK: Well, there's acting classes, stage-combat classes, tap classes..
UNK: Which we're still keeping under our hats.
Chandler : That dialect coach who helped you with a Southern accent.
UNK: Which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out Jamaican.
Joey : What the hell are you talking about? The South will rise again, man.
UNK: Yes, money well-spent.
Joey : Okay, what else? Rent.
Chandler : Two, three years of rent, utilities, food..
UNK: Okay, so I'm writing you a check for..
Joey : So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal, right?
Joey : How do you clear this thing?
