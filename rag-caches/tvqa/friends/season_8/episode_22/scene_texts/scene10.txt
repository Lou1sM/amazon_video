Ross : I love when you talk dirty to me.
UNK: I know it. You're right. That's not sexy.
Rachel : Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.
UNK: Let me just bend over and get it.
Rachel : Oh, God!
Ross : Okay, enough. This is not going to happen.
UNK: Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.
Rachel : Come on, you started this, now you finish it!
Rachel : Come on, wuss. Make love to me.
UNK: -You know what? -What?
Ross : Forget it.
Rachel : What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk?
Rachel : How on earth will you ever annoy me?
Rachel : Oh, wait a minute, I know.
UNK: You'd think the jalapeno would clear up your sinuses, but no!
UNK: That's not enough.. What are you doing?
UNK: I'm getting that baby out of you!
Rachel : -Oh, God! -I know.
UNK: Oh, no, no, no.
Rachel : I think my water just broke.
Ross : I am good!
Ross : Okay, I got the pillow. I got the bag.
Ross : -You got the keys? -I got the keys.
UNK: We're having a baby.
UNK: I didn't have time to read this part of the books, but do we have time..?
Ross : -Not so much. -Okay, let's go.
UNK: -200. -Thank you.
UNK: That's it. I don't care when the baby comes. No more betting.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: I guess we could bet one more time.
Phoebe : -Is Rachel having the baby? -How did you know that?
Monica : -Joey! Chandler! -They're at the coffee house.
Monica : You know everything!
UNK: Wait. I bet you the baby is over 7 pounds.
Monica : I bet you it has hair! I bet you it's a girl.
UNK: -We know it's a girl. -I'll give you really good odds.
