Phoebe : Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.
UNK: And you're still pregnant.
UNK: I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are.
UNK: You know what? You look great. Yeah, like 50 bucks.
Rachel : I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.
UNK: Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.
UNK: That's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
UNK: All right, stop it.
UNK: -Double or nothing she has it tomorrow. -Fine.
UNK: Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp.. right there?
UNK: -Rachel here? We have an appointment. -In the bathroom.
Ross : -Rach, we gotta go. -In a minute!
UNK: People ask why we're not together. I just don't know what to tell them.
UNK: All right, let's go.
Rachel : Oh, wait a minute.
UNK: Do I have to pee again?
UNK: No, I'm good.
UNK: Do you want to go change first?
UNK: The doctor's staying open late for us, but if you hurry..
UNK: -No, I'm fine. -You don't think that's inappropriate?
UNK: -What? -Good God, man. Don't anger it.
Rachel : Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am..
UNK: Fine. Whatever you want. You're the mommy.
UNK: No! Don't call me "Mommy."
UNK: It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
UNK: I'm actually with her on this one.
Rachel : Come on, Ross. We're gonna be late.
UNK: Either of you want to be Ross?
Joey : I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you.
UNK: Okay, this is it. This is my big fight scene coming up.
UNK: I'm fighting for every man in the 82nd Ground Division.
UNK: Ross? Can I ask you something?
Rachel : When Carol was pregnant with Ben..
Rachel : were you this irritating?
Rachel : -Excuse me? -Nothing. You're just..
UNK: You've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
UNK: Well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.
Ross : The doctor will be in soon. Why don't we not speak until then?
UNK: Okay.
Rachel : Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross. That's great.
UNK: We should ask the doctor if she even knows..
Ross : how to deliver a baby that's half human, half pure evil!
Rachel : -Hi, Dr. Long. How are you? -You're nice to her.
Rachel : She has the drugs.
UNK: We'll do a quick check.
UNK: Dr. Long : Eight days late, huh? You must be getting uncomfortable.
UNK: Yeah, just a tad.
UNK: You're 80% effaced. You're on your way. It still could last a while.
UNK: -There are ways to help things along. -Do them!
UNK: Actually, they're things that you can do. Home remedies.
