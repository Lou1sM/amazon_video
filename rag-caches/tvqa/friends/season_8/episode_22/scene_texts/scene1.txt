UNK: For those who haven't checked their calendars, today's my due date.
UNK: You should come. Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo.
UNK: That way for the first few moments of her life, she'll think we're really fancy.
UNK: I want to thank you guys for how great you've been during this.
UNK: I couldn't have done it without you. I loved these last 9 months.
UNK: I'm looking forward to the next part..
Rachel : I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
UNK: That's right. Still no baby.
UNK: What's the matter? Is the puffy, sweaty pregnant lady..
UNK: disturbing your precious coffee time?
UNK: Come on, people, make some room.
UNK: Sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here.
UNK: You.
UNK: Like you haven't done enough.
UNK: I know you're miserable. I wish there was something I could do.
UNK: I wish I were a sea horse.
UNK: Because with sea horses, it's the male. They carry the babies.
Ross : And then also, I'd be far away in the sea.
UNK: God.
