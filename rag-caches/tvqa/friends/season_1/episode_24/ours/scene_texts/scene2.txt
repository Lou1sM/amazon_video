UNK: We're doing presents first.
Monica : Hey, hold on there, tiger. How are you holding up?
Joey : Well, not so good. She thinks tonight we're gonna...
Joey : ...complete the transaction, if you know what And you do.
Monica : Have you ever thought about being there for her?
Joey : What do you mean?
UNK: You know, just be there for her.
Joey : Not following you.
Monica : Think about it.
UNK: Okay. I'm guessing this is from....
Rachel : -Thank you, Melanie. -This one right here is from me.
UNK: Okay. It's light. It rattles.
UNK: It's...
Rachel : ...Travel Scrabble!
Rachel : Thank you.
Rachel : This one's from Joey.
UNK: It feels like a book, I think it's a book. And it's a book!
Phoebe : It's Dr. Seuss!
UNK: That book got me through some tough times.
UNK: There's a little child inside this man.
Chandler : The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Rachel : -Who's this from? -From Ross.
Rachel : Oh, my God! He remembered!
Phoebe : -Remembered what? -lt was months ago.
UNK: We walked by this antique store. I saw this pin.
UNK: I told him it was like one my grandma had when I was little.
Rachel : I can't believe he remembered!
Chandler : Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Phoebe : It's so pretty! This must've cost him a fortune.
UNK: I can't believe it.
UNK: Remember when he fell in love with Carol...
Chandler : ...and bought her that expensive crystal duck?
Rachel : What did you just say?
Chandler : Crystal duck.
UNK: No, no, no. The "love" part?
Rachel : -Oh, my God! -Oh, no, no, no.
Joey : That's good. Just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Rachel : This is unbelievable. I mean, this is unbelievable!
Ross : I know. This is really, really huge.
Chandler : No, it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe : I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.
Chandler : Is there a mute button on this woman?
Monica : I think this is so great. I mean, you and Ross!
Monica : -Did you have any idea? -No, none!
UNK: My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out...
UNK: ... but nothing ever happened.
UNK: What else did he say? Does he wanna go out?
UNK: Given that he's in love with you...
UNK: ... he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee.
Rachel : Ross? All this time? I've gotta talk to him.
Chandler : -He's in China! -The country.
UNK: Is his flight gone?
UNK: Yes! He's watching a woman do this :
UNK: He's gone!
Monica : His flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.
UNK: -What about time difference? -From here to the airport?
UNK: -You'll never make it! -I've gotta try.
UNK: What'll you say to him?
Joey : -I don't know. -Then you shouldn't go.
UNK: Right. If you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.
UNK: But if it's good, tell him now.
Rachel : -Maybe I'll know when I see him. -All right, does this help?
UNK: No. Look, all I know is, I cannot wait a week. This is just too big.
