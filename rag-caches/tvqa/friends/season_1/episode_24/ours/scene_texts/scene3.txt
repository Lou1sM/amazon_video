Rachel : I've just gotta talk to him. Okay, I'll see you later.
Chandler : Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
UNK: All right.
Rachel : -Ross! Excuse me, pardon me. -Your boarding pass?
UNK: I need to talk to my friend.
UNK: Sorry, you're not allowed here without a pass.
Rachel : He's right there, in the blue jacket! Can l?
UNK: I'm sorry. Federal regulations!
Rachel : Then could you please just give him a message for me?
Rachel : -This is very important. -All right. What's the message?
Joey : I don't know.
UNK: Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir? I have a message for you.
UNK: Rachel loved the present. She'll see you when you get back.
UNK: What?
UNK: Toby, I don't know what she's talking about.
Man : There's no Rachel. Don't give me that deep freeze.
Melanie : Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
Melanie : I think I blacked out there for a minute.
UNK: It was nothing.
UNK: Well, now we gotta find something fun for you.
Joey : You know what?
Joey : Forget about me. Let's give you another turn.
Melanie : -Me, again? -Sure. Why not?
Melanie : Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!
Melanie : I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you'd be.
Joey : How do you mean?
UNK: I had you pegged as a guy who's always, "Me, me, me!"
Melanie : But you, you're a giver.
UNK: You're the most generous man I ever met.
Melanie : I mean, you're practically a woman.
UNK: -You're just saying that. -No.
Melanie : A woman!
UNK: -So? -I missed him.
UNK: -I'm so sorry. -That's too bad.
Chandler : Yeah, right.
UNK: No, I feel bad for her. I do.
UNK: I can think of somebody other than myself.
UNK: All right, I'm going to bed.
UNK: -Happy birthday. Hang in there. -Thanks.
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Pizza coupons.
UNK: Okay. You guys want help cleaning up this mess?
UNK: That'd be great.
UNK: So, Rach, you wanna save this wrapping paper?
Monica : Are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I throw it out?
Rachel : I don't know. I don't know.
Rachel : Thought about it all the way there...
Rachel : ...and I thought about it all the way back. You know, it's Ross!
UNK: You know what I mean? It's Ross.
UNK: -Sure! -Sure.
UNK: I don't know. This is just my initial gut feeling...
Rachel : ... but I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Monica : Oh, my God, me too! We'd be like friends-in-law!
UNK: The best part is you already know all about him.
UNK: You start on the 1 5th date.
UNK: But it would be like starting on the 1 5th date.
Monica : Another good point.
UNK: I mean, on the 1 5th date, you're already in a very...
UNK: ... "relationship-y" place. You're committed.
Phoebe : What happens if it doesn't work out?
Monica : -Why isn't it working out? -Sometimes it doesn't.
Monica : Is he not cute enough? Does he not make enough money?
Rachel : -No, I'm just -Maybe there's someone else.
UNK: -ls there someone else? -No, there is no one else.
UNK: Then why are you dumping my brother?
