Ross : Here's little Ben nodding off.
Monica : Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
UNK: -Look, he's got Ross haircut. -Let me see.
Rachel : Oh, God! Is he just the sweetest thing?
UNK: You must just wanna kiss him all over.
Ross : That would be nice.
UNK: -Pardon? -Nothing.
Chandler : Just a little extra air in my mouth.
Joey : Chan, can you help me out? I'll pay you back.
UNK: Right. Including the waffles last week, you now owe me...
UNK: ... 1 7 jillion dollars.
Joey : -Really, I'll pay you back this time. -Where's this money coming from?
UNK: I'm helping out at the NYU Med School with research.
Ross : What kind of research?
UNK: Just, you know, science.
UNK: Science.
Ross : Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Joey : It's a fertility study.
Monica : Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
UNK: Actually, a little more than that.
UNK: Thank you, God. This will bring us so much joy.
UNK: Come on, it's not that big a deal.
Joey : I just go down there every other day...
Joey : ...and make my contribution to the project.
Joey : But at the end of two weeks, I get $700!
Phoebe : You're gonna be making money hand over fist.
UNK: That's funny. Very funny.
UNK: This is great. I actually know somebody who loves what they do.
UNK: But what do you do to unwind after a tough day at work?
UNK: Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.
Phoebe : The ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys.
UNK: I just love barbecuing with you.
Chandler : Men are here!
Joey : We make fire.
Joey : Cook meat.
Chandler : Put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
UNK: Cute.
UNK: -Melanie called. She'll be late. -Okay.
UNK: How are things going? Is she becoming your "special someone"?
UNK: I don't know. She's pretty great.
Monica : What does she think of your little science project?
UNK: You think I'd tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Monica : Man's got a point.
Joey : The tough thing is, she really wants to have sex.
Chandler : Crazy bitch.
UNK: I got a week left to go. According to the rules...
UNK: ... I can't conduct personal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Monica : Joey, we always know what you mean.
Phoebe : How long did you think this barbecue would last?
Ross : -I'm going to China. -Jeez, you say one thing, and....
UNK: -China? -For the museum. Someone found a bone.
UNK: They don't want us to have it.
UNK: I'm going to try to persuade them. It's a whole big bone thing.
UNK: Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.
UNK: If you want to reach me, you can't. So here's my itinerary.
Ross : -Here's a picture of me. -Oh, let me see.
UNK: Could you show it to Ben every now and then so he doesn't forget me?
UNK: "Hi, Ben. I'm your father."
UNK: "I am The Head!"
UNK: This barbecue's gonna be very fun.
UNK: I wanted to wish Rachel a happy birthday before I left.
Monica : -She's out having drinks with Carl. -Hey, who's Carl?
Monica : That guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Phoebe : -There's this guy she met at -The coffeehouse? Right.
Phoebe : So you do know who he is.
UNK: I'll go say goodbye to the guys.
UNK: Hey, you know what? Tell them that bone story.
Ross : -I have to go to China. -The country?
Ross : No, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront.
UNK: Do you know who Carl is?
Chandler : Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore.... No.
Ross : Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
UNK: How can she, when she's never shown interest in you?
Chandler : -Forget about her. -He's right.
Joey : Please move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
UNK: Of course, there they just call it "food."
UNK: Yeah, I guess. I don't know.
UNK: All right, just give her this for me, okay?
UNK: We're looking out for you. We want you to be happy.
Joey : I may only have a couple beers in me, but I love you.
Chandler : I'm still on my first.
Chandler : I just think you're nice.
UNK: That's when we started this fruit basket business.
Melanie : We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers."
UNK: Like "The Three Musketeers," only with fruit.
