UNK: Hey, big Spender!
Joey : She's still asleep.
Chandler : -So how'd it go? -You know how you think you're great?
UNK: The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.
Joey : Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.
Joey : So I had to do all this other stuff.
Joey : And the response I got! Man, oh, man!
UNK: It was like a ticker-tape parade!
UNK: I know. My room's very, very close to the parade route.
Joey : It was amazing, and not just for her. For me too!
Joey : It's like, all of a sudden I'm blind...
Joey : ... but all my other senses are heightened.
Joey : It's like I was able to appreciate it...
Joey : ...on another level.
Chandler : -I didn't know you had another level. -I know. Neither did l!
UNK: Is something going on with O.J.?
Monica : Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?
Rachel : -From who? -You.
Rachel : I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Monica : Well, it's the thought.
UNK: Doesn't Ross'flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27B?
UNK: Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.
UNK: I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.
UNK: Why?
Rachel : I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him.
Rachel : I'd be going out with all of you. There'd be pressure
Monica : No pressure, no pressure!
UNK: Nothing has happened, and you're already so
UNK: I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy bit weird at first...
Monica : ... but I'll be good. I promise.
Rachel : -Who is it? -It's me, Carl.
UNK: -Come on up. -Behind my brother's back?
UNK: Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Joey : -Seven hundred bucks! -All right, you did it!
Chandler : Do we have any fruit?
Joey : Man, hell of a two weeks.
Joey : You know what? I feel I learned something.
UNK: You'll stick with this "all for her" thing?
Joey : What are you, crazy?
Joey : When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Carl : If I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr...
Carl : ...in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself!
Carl : I'm not against environmental issues, per se...
Carl : ...it's just that guy!
Ross : I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
UNK: Excuse me, I'm trying to have a date here.
Ross : Fine. Just stop thinking about me.
Ross : Can't do it, can you?
Rachel : I'm thinking about you. So what?
Ross : I don't get it. What do you see in this guy?
Rachel : Happens to be a very nice guy.
Carl : I mean, come on, buddy! Get a real car!
Ross : Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Rachel : Ross, it's too hard.
UNK: Why, because it'll get weird for everyone else? This is about us.
Ross : I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.
Rachel : You're like my best friend. If we broke up, and I lost you
UNK: What makes you think that?
Rachel : Have you been involved where you haven't broken up?
UNK: No.
Ross : But it only has to happen once.
Ross : You and I both know we are perfect for each other. Right?
UNK: So the only question is : Are you attracted to me?
Joey : I don't know.
Rachel : I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross : Well, start looking.
UNK: -Wow. -Exactly!
UNK: And I'm gonna be the guy...
Carl : ...caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Rachel : Right! You're right.
Joey : You know what?
UNK: I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.
Rachel : I am so sorry!
UNK: If you wanna finish your drinks, please do.
UNK: -I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry. -But....
UNK: -Where are you going? -To get Ross.
UNK: -My God, this is so exciting! -I know.
UNK: If you want the rest of my date, I'm not gonna finish it.
UNK: -Rachel, he's not a sandwich. -No, he's a banker with opera tickets.
UNK: Hello!
UNK: -Where you going? -Airport.
UNK: You can't tell him. There's so much I haven't done.
UNK: I haven't watched Baywatch with Yasmine Bleeth!
UNK: Chandler, relax. This is a good going to the airport.
UNK: Oh, well then fly, good woman, fly like the wind.
UNK: -I'm flying! -Tell him I'm the one who blew it!
UNK: Yes, another successful case for the love doctor.
Rachel : Excuse me! Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry.
UNK: Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?
Man : There's no Rachel!
Ross : Hey! I got that.
Julie : -Thanks, sweetie. -No problem.
UNK: I can't wait for you to meet my friends.
UNK: You don't think they'll judge me?
Ross : -No, they will. I just.... -Can't wait!
Ross : Come on, they're gonna love you.
