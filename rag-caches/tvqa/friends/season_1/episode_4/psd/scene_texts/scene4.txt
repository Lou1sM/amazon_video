Chandler : -Happy birthday, pal! -We love you, man.
UNK: It's funny. My birthday was seven months ago.
UNK: -So? -So you had an extra ticket...
Ross : ...and couldn't decide who got to bring a date?
Chandler : Well, aren't we Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?
UNK: Oh, my God! Is today the 20th? October 20th?
UNK: -I hoped you wouldn't remember. -What's wrong with the 20th?
Chandler : Eleven days before Halloween. All the good costumes are gone?
