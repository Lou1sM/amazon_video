Phoebe : No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Monica : Ah, the other Jack.
UNK: Right. He gave up something but then he got those magic beans.
Phoebe : And then he woke up and there was this big plant...
UNK: ...outside of his window, full of possibilities.
Phoebe : He lived in a village, and you live in the Village.
UNK: Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow. I gave up an orthodontist.
