Phoebe : If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace...
UNK: ...no hunger, good things for the rain forest.
Phoebe : And bigger boobs.
UNK: Well, see, you took mine.
Ross : What about you?
Phoebe : If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
UNK: There's always one guy. "lf I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "
All : Hey, Joey.
Monica : What would you do if you were omnipotent?

Monica : Excuse me?
Joey : If little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live.
Ross : Joey, omnipotent.
Monica : You are?
