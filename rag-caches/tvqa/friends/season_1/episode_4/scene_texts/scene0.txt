UNK: All right, Phoebe?
Phoebe : If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace...
UNK: ...no hunger, good things for the rain forest.
Phoebe : And bigger boobs.
UNK: Well, see, you took mine.
Ross : What about you?
Phoebe : If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
UNK: There's always one guy. "lf I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "
All : Hey, Joey.
Monica : What would you do if you were omnipotent?
Joey : Probably kill myself.
Monica : Excuse me?
Joey : If little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live.
Ross : Joey, omnipotent.
Monica : You are?
UNK: Ross, l' m sorry. I had no idea. I thought it was a theoretical question.
Monica : How does she do that?
UNK: I can't sleep in a public place.
UNK: Libraries, airplanes, movie theaters....
UNK: You slept at the Grand Canyon.
UNK: Hello, Mom and Dad never took us to the Grand Canyon.
UNK: Mom and Dad took us to the Grand Canyon?
Monica : Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
UNK: Yeah.
Phoebe : What? What? What?
UNK: -Hi. -It's okay. You just nodded off again.
Monica : What's going on?
UNK: I got no sleep last night. My grandmother has a new boyfriend...
Phoebe : ...and they' re both kind of insecure in bed, so And deaf.
UNK: They reassure each other that they' re having a good time.
Phoebe : You have no idea how loud they are.
Monica : -You can stay with Rachel and me. -Thanks.
UNK: 95, 96, 97. See, I told you.

UNK: -So? -So you had an extra ticket...
Ross : ...and couldn't decide who got to bring a date?
Chandler : Well, aren't we Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?
UNK: Oh, my God! Is today the 20th? October 20th?
UNK: -I hoped you wouldn't remember. -What's wrong with the 20th?
Chandler : Eleven days before Halloween. All the good costumes are gone?
UNK: T oday's the day Carol and I first...

UNK: Sex.
UNK: -You told your sister that? -Believe me, I told everyone.
UNK: I better pass on the game.
Ross : I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Joey : The hell with hockey! Let's all do that!
UNK: Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice! Guys' night out!
UNK: Come on, what do you say, big guy?
Ross : -What are you doing? -I have no idea.
UNK: -Come on, Ross. -Maybe it will take my mind off it.
UNK: -Promise to buy me a big foam finger? -You got it.
UNK: Look, look, look! My first paycheck!

UNK: I remember when I got my first paycheck.
UNK: There was a cave-in in a mine, and eight people were killed.
Monica : -You worked in a mine? -No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?
Rachel : Isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.
Rachel : And it was totally...
Rachel : ... not worth it.
UNK: What's FlCA? Why's he getting all my money?
Rachel : I mean, what? Chandler, look at that.
