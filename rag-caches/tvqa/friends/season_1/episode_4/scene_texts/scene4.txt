UNK: -You know who's kind of sexy? -Don't.
UNK: -Ross. -No, guys. Please, he is my brother.
UNK: I know exactly what you mean. He can be really smooth.
UNK: Can't you just picture him in bed?
UNK: I really don't want to.
UNK: Come on, laugh. Laugh.
UNK: I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most...
Ross : ...incredible glow.
Chandler : The moon, the glow, the magical feeling. You did this.
Chandler : Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Joey : He's right. Enough. What's the big deal about today?
Joey : So you slept with her for the first time.
Joey : You slept with her for seven years after that.
UNK: It's a little more complicated
Chandler : What is it, that she left you for another woman that likes women?
UNK: Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th floor in a coma who didn't hear you.
Chandler : Then, what?
Ross : My first time with Carol was...
Ross : ...was my....
UNK: What?
Ross : It was my first time.
Chandler : With Carol?
UNK: Oh.
Chandler : So, in your whole life, you've only been with one?
UNK: Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.
UNK: There's a bunch of stuff we could've done tonight.
Monica : Okay, I got one.
Monica : Do you remember that vegetarian pate...
Monica : ...that I made that you loved so much?
Monica : Well, unless goose is a vegetable!
Phoebe : Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Monica : -What? You slept with Jason? -You had already broken up.
Joey : -How long? -Just a couple hours.
Monica : -Oh, that's nice! -Okay, okay, okay, I got one!
UNK: Anyway, the valentine T om left in your locker was really from me!
Monica : Excuse me?
Rachel : Hello! Like he was really gonna send you one.
Rachel : She was a big girl!
Monica : Really? Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Rachel : I was laughing. You made me laugh!
UNK: Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!
UNK: -Where? -Where we've been looking all night.
UNK: -He's so cute. -George, baby, drop the towel.
UNK: -Come on, drop the towel. -Drop it. Will you please drop it?
UNK: Wow!
Joey : Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Chandler : I think it's great. You know, it's sweet.
Chandler : It's romantic.
UNK: Really?
Chandler : You kidding? The guy's a freak. I judge him.
UNK: -Hey, man! -Hey, buddy!
Receptionist : Oh, that's attractive.
Chandler : I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs.
Chandler : Admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight.
Ross : Fun? Where was the fun? T ell me which part was fun.
Ross : Where's my puck?
Joey : -The kid has it. -The kid
UNK: Excuse me, that's my puck.
Kid : I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.
Chandler : You gotta do it, man.
UNK: I' m rubber, you' re glue. Whatever you
UNK: I can't do it.
UNK: -Listen, give me back my puck. -No.
Ross : -Yes, how about? -No.

Ross : Give me my puck!
Ross : Now that was fun.
UNK: Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.
UNK: We could've played Monopoly, but no!
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.
UNK: Ross, switch with me and Phoebe could be number two.
UNK: Nothing. It's a Twister thing. The rules are on the back of the box.
UNK: Hello?
Monica : It's the Visa card people.
Rachel : -Okay. Will you take my place? -All right. This is Rachel.
