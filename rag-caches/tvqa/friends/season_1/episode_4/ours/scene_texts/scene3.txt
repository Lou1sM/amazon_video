Chandler : We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in.
Chandler : That guy with the toe thing, who's he sleeping with?
UNK: Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.
Chandler : I know we both said some things...

UNK: So, what do you think George is like?
Monica : -I think he's shy. -Yeah.

UNK: ...and he was really tender.
UNK: Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Chandler's one of those repressed guys who you'd have to seduce.
UNK: I think it's an act. Chandler is more sophisticated than he seems.
