Joey : - Instead of - That's right!
UNK: Never had that one.
Chandler : All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
UNK: What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me.
Monica : They weren't looking at you before?
Chandler : Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.
Chandler : And it turns out it's my mother.
UNK: Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: He says, "Hello," I want to kill myself.
Monica : You okay?
UNK: I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth..
Ross : - and tied it around my neck. - Cookie?
Monica : Carol moved her stuff out today.
Monica : - Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks.
Ross : No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.
Ross : - Just leave my aura alone, okay? - Fine, be murky.
UNK: - I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy. - No, you don't.
Ross : No, I don't. To hell with her. She left me!
Joey : You never knew she was a lesbian?
Ross : No! Okay?
Ross : Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
Ross : She didn't know. How should I know?
Chandler : Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Chandler : Did I say that out loud?
Ross : I told Mom and Dad last night. They took it pretty well.
UNK: Oh, really?
UNK: So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing..
UNK: "I'll never have grandchildren," was what? A wrong number?
UNK: Sorry.
Joey : Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
Joey : You're angry. You're hurting.
Joey : Can I tell you what the answer is?
UNK: Strip joints!
UNK: Hey, you're single. Have some hormones.
Phoebe : But I don't want to be single, okay?
UNK: I just want to be married again.
Chandler : And I just want a million dollars!
Monica : - Rachel? - Oh, Monica! Thank God!
UNK: I went to your building..
UNK: and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.
Waitress : - Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf.
Monica : Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.
Monica : This is everybody. Chandler and Phoebe..
UNK: Joey. Remember my brother, Ross?
UNK: Sure!
UNK: You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
UNK: Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
UNK: I was in the room with all the presents..
UNK: and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
UNK: When all of a sudden
UNK: Sweet 'N Low?
UNK: I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.
UNK: I got freaked out, and it hit me :
UNK: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
