UNK: I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.
Frannie : So, who?
Monica : You know Paul?
Ross : Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul.
Monica : You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?
UNK: What? I take credit for Paul.
Frannie : Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
Joey : Of course it was a line.
Monica : Why would anybody do something like that?
UNK: I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than :
UNK: "To get you into bed."
Monica : I hate men.
Phoebe : Don't hate. You don't want to put that out into the universe.
Monica : Is it me?
Monica : Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs..
UNK: and men with emotional problems can hear?
UNK: Come here. Give me your feet.
UNK: I just thought he was nice, you know?
Joey : I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
Rachel : - Guess what? - You got a job?
Frannie : Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.
UNK: - I was laughed out of 12 interviews. - You're surprisingly upbeat.
Rachel : You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale..
UNK: 50% off.
Chandler : How well you know me.
Rachel : They're my "I don't need a job..
UNK: I've got great boots" boots.
UNK: - How did you pay? - Credit card.
Monica : And who pays for that?
Rachel : My father.
Rachel : Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time.
Monica : You can't live off your parents.
Rachel : I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Phoebe : Give her a break. It's hard being on your own.
Phoebe : Thank you.
Phoebe : I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.
UNK: Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.
UNK: I didn't know anybody here.
Phoebe : I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.
Phoebe : And then he killed himself.
Phoebe : Then I found aromatherapy. So I know exactly how you feel.
UNK: The word you're looking for is :
UNK: "Anyway.."
Monica : - You ready? - No, how can I be ready?
UNK: "Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?"
Rachel : - I can't do this. - I know you can.
Monica : - No. - You made coffee, you can do anything.
Ross : Cut. Cut. Cut.
Ross : You know what? I think we can leave it at that.
UNK: - Kind of a symbolic gesture. - Rachel, that was a library card.
Chandler : If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Monica : Welcome to the real world!
Monica : It sucks. You're gonna love it.
Monica : That's it. Are you going to crash on the couch?
Ross : - No, I gotta go home sometime. - Are you gonna be okay?
Rachel : Look what I just found on the floor.
UNK: What?
Monica : That's Paul's watch. Just put it back where you found it.
Monica : Oh, boy! All right.
UNK: - Good night, everybody. - Good night.
