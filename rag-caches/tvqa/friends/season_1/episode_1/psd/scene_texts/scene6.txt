UNK: and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
UNK: When all of a sudden
UNK: Sweet 'N Low?
UNK: I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.
UNK: I got freaked out, and it hit me :
UNK: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
UNK: I always knew he looked familiar, but..
UNK: I had to get out of there, and I started wondering..
UNK: "Why am I doing this," and "Who am I doing it for?"
UNK: I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart..
UNK: but you're the only person I know here.
Monica : - Who wasn't invited to the wedding. - I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.
