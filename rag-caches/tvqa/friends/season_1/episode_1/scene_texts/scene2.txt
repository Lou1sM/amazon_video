Ross : It has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.
UNK: He threw some feces.
UNK: If you're working late, I can look in on him.
Ross : That would be great!
UNK: But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.
UNK: You're not doing it for me.
Chandler : Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
David : But you can't actually test this theory.
UNK: T oday's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough...
David : -...to simulate these conditions. -I have a question then.
UNK: -Yeah? -Do you plan on kissing me ever?
David : That's definitely a valid question, and the answer...
UNK: ...would be yes. Yes, I was.
UNK: But I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss...
UNK: ...at a phenomenal moment because it's you.
UNK: Sure.
David : The longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
UNK: Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where l...
David : ...sweep everything off the table.
David : And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.
UNK: David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.
Phoebe : I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.
UNK: -Really? -I'm sure.
UNK: You should just do it. Just throw me.
UNK: -Now? -Yeah, right now. Just....
David : Okay. Okay. Okay.
UNK: You know what? This is really expensive.
UNK: And this was a gift.
UNK: -Now you' re just tidying up. -Okay.
UNK: -You want me to throw you? -I can hop.
UNK: T ell me something, what does " no-date pact" mean to you?
Monica : It's just that Chandler and Phoebe have somebody.
Monica : I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Chandler : -Your ex-boyfriend? -Yeah.
Joey : -You know more than one Fun Bobby? -I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Rachel : -Okay. Here we go. -There's no room for milk.
Rachel : There. Now there is.

UNK: -Four. -Five.
