Joey : What's an elf to do?
UNK: So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops?
Rachel : We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.
UNK: I'll know. This is so not what I needed right now.
Monica : -What's the matter? -Oh, it's Marcel.
UNK: He's angry with me. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.
Ross : He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.
