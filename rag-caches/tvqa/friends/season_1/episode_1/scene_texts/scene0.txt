Phoebe : Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
UNK: That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.
Monica : Is he gonna live with you in your apartment?
UNK: Yeah. It's been kind of quiet since Carol left.
UNK: Why not get a roommate?
Ross : You reach a certain age, having a roommate is just kind of pathet
UNK: That's " pathet. " Sanskrit for " really cool way to live. "
UNK: The One With the Monkey

Joey : He's not even jolly. It's all political.
Monica : -What are you gonna be? -One of his helpers.
Joey : It's just such a slap in the face, you know?
UNK: Do you know what you' re doing for New Year's?
