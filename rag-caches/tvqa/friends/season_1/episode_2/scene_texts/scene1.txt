UNK: Guys. It's gross.
Chandler : It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem?
Chandler : -I'm right. Right? -Yeah, let her dangle.
Monica : I can't believe my parents are pushing me to find one of you people.
UNK: Come on. Just do it.
Phoebe : Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.
Chandler : Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.
Chandler : -Her machine. -Answering machine?
Chandler : No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.
Phoebe : So, why didn't you say anything?
Rachel : And I told him not to, but he got me a bottle of Chanel.
Ross : That's nice. Now was that before or after you told him...
Ross : ...to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone?
Rachel : Right. Well, we never actually got to that.
Rachel : It was just so nice to see him again.
Rachel : It was comfortable and it was familiar.
Rachel : It was just nice.
Ross : That's nice twice.
Monica : Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
UNK: Where have you been?
Rachel : It was different with him today.
Rachel : He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.
Rachel : I mean, we had fun. Is there anything wrong with that?
UNK: -Why? -I have my reasons.
Monica : He's engaged to another woman...
UNK: ...who happens to be your ex-best friend?
Joey : All right. I know it's stupid.
UNK: I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it.
Rachel : I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
