UNK: Oh, do l?
Rachel : -We ended up having sex in his chair. -You had sex in his chair?
Monica : I said that a little too loudly, didn't l?
Ross : You had what?
UNK: Mindy.
Rachel : How are you?
UNK: Yes, I heard. Congratulations. That is so great.
UNK: Really, oh, God
Rachel : I'm working tomorrow, but if you want, you can come by if you'd like.
UNK: Great.
UNK: Great.
Rachel : So I'll see you tomorrow.
UNK: Okay. Bye.
Rachel : Oh, God. Oh, God.
Chandler : So how's Mindy?
UNK: She wants to see me tomorrow. She sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.
Rachel : It's me. I just Mindy.
UNK: Mindy. No, I figured that's where you'd be.
Chandler : Hell is filled with people like you.
Joey : He's back. The peeper's back.
Joey : -Get down. -Get down?
Chandler : And boogie.
UNK: I gotta go and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Monica : She may not even know.
Rachel : I haven't heard from her in seven months, what else is it about?
Rachel : She was my best friend.
Rachel : We went to camp together, she taught me how to kiss....
UNK: Now, you know, I'm, like, the other woman.
Rachel : -I feel so -Naughty.
UNK: -See you later. -I'll walk with you.
UNK: When she taught you to kiss, were you wearing any kind of little uniform?
Joey : That's fine, yeah.
UNK: I'm going to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Monica : -Take it with you. -We haven't had a second date...
Chandler : -...she needs to hear me pee? -Why don't you call her?
UNK: I can't. I left a message. I have some pride.
Monica : -Do you? -No.
Chandler : Danielle, hi.
Chandler : It's Chandler.
Chandler : I'm fine.
UNK: Listen....
Chandler : I don't know if you tried to call me because...
Chandler : ... I accidentally shut off my phone.
UNK: That's fine. That's great. Okay.
Chandler : She's on the other line. She's gonna call me back.
Chandler : She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.
Monica : -Don't you have to pee? -That's why I'm dancing.
UNK: -Mindy. -Hey, you.
Mindy : Hey, you.
Rachel : So what's up?
Mindy : We should really be sitting for this.
Rachel : Sure we should.
UNK: I'm gonna ask once, and I want a straight answer.
UNK: Not like when I asked if those red pants made my ass look big.
UNK: I know things have been weird...
UNK: ...but you're my oldest friend, except for Laurie...
UNK: ...who's bitter because she lost weight...
Mindy : ...and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face.
UNK: -Okay, I'm just gonna say it. -Okay.
UNK: Will you be my maid of honor?
Rachel : -Of course. -That's so great.
UNK: It is. It is. It is.
UNK: -That's all you wanted to ask? -That's all.
UNK: -What? -That's not all.
Rachel : -Oh, sure it is. -Oh, no, it isn't.
UNK: I think Barry's seeing someone in the city.
Rachel : What would make you think that?
UNK: Since the engagement, he's acted weird.
Mindy : And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
UNK: Really?
Rachel : If it'll make you feel any better...
UNK: ...when Barry and I got engaged, he was weird too.
Phoebe : Oh, God. That's what I was afraid of.
Rachel : What's what you were afraid of?
Mindy : When Barry was engaged to you, he and l...
Mindy : ... kind of had a little thing on the side.
UNK: -What? -I know, I know.
UNK: When he proposed, people said, "He'll do to you what he did to Rachel."
Mindy : And now I feel so stupid.
Rachel : You are so stupid.
Rachel : We are both so stupid.
Mindy : What do you mean?
Rachel : Smell familiar?
UNK: Oh, I'm so sorry.
UNK: Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.
UNK: No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.
Monica : Oh, my.
UNK: Four letters, "circle or hoop."
UNK: -Ring, damn it, ring. -Thanks.
