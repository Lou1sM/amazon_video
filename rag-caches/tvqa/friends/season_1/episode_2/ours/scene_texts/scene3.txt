UNK: And the most enjoyable.
UNK: Phoebe, say something.
Ross : They want me to go down to this sonogram thing..
Ross : with them tomorrow.
UNK: Remember when life was simpler..
UNK: and she was just a lesbian?
UNK: Those were the days.
Rachel : - What are you gonna do? - I have no idea.
Ross : No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father.
Joey : This is still ruined, right?
UNK: Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : - What's that curry taste? - Curry.
UNK: I think they're great. I really do.
UNK: The big Lugwin had a thing for you.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : - They all had a thing for him. - Oh, Mom.
Monica : Why is this girl going to call me?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food..
UNK: I told her you have a restaurant
UNK: - I don't have, I work in a restaurant. - They don't have to know that.
UNK: - Ross, help me with the spaghetti. - Yes.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy.
UNK: We were going to have lasagna.
UNK: - I love lasagna. - We're not having it.
UNK: Then why bring it up? He latches on.
UNK: This will sound unbelievably selfish..
UNK: but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing?
UNK: It might take the heat off of me.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : That Rachel. We saw her parents at the club.
UNK: They were not playing well.
UNK: I won't say what they spent..
UNK: but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.
Monica : - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : - It's an expression. - No, it's not.
UNK: Don't listen to her. You've always been independent.
UNK: Even when you were a chubby kid..
UNK: Mr. Geller : and you had no friends, you were just fine.
UNK: Mr. Geller : You'd read alone in your room. Your puzzles..
UNK: People like Ross need to shoot for the stars.
UNK: Mr. Geller : With his museum and his published papers.
UNK: Others are satisfied with staying where they are.
UNK: These people never get cancer.
UNK: They're happy with what they have, content..
UNK: like cows.
UNK: Cows, Dad?
UNK: She knows how much I love cows.
UNK: I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God..
UNK: our "Harmonica" doesn't have that problem.
UNK: - I'm telling you, you'll be fine. - Thank you, Daddy.
UNK: Oh, so this does work.
Monica : So, Ross, what's going on with you?
UNK: Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
UNK: Look, I realize you guys have been wondering..
Ross : what exactly happened between Carol and me.
Ross : And so, well, here's the deal.
Ross : Carol's a lesbian.
UNK: She lives with a woman named Susan.
Ross : She's pregnant with my child.
Ross : She and Susan are going to raise the baby.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : And you knew about this?
Joey : Folks are really that bad?
UNK: Well, you know, these people are pros.
UNK: They know what they do.
Ross : They take their time. They get the job done.
UNK: They say that you can't change your parents.
UNK: Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.
Ross : Must pee.
UNK: It's worse when you're twins.
UNK: - You're a twin? - We don't speak.
UNK: She's this high-powered, driven, career-type.
Chandler : - What does she do? - She's a waitress.
UNK: - Identical? - People say we look alike.
UNK: But I don't see it.
UNK: You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.
UNK: Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this.
Chandler : No, although I did have an imaginary friend..
UNK: who my parents preferred.
UNK: Hit the lights, please.
Ross : How long was I in there?
Rachel : - I'm just cleaning up. - Oh, you need any help?
Rachel : Okay, sure. Thanks.
UNK: Anyway..
UNK: So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Ross : A little.
Chandler : A lot.
Rachel : So, got any advice?
UNK: You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.
Ross : You may wanna steer clear of the word "dumped."
Ross : Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man.
Ross : You should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard.
