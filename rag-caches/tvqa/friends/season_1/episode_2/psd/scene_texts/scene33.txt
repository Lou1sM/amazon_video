UNK: Hello!
Susan : - Please, what's wrong with Helen? - Helen Geller?
Ross : - I don't think so. - It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Barry : - Thank you. - No, I mean, it's not Geller.
UNK: It'll be Helen Willick?

Ross : Wait a minute. Why is she in the title?
Susan : It's my baby too.
Ross : Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.
Susan : And we all know what a challenge that is.
Carol : - You two, stop it. - She gets a credit. I'm in there too.
UNK: Helen Willick Bunch Geller? I think that borders on child abuse.
