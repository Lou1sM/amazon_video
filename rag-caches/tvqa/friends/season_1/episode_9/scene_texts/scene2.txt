UNK: I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
Chandler : In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
UNK: -Hey. -Rach, did you make your money?
Rachel : No, not even close. Forget Vail. Forget seeing my family.
Rachel : Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Monica : -Rach, here's your mail. -Thanks. You can put it on the table.
Monica : No. Here's your mail!
UNK: Thanks. You can put it on the table!
Monica : Would you just open it!
UNK: Oh, my God! You guys are great!
Monica : We all chipped in.
Joey : -We did? -You owe me $20.
Rachel : Thank you. Thank you so much!
UNK: Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast. T omato soup...
UNK: ...grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.
UNK: This is your Thanksgiving dinner? What is it with you and this holiday?
UNK: -I'm 9 years old. -I hate this story!
UNK: We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have...
Chandler : ...a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
UNK: And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
UNK: What's this? I never saw this at Mom's.
UNK: -It's a yam. -Hello....
UNK: This isn't a yam. Yam comes in purple cans.
UNK: They don't They don't come in these.
UNK: Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.
