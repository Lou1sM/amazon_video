UNK: Hi. Is Carol here?
Susan : -No, she's at a faculty meeting. -I just came by to pick up my skull.
UNK: Well, not mine, but....
Rachel : -Come in. -Thanks.
UNK: Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Susan : -What's it look like? -Kind of like a big face without skin.
Susan : Yes. I'm familiar with the concept.
