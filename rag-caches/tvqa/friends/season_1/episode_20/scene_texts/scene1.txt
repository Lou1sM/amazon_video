Chandler : Yes, it's working.
Chandler : -Why isn't she calling? -Maybe she never got your message.
Phoebe : Call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps...
UNK: ...that means she didn't get her messages yet.
UNK: -Doesn't that make me seem? -Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?
Chandler : You obviously saw my personal ad.
Phoebe : How many beeps?
Chandler : She answered.
Monica : This is where you'd use that "hello" word.
UNK: I won't talk to her. She got my message...
Chandler : ...and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed.
