UNK: It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?
UNK: It's a leave-in conditioner.
UNK: -You got a second? -Sure, sure.
Rachel : Come on...
UNK: -...in. -Hello, sweetheart.
UNK: What you guys doing here?
Rachel : We are here to break up with you.
Barry : Both of you?
UNK: We think you're a horrible person, and bad things should happen to you.
Barry : I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.
Barry : I was weak. I couldn't help myself.
Barry : Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much.
Rachel : Which one of us are you talking to there?
UNK: Mindy.
Barry : Of course, Mindy. It was always Mindy.
Rachel : When we were having sex in that chair?
Barry : I swear, whatever I was doing, I was thinking of you.
UNK: Please. That second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup.
Mindy : You did it twice?
Rachel : The first time didn't really count. You know, it was Barry.
UNK: Honey, sweetheart, look. Just give me another chance.
UNK: We'll start over. We'll go back to Aruba.
UNK: What is it with you and Aruba? Do you have a deal with the airlines?
UNK: What do you say?
Bernice : Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.
UNK: Jason Castalano 's choking on his retainer.
Phoebe : Oh, God. I'll be right there, Bernice.
UNK: Look, please don't go anywhere.
Barry : I'll be right back.
UNK: Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.
Rachel : See how he was sweating when he walked out?
Rachel : If I'm hogging the ball, you jump right in there...
UNK: ...and take some punches. This feels great.
Mindy : I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Rachel : What are you talking about?
Rachel : Mindy, the guy is the devil.
UNK: He is Satan in a smock.
Mindy : I know he's not perfect.
Mindy : But the truth is at the end of the day, I still really wanna be...
Mindy : ... Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...
UNK: ... D. D.S.
Phoebe : Oh, God.
UNK: I hope you can find a way to be happy for me.
Mindy : And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor.
Rachel : And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Monica : You okay?
UNK: Really?
Rachel : Since I ran out on Barry at the wedding...
UNK: ...I've wondered whether I made the right choice.
Rachel : And now I know.
UNK: I'm so glad.
Joey : Big day.
UNK: I'll give you this : Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
Joey : He's got the monocle, he's got the top hat....
UNK: Did you know he's gay?
UNK: I just wanna clarify this. Are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Chandler : Danielle, hi.
Chandler : Everybody, this is Danielle. Danielle, everybody.
UNK: Why are you here?
Danielle : I've been calling, but I had your number wrong.
UNK: When I got the right one, there was no answer.
UNK: So I thought I'd come down here and make sure you were okay.
Chandler : I'm okay.
Danielle : Maybe we could get together later?
Chandler : That sounds good. I'll call you. Or you call me, whatever.
Danielle : You got it.
Danielle : -Bye, everybody. -Bye.
Monica : -There you go. -Second date.
Ross : I don't know.
Rachel : You don't know?
UNK: She seems nice, but her coming all the way here...
Chandler : ...just to see if I was okay? I mean, how needy is that?
