Chandler : I can't believe you'd actually say that.
UNK: I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Joey : No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor.
UNK: He's gotta be the toughest snack there is.
Ross : I don't know. You don't wanna mess with Cornnuts.
UNK: They're crazy.
UNK: Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.
Monica : There's some creep out there with a telescope.
Ross : I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.
Rachel : Oh, that is so sick.
Chandler : I feel violated.
Chandler : And not in a good way.
Phoebe : How can people do that?
Phoebe : You guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.
Chandler : Years from now, school children will study it...
Chandler : ...as one of the greatest first dates ever.
UNK: -Yeah. -I'll say, yeah.
Chandler : It was unbelievable.
UNK: We could be ourselves. We didn't have to play games.
Monica : -Have you called her? -She'd know I like her. That's crazy.
UNK: Guys. It's gross.
Chandler : It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem?
Chandler : -I'm right. Right? -Yeah, let her dangle.
Monica : I can't believe my parents are pushing me to find one of you people.
UNK: Come on. Just do it.
Phoebe : Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.
Chandler : Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.
Chandler : -Her machine. -Answering machine?
Chandler : No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.
Phoebe : So, why didn't you say anything?
Rachel : And I told him not to, but he got me a bottle of Chanel.
Ross : That's nice. Now was that before or after you told him...
Ross : ...to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone?
Rachel : Right. Well, we never actually got to that.
Rachel : It was just so nice to see him again.
Rachel : It was comfortable and it was familiar.
Rachel : It was just nice.
Ross : That's nice twice.
Monica : Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
UNK: Where have you been?
Rachel : It was different with him today.
Rachel : He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.
Rachel : I mean, we had fun. Is there anything wrong with that?
UNK: -Why? -I have my reasons.
Monica : He's engaged to another woman...
UNK: ...who happens to be your ex-best friend?
Joey : All right. I know it's stupid.
UNK: I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it.
Rachel : I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
UNK: No, it wasn't.
UNK: It was so nice having this little sink here.
UNK: Then with authority, hang up.
UNK: Will you just leave her the message?
UNK: Okay. All right, fine.
UNK: "Oh, Danielle, I wasn't expecting the machine.
Chandler : Give me a call when you get a chance.
UNK: Bye-bye.
Phoebe : Oh, God.
Monica : That's what you've been working on for two hours?
Chandler : Hey, I've been honing.
Ross : -What was with the dishes? -She might think I'm in a restaurant.
UNK: I might have a life. Like I haven't been sitting here...
UNK: ... honing for the last two hours?
UNK: -The telescope guy's doing it again. -Oh, my God.
Phoebe : Go away. Stop looking in here.
UNK: Great. Now he's waving back.
Joey : We gotta do something.
UNK: I caught him looking into our place. I feel like I can't do stuff.
UNK: What kind of stuff?
Joey : Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff...
Joey : ...but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Phoebe : You cook naked?
Joey : Yeah, toast, oatmeal. Nothing that spatters.
Chandler : What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Barry : What's the matter?
Ross : I just Oh, Barry, this was not good.
Barry : No, it was. It was very, very good.
Rachel : -What about Mindy? -Way better than Mindy.
Rachel : I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Barry : If you want, I'll break it off with her.
UNK: No, don't do that. Not for me.
Bernice : Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Barry : Thanks, Bernice.
Barry : Let's go away this weekend.
Rachel : -This is all way too -No, we can go to Aruba.
Barry : When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon...
Barry : ...it was really nice. You would've liked it.
Rachel : I had a bra.
Bobby : Hey, Dr. Farber.
UNK: All right, Miss Greene, everything looks fine.
Barry : We're starting to see some real progress.
UNK: -What? -I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.
Chandler : Can I use your phone?
Monica : For future reference, that thing in your hand...
