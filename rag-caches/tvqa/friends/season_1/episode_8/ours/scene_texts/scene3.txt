UNK: Mrs. Geller : You're right. It's going into the ground.
UNK: We should get the most basic thing.
UNK: "The non-protective corrugated fiberboard with white laminate. "
UNK: Dad, we can't bury Nana in a dresser from kea.
UNK: This is why your mother buys my clothes.
UNK: I hate to shop. I hate it.
UNK: Isn't this more about the fact that...
UNK: ...once you decide, it's like acknowledging Nana's actually gone?
UNK: No, I really hate to shop.
UNK: -I thought it'd be a closed casket. -lt doesn't mean she can't look nice.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Ross : I don't see why not.
Ross : Here's my retainer.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I was just thinking...
UNK: Mr. Geller : -...when my time comes -Dad.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Listen to me.
UNK: Mr. Geller : When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Monica : You what?
UNK: Mr. Geller : I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun.
UNK: Define "fun. "
UNK: Come on. You'll make a day of it. You'll get a boat, pack a lunch....
Monica : And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says I'm so predictable.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, " Buried at sea? Huh? "
Monica : That's probably what they'll say.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I'd like that.
Chandler : -Hey, gorgeous. -Hey.
UNK: Look, l' m sorry about yesterday.
UNK: Don't worry. Apparently, other people have made the same mistake.
Shelley : Okay. Phew!
Chandler : So, what do you think it is about me?
UNK: I don't know what.
Shelley : You just have...
Monica : -...a quality. -A quality. Great.
UNK: It's a shame. You and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Chandler : Lowell? Financial Services Lowell? That's who you saw me with?
Shelley : What? He's cute.
Shelley : Well, yeah.
UNK: He's no Brian in Payroll.
Shelley : Is Brian?
UNK: I don't know. If you were gonna set me up...
UNK: ... I'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him.
Shelley : Brian's a little out of your league.
Chandler : Excuse me. You don't think I could get a Brian?
Chandler : Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.
Chandler : I'm really not.
Ross : This one?
UNK: I've shown you every dress we have.
UNK: Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...
Ross : ...go with the burgundy.
UNK: Whatever we pick, she'd say it's the wrong one.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Ross : A fine choice. I'm coming out.
UNK: Aunt Lillian : Wait! We need shoes.
Ross : -How about these? -That's really a day shoe.
Ross : Where she's going everyone else will be dressier?
UNK: Aunt Lillian : Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Ross : I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
Ross : I can show you something silver that may work.
UNK: Aunt Lillian : -No, it really should be burgundy. -Unless we go with a different dress.
UNK: No, no, no. Watch this.
UNK: Wait, I may have something in the back.
Rachel : Oh, my God.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Is everything all right?
UNK: Just Nana's stuff.
Ross : You guys ready?
UNK: Mom called to tell me not to wear my hair up.
UNK: -Know my ears aren't my best feature? -Some days it's all I can think about.
UNK: I' m sorry l' m late. I couldn't find my bearings.
Rachel : You mean your earrings?
UNK: What did I say?
Monica : -Are these the shoes? -Yes. Paolo sent them from ltaly.
UNK: What? We don't have shoes here?
Joey : -Morning. We ready to go? -Don't we look nice all dressed up?
Chandler : It's stuff like that, isn't it?
