Ross : I feel great. I feel great.
Monica : Wow, those pills really worked.
UNK: Yeah. Not the first two, but the second two....
Ross : I love you guys.
Ross : You guys are the greatest. I love my sister.
Ross : I love Pheebs.
Phoebe : That's so nice.
UNK: I love you, man.
Ross : And listen, if you wanna be gay, be gay!
UNK: It doesn't matter to me.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : You were right.
UNK: I do love you.
UNK: Oh, Ross. I love you too.
UNK: Oh, no, I really love you.
UNK: I really love you.
Monica : That sounds like Nana.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Do you know what it's like to grow up...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : ...with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
Monica : I can imagine.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : It's a wonder your mother turned out...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : ...to be the positive, life-affirming person she is.
Monica : That is a wonder.
Monica : So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again...
Monica : ... I mean, if she was here right now...
Monica : ...would you tell her?
UNK: T ell her what?
Monica : How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.
Monica : Like your hair, for example.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
UNK: Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Some things are better left unsaid.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : It's nicer when people just get along.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : More wine?
Monica : Oh, I think so.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Monica : Thank you.
Monica : They're yours.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Actually, they were Nana's.
UNK: Now l' m depressed!
UNK: Mr. Geller : Even more than I was.
UNK: Oh, look. My first grade picture.
UNK: Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt.
Rachel : -Hey, who's this little naked guy? -That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel : Look at the little thing!
Ross : Yes, fine. That is my penis.
Ross : Can we be grownups now?
Chandler : Who are those people?
Ross : -Got me. -That's Nana right there in the middle.
UNK: Yeah, let's see.
UNK: " Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "
Rachel : You look just like your grandmother. How old was she?
UNK: Let's see, " 1 939. "
UNK: Twenty-four, twenty-five.
UNK: It looks like a fun gang.
UNK: Look, look, look! I got Monica naked!
UNK: Let me see!
UNK: No, no. That would be me again.
Ross : I'm just trying something.
Chandler : Hey, Lowell.
UNK: Oh, hey, Chandler.
UNK: So how's it going in Financial Services?
Lowell : It's like Mardi Gras without the papier-mache heads.
UNK: How about you?
Chandler : Good. Good. Listen...
UNK: ...I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but...
UNK: ... I' m not.
Lowell : I know. That's what I told her.
UNK: Really?
Chandler : So you can tell?
Lowell : Pretty much. Most of the time. We have a kind of radar.
Chandler : So you don't think I have...
Monica : ...a quality?
Lowell : Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no.
Lowell : By the way, your friend Brian, from Payroll? He is.
Monica : -He is? -And way out of your league.
Chandler : Out of my league!
UNK: I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
Chandler : Hey, Brian.
