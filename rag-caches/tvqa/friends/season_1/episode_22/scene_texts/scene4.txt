UNK: Listen...
UNK: Young Ethan : ...as long as we're telling stuff...
UNK: Young Ethan : ... I have another one for you.
UNK: Young Ethan : I'm a little younger than I said.
Monica : -You're not a senior? -Oh, I'm a senior...
UNK: Young Ethan : ...in high school.
Monica : What we did was wrong.
UNK: I just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.
Monica : I just had sex.
Monica : Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
UNK: -You never said your age. -It's different.
Monica : My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states.
Monica : -What were you thinking? -I was too busy falling
Monica : -Don't say it. -ln love with you.
UNK: -Really? -Sorry.
UNK: Well, fall out of it.
UNK: You shouldn't be here. It's a school night.
UNK: Young Ethan : Oh, God.
Monica : I'm like those women that you see...
Monica : ...with shiny guys named Chad.
Monica : I'm Joan Collins.
UNK: Who?
UNK: Andre should be there in about 45 minutes.
UNK: Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.
UNK: Alrighty. Bye-bye.
UNK: It's just easier that way.
Chandler : -You told me about the last dream. -No. Forget it.
Chandler : Why not? Was I doing something particularly saucy?
Rachel : All right. Fine.
Rachel : You were not the only one there.
Rachel : Joey was there too.
Rachel : All right.
Rachel : Was there...
Ross : ...anybody else there?
UNK: You sure? Nobody...
UNK: ... handing out mints or anything?
Rachel : No, it was just the three of us.
UNK: So was it you and Chandler...
Joey : ...then you and me, or you, me and Chandler?
Rachel : -You know what? -What?
Rachel : There were times...
Rachel : ...when it wasn't even me.
Phoebe : That is so sweet, you guys.
Rachel : Mon, Ethan called again.
UNK: -What? -Ethan called again.
UNK: -You're not seeing him anymore? -No.
UNK: Sometimes, things don't work out.
UNK: This has nothing to do with him needing a note to get out of gym?
Rachel : I did not say anything. I swear.
Rachel : -He stopped by. -Next time you talk to him...
UNK: ...could you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Monica : Oh, my life is just so amusing. Can we drop it now?
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: "It's morphin'time."
UNK: -Stegosaurus. -Tyrannosaurus.
UNK: I gotta go.
Phoebe : Head rush.
Phoebe : One more, and then I have to go.
UNK: Cool.
UNK: Where you going?
Phoebe : A birthday party with some work people.
Chandler : Work people? Nobody told me.
Phoebe : I know. That's part of the whole...
UNK: ...them-not-liking-you extravaganza.
Chandler : A month ago, these people were my friends.
Chandler : I'm in charge, but I'm not a different person.
UNK: Then come, hang out. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Chandler : -You think I should? -I really do.
Phoebe : But could we not go together?
Phoebe : I don't wanna be the geek who invited the boss.
UNK: -Hey, you okay? -Yeah.
UNK: -This can't be easy for him either. -I know.
UNK: This may take some time for him to get over it...
UNK: ... but, then at four, Muppet Babies is on.
UNK: Go deep. Deep. Deep.
