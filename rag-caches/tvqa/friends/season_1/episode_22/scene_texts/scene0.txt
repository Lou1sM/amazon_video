Monica : -Tell him. -Tell him.
Rachel : -Shut up. -Tell me what?
UNK: You won't look at him.
Chandler : I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Rachel : All right. All right. Last night, I had a dream...
Rachel : ...that you and I were
Phoebe : Doing it on this table.
UNK: Excellent dream score.
Ross : Why would you dream that?
Chandler : More importantly...
Chandler : ...was I any good?
Rachel : Well, you were pretty damn good.
UNK: Interesting. In my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate.
Rachel : Last night, you seemed to know your way around the table.
Ross : I love it when we share.
UNK: You okay?
UNK: I can't believe you two had sex in her dream.
UNK: Sorry, it was a one-time thing.
UNK: I was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious.
UNK: The One With The lck Factor
Chandler : Hello, Rachel.
Rachel : Get off.
UNK: Ooh, give me. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Joey : I don't know. What are you wearing?
Ross : Why would you want to?
UNK: For short-term work. Till I get back my massage clients.
Chandler : Pirates again?
Phoebe : No. Nothing like that.
UNK: I'm just such a dummy.
UNK: I taught a "Massage Yourself at Home" workshop. And they are.
Joey : Hey, Chan, she could work for you.
Chandler : Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.
Phoebe : I could. I could do it. What is it?
UNK: My secretary's gonna be out. She's having one of her boobs reduced.
Chandler : It's a whole big boob story.
Phoebe : -I could be a secretary. -I don't know if it'd be your thing...
UNK: ... because it involves being normal for a large portion of the day.
Phoebe : I could do that.
UNK: -What's that? -My new beeper.
UNK: Why does a paleontologist need a beeper?
UNK: Is it for dinosaur emergencies? Help. They're still extinct.
Ross : It's for when Carol goes into labor.
UNK: All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.
UNK: A cool number and a possible name for the kid.
UNK: -See you later. -Off to see young Ethan?
Monica : Thank you.
Joey : How young is young Ethan? Young?
Monica : He's our age.
Chandler : When we were....
Monica : -He's a senior in college. -College?
UNK: Rob that cradle.
UNK: He's smart and mature and grown-up.
UNK: Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.
Chandler : This man-child has no problem with how old you are?
Monica : No, of course not. It's not even an issue...
UNK: ... because I said I was 22.
UNK: -You what? -What?
Monica : -Oh, I can't pass for 22? -Well, maybe 25, 26.
Monica : -I am 26. -There you go.
Chandler : Can you hear that?
Chandler : That'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe : -Oh, I'm on. -Okay.
Phoebe : Mr. Bing's office.
Phoebe : -Sorry, he's in a meeting. -I'm not in a meeting.
Phoebe : Will he know what this is in reference to?
Phoebe : And he has your number?
Phoebe : I'll see that he gets the message. Bye-bye.
Phoebe : Ross says hi.
Phoebe : This is so fun. What do we do now?
Chandler : Well, now I actually have to get to work.
UNK: "Most likely."
Phoebe : Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
UNK: All right. Bye-bye.
UNK: Bye-bye.
UNK: -Yes? -What you doing?
UNK: Okay, windows are clean. Candles are lit.
UNK: BeIt's too tight. Gotta change.
Monica : Did I turn the fish? Nope, because I made lasagna.
Monica : -Am I out of control? -Just a touch.
Rachel : I don't understand. You've been dating this guy since...
Rachel : ... his midterms.
UNK: Why, all of a sudden, are you so...?
UNK: -What? -Could tonight be the night?
UNK: I don't know. He's a great guy...
Monica : ...and I love being with him. But, you know...
