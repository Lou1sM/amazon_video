Joey : Ross, she wants you.
Ross : We just live in the same building.
Chandler : -Any contact? -She lent me an egg.
Joey : -You're in! -Right.
UNK: Hey, Ross.
UNK: Come on. Get back in the game.
UNK: The Rachel thing isn't happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian....
Chandler : I don't think we need a third.
Joey : Could we get an egg, still in the shell?
Ross : An egg?
Joey : Go up to her and say, "I'm returning your egg."
Chandler : I think it's winning.
Ross : -It's insane. -She'll love it.
