UNK: No.
UNK: I have this friend who shaves her head.
UNK: She says to break the bad boyfriend cycle...
UNK: ...you can do a cleansing ritual.
UNK: Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.
UNK: Yeah.
Phoebe : We can do it tomorrow night.
Phoebe : It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
UNK: Okay, what kind of ritual?
Phoebe : We can burn the stuff they gave us.
UNK: Or...?
Phoebe : Or we can chant and dance around naked with sticks.
Monica : Burning's good.
Phoebe : You know...
UNK: ... I can pick up quarters with my toes.
UNK: Yeah? Good for you.
Joey : Quarters or rolls of quarters?
UNK: By the way, I cut you out of all of my pictures.
Janice : So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
UNK: That's okay.
Janice : You could make little puppets out of them.
Janice : And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty!
Joey : -We can't do that! -What? What can't you do?
Joey : Can I talk to you for a second? Over there?
Joey : We might be leaving now.
UNK: Tell me it's you and me "we."
Joey : She wants to slather my body with stuff and lick it off.
Joey : I'm not even sure what slathering is!
Joey : But I definitely want to be a part of it!
UNK: Okay, you cannot do this to me.
Joey : You're right. I'm sorry.
Lorraine : Can we have three chocolate mousses to go?
UNK: I'm out of here.
Joey : Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me.
Chandler : I hope she throws up on you.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: -So.... -Just us.
Chandler : What a crappy night!
Janice : I have enjoyed the fact...
Janice : ...that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper.
Joey : Excuse me.
UNK: How you doing?
Janice : So do we have the best friends, or what?
Chandler : Joey's not a friend. He's...
Chandler : ...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
UNK: Another drink? Dessert? A big-screen TV?
UNK: -I'll have a drink. -Got it. Good woman!
UNK: -A bottle of overpriced champagne. -Each.
Chandler : That's right, each. And a rob roy.
Chandler : I've always wanted to know.
Janice : Happy Valentine's Day!
Janice : Oh, I miss you already.
Janice : -Can you believe this happened? -No, no!
Chandler : And yet it did.
Chandler : -Goodbye, Janice. -kiss me!
Monica : Oh, Chandler. Sorry.
Monica : Oh, Chandler. Sorry!
Monica : -Hey, Janice. -Hi, Monica.
Chandler : Well, this was very special.
Monica : Rach, come see who's out here!
UNK: What's going on? Oh, my God!
Rachel : Janice! Hi!
Chandler : Janice is gonna go away now!
Monica : I'll be right back.
Rachel : Joey! Look who it is!
Chandler : Good. Joey's home.
UNK: This is so much fun!
Janice : This is like a reunion in the hall!
UNK: Ross, there's someone I want you to say hi to.
UNK: He happened to call.
UNK: Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me! How did you know?
UNK: So, if dogs experience jet lag...
UNK: ... because of the seven dog years to one human year thing...
