Joey : Ross, she wants you.
Ross : We just live in the same building.
Chandler : -Any contact? -She lent me an egg.
Joey : -You're in! -Right.
UNK: Hey, Ross.
UNK: Come on. Get back in the game.
UNK: The Rachel thing isn't happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian....
Chandler : I don't think we need a third.
Joey : Could we get an egg, still in the shell?
Ross : An egg?
Joey : Go up to her and say, "I'm returning your egg."
Chandler : I think it's winning.
Ross : -It's insane. -She'll love it.
UNK: -Thank you. -Thank you. Here.
Chandler : Go with the egg, my friend.
UNK: Go, go, go!
Joey : -Think it'll work? -No way. It's suicide.
UNK: -You can't do this. -Do what?
Monica : -Roger wants to take her out. -No! Remember why you dumped him?
UNK: Because he was creepy.
UNK: And mean. And frightening.
Phoebe : Still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
UNK: You can go out with a creep any night.
Monica : I know I do.
UNK: -What are you doing tomorrow night? -That depends on how tonight goes.
Chandler : -About tonight -Don't you bail on me!
UNK: I said I'd bring a friend for her friend.
UNK: -But her friend sounds like a -Pathetic mess. I know, but....
UNK: Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.
UNK: I'm thinking....
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: You haven't been out with a woman since Janice. You're doing this.
Ross : -She said yes. -Way to go, man!
Chandler : Still got the egg, huh?
Joey : How do I look?
Chandler : I don't care.
UNK: There's Lorraine.
Chandler : No trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine : Hi, Joey.
Lorraine : Well, well! Look what you brought!
Lorraine : Very nice.
Chandler : And what did you bring?
UNK: She's checking her coat.
UNK: I'm gonna wash the cab smell off of my hands.
Lorraine : Get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
UNK: Janice?
UNK: Janice!?
UNK: Oh...
Chandler : ... my...
UNK: ...God!
Chandler : Hey, it's Janice!
UNK: Okay, I'm making a break for it!
UNK: I've been waiting for, like, forever to go out with Lorraine.
Joey : -Just calm down. -Calm down?
UNK: You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months!
UNK: Can you stop yelling? You're making me nervous and....
Joey : I can't go when I'm nervous.
Chandler : I'm sorry, you're right.
Chandler : Come on! Do it, do it!
Rachel : Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete.
UNK: -Who? -Pete the Weeper.
UNK: The guy that used to cry every time we had sex?
Rachel : "Was it good for you?"
UNK: I'd take crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy!
Monica : "I win! I win!"
UNK: We went out for two months. I didn't win once.
UNK: How do we end up with these jerks?
UNK: We're some kind of magnets.
Phoebe : I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Monica : There's more beer, right?
UNK: You know my friend who shaves her head?
