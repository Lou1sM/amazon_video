UNK: Sorry it didn't work out.
Chandler : What, not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
Chandler : Didn't you listen to the story?
UNK: Didn't you listen? It's twisted!
Monica : How could you get involved with her?
UNK: I had trouble with it at first. But I get the good stuff.
UNK: All the fun, all the talking, all the sex...
UNK: ...and none of the responsibility.
UNK: -This is every guy's fantasy! -That's not true!
Phoebe : -Ross, is this your fantasy? -No, of course not.
Ross : Yeah. Yeah, it is.
UNK: You'd go out with someone going out with someone else?
Joey : -I couldn't. -Good for you.
UNK: When l' m with a woman, I need to know...
UNK: ... I' m going out with more people than her.
UNK: Once, I went out with a guy who just got divorced.
UNK: It was hard. His kids liked me better than him.
UNK: What does this have to do with Chandler?
