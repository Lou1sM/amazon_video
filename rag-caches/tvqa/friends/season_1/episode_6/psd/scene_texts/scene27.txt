Chandler : But there's this other guy.
UNK: The guy who wells up when the Grinch's heart grows...
Chandler : ...and breaks that measuring device.
UNK: He's saying, you know, "This is too hard. Get out! "
UNK: So, which one of the guys will you listen to?
Chandler : I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish.
Aurora : Which one?
Chandler : The second guy.
Monica : I see.
Aurora : Call me if you change your mind.
Chandler : Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
UNK: Look at it this way. You dumped her!
