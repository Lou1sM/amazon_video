UNK: Joey...
UNK: ...sweetheart, let me ask you a question.
UNK: Did you ever see the movie Sleepless in Seattle?
UNK: -Wow! Do you represent those actors? -No.
UNK: But you know the end, where they' re happy?
UNK: That's gonna be you and me.
UNK: You mean you wanna sign me?
UNK: No, I wanna go to the top of the Empire State Building and make out.
UNK: Of course I wanna sign you!
UNK: -Miss Leonard, I'm so -Oh, boy.
UNK: -Ride them, cowboy. -l' m sorry!
UNK: I don't see it!
UNK: -T ry to look through it. -Unfocus your eyes.
UNK: Focus? There's nothing to focus on.
UNK: -It's the Statue of Liberty! -Right!
UNK: -Where's the Statue of Liberty? -There.
UNK: I can't not see it now.
Chandler : Hey, kids!
UNK: Come here. Do you see anything here?
UNK: -lt looks like a boat. -A boat.
UNK: Right in front of the Statue of Liberty.
UNK: It's been seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.
UNK: How was your date, Chandler?
Chandler : It was unbelievable!
Chandler : I've never met anyone like her. She's had an amazing life!
Chandler : She was in the Israeli army.
Aurora : None of the bullets hit the engine, so we made it to the border.
UNK: But just barely, and l....
Aurora : I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry.
UNK: What about you? T ell me a story.
UNK: All right, once...
Chandler : ... I got on the subway.
Chandler : And it was at night...
Chandler : ...and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn.
Chandler : Just for the hell of it.
UNK: We talked until 2 : 00. It was perfect.
UNK: More or less.
UNK: Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.
UNK: I' m sorry, so "we" is...?
UNK: "We" is me and Rick.
Chandler : Who's Rick?
Chandler : Who's Rick?
Aurora : My husband.
Chandler : -Oh, so you' re divorced? -No.
UNK: I' m sorry. So you' re widowed? Hopefully?
UNK: No, l' m still married.
UNK: So, how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me...
UNK: ...sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Aurora : Don't worry.
Aurora : He'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan.
UNK: Ethan? There's an Ethan?
Aurora : Ethan is my boyfriend.
UNK: What?
UNK: What kind of relationship do you imagine us having...
UNK: ...if you have a husband and a boyfriend?
Aurora : I suppose, mainly sexual.
UNK: Sorry it didn't work out.
Chandler : What, not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
Chandler : Didn't you listen to the story?
UNK: Didn't you listen? It's twisted!
Monica : How could you get involved with her?
UNK: I had trouble with it at first. But I get the good stuff.
UNK: All the fun, all the talking, all the sex...
UNK: ...and none of the responsibility.
UNK: -This is every guy's fantasy! -That's not true!
Phoebe : -Ross, is this your fantasy? -No, of course not.
Ross : Yeah. Yeah, it is.
UNK: You'd go out with someone going out with someone else?
Joey : -I couldn't. -Good for you.
UNK: When l' m with a woman, I need to know...
UNK: ... I' m going out with more people than her.
UNK: Once, I went out with a guy who just got divorced.
UNK: It was hard. His kids liked me better than him.
UNK: What does this have to do with Chandler?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: I didn't have anything on that topic.
UNK: So I went another way.
UNK: You know, monogamy can be a tricky concept.
Ross : I mean, anthropologically speaking
UNK: Fine. Now you'll never know.
UNK: We' re kidding. T ell us.
UNK: -We wanna know. -Come on!
UNK: All right. There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey
Chandler : Are we greeting each other this way now? I like it.
Rachel : Look! I cleaned!
Rachel : I did the windows. I did the floors.
UNK: I used all the vacuum attachments but the round one. What's it for?
Ross : Nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
UNK: What do you think?
UNK: -It's very clean. -Really, it looks great!
Monica : I see you moved the green ottoman.
Monica : How did that happen?
UNK: I don't know. It looked better there.
UNK: And it's an extra seat around the table.
Monica : Yeah, it's interesting.
UNK: But you know what? Just for fun...
UNK: ...Iet's see what it looked like in the old spot.
Monica : Just to compare.
Monica : Let's see.
Monica : Well, it looks good there too.
UNK: Let's leave it there for a while.
UNK: I can't believe you moved the green ottoman.
UNK: Be glad you didn't fan the magazines. She'll scratch your eyes out.
Monica : -You guys, I am not that bad! -Yeah, you are.
