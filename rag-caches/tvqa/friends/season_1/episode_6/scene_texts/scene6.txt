UNK: Okay, and the robe is lost.
UNK: I would like to get this in one take.
Director : Let's roll it.
Director : Water's working.
Director : And action!
Director : And cut!
UNK: Butt guy, what are you doing?
Joey : I'm showering.
Director : No, that was clenching.
Joey : The way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know?
Joey : His wife's dead, his brother's missing.
Joey : I think his butt would be angry here.
Director : I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.
Director : Once again, rolling. Water working.
Director : And action!
Director : And cut! What was that?
Joey : I was going for quiet desperation.
Joey : But if you have to ask....
Chandler : God, I love these fingers.
Chandler : Thank you.
Chandler : No, actually, I meant my fingers.
UNK: Look at them. Look at how happy they are.
UNK: -Oh, my God, l' m late! -Oh, no!
Chandler : -Don't go. -Okay.
Aurora : -I have to. -Look, she's leaving.
UNK: I' m sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Chandler : -I thought you talked to Rick. -It's not Rick.
UNK: Ethan? He gets the whole day!
UNK: No, it's Andrew.
UNK: I know there'll be moments...
Chandler : ...when I'll regret asking the following question, but....
Chandler : -And Andrew is? -He's...
Joey : ... new.
UNK: So you' re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
Aurora : No, that's not exactly what I was
Chandler : Most women would kill...
Chandler : ...for three guys like us.
Aurora : -So, what do you want? -You.
Aurora : -You have me. -No. Just you.
UNK: -What do you mean? -Lose the other guys.
Aurora : Like, all of them?
UNK: Come on, we' re great together. Why not?
UNK: Can't we have what we have now?
UNK: Why can't we talk and make love...
Aurora : ...without feeling obligated to each other?
Aurora : Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.
UNK: Well, part of me wants that...
UNK: ... but it's like l' m two guys. One guy's saying, "This is great! "
Chandler : But there's this other guy.
UNK: The guy who wells up when the Grinch's heart grows...
Chandler : ...and breaks that measuring device.
UNK: He's saying, you know, "This is too hard. Get out! "
UNK: So, which one of the guys will you listen to?
Chandler : I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish.
Aurora : Which one?
Chandler : The second guy.
Monica : I see.
Aurora : Call me if you change your mind.
Chandler : Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
UNK: Look at it this way. You dumped her!
UNK: Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy...
UNK: ...and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable.
UNK: T ell me why you did this again?
UNK: Movie star!
UNK: Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Pacino movie?
UNK: Nope.
Ross : No? What happened, big guy?
Ross : Big guy?
UNK: It felt like a "big guy" moment.
Joey : I got fired!
Joey : They said I acted too much with it.
Joey : I told everybody about this!
UNK: -Everybody's expecting to see me. -lKnow what?
UNK: -No one will be able to tell. -My mom will.
UNK: There's something so sweet and disturbing about that.
UNK: I've done crappy plays for six years...
Joey : ...and I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
UNK: Maybe this wasn't it.
Ross : I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.
Ross : Did it feel like your shot?
Joey : Hard to tell. I was naked.
UNK: I don't think this was it. I don't think you just get one.
UNK: I believe things are gonna happen for you. I do.
UNK: You've got to think about the day some kid will go :
UNK: "l got the part! I'm gonna be Joey T ribbiani's ass! "
UNK: You think? That's so nice.
UNK: I' m sorry, Joey. I' m gonna go to bed, guys.
UNK: -Good night. -Good night.
UNK: You' re gonna leave your shoes out here?
Rachel : Really? Just casually strewn about...
Rachel : ...in that reckless, haphazard manner?
UNK: It doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!
UNK: Whenever.
Ross : She is a kook.
Monica : If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.
UNK: No, don 't do this!
Monica : This is stupid!
UNK: I don 't have to prove anything. I'm gonna get them.
Monica : But then everyone will know.
UNK: Unless I get them, then wake up really early and put them back.
Monica : I need help!
UNK: -All you want is a dinkle -Not that song!
UNK: -All you envy's a schwang -Come on, you guys.
UNK: A thing through which you can tinkle
UNK: Or play with or simply let hang
UNK: All you want is a dinkle
UNK: What you envy's a schwang
UNK: A thing through which you can tinkle
UNK: Or play with or simply let hang
