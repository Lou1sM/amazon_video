UNK: Remember, I lived with you? You were a little....
Monica : That is so unfair!
Ross : When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.
Monica : Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized.
Monica : But hey, I can be a kook!
UNK: All right, you madcap gal!
Ross : Imagine this.
Ross : The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Monica : -Why not? -Because you're a kook!
UNK: You wait until they send a notice.
Monica : I could do that.
UNK: Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping
UNK: -No problem. -I'm not done yet.
UNK: And I buy detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Monica : Why would someone do that?
Monica : One might wonder.
UNK: But I would be fine with that.
UNK: A glass is on the table with no coaster. A cold drink. A hot day.
Chandler : Beads of condensation are inching closer to the wood....
Monica : Stop it!
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: It's true. Who am l?
Ross : Monica, you' re Mom.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Joey : Okay, I'll be there.
Joey : That was my agent.
Joey : My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie!
UNK: -That's great! -What's the part?
UNK: Can you believe it? Pacino! This guy's why I became an actor!
UNK: " Out of order? You' re out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order! "
UNK: Seriously, what's the part?
Joey : "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! "
UNK: Come on. Seriously, Joey, what's the part?
UNK: You' re.... What?
UNK: I' m his butt double, okay?
Joey : I play Al Pacino's butt.
UNK: All right? He goes into the shower, and then...
UNK: ... I' m his butt.
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: Come on, you guys.
UNK: It's a real Pacino movie and that's big!
UNK: It's terrific. You deserve this.
UNK: After years of struggling you've cracked your way into show business.
Joey : Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.
Joey : -This is a big break for me! -You' re right. It is.
UNK: So, will you invite us to the big opening?
UNK: -I need some moisturizer. -For what?
UNK: T oday's the big day!
UNK: You got any tweezers? I think I have a rogue hair.
UNK: God. Go in the bathroom. Use whatever you want.
Monica : Don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Chandler : Thank you.
UNK: -Joey's mom's on the phone. -ln the bathroom.
UNK: -You don't wanna go in there! -Come on, we' re roommates.
Chandler : My eyes! My eyes!
Monica : I warned you.
Rachel : Who is being loud?
Chandler : Oh, that would be Monica.
UNK: Can I borrow stuff? I wanna make Aurora breakfast.
Monica : You got the whole night?
UNK: Well, I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so....
UNK: Do I sense resentment?
Chandler : No. No resentment. Believe me...
UNK: ...it's worth it, okay?
UNK: In a relationship, you have moments you'll remember the rest of your life.
Chandler : Every single second is like that with Aurora.
UNK: I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you.
Chandler : So, Monica, can you help me with the door?
UNK: The old Monica would remind you...
UNK: ...to scrub that T eflon pan with a plastic brush.
UNK: But l' m not gonna do that.
UNK: Excuse me? Can they warm it up? I' m concerned about goose bumps.
Director : Everybody ready?
UNK: I wanna thank you for this opportunity.
UNK: I mean, I know this is just a first step, but I hope that someday
Director : Lose the robe.
Joey : Right. Okay. Losing the robe!
