Joey : You don't say.
Ross : So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight?
Rachel : Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama.
UNK: You wanna hear a freakish coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
UNK: -Who? -Me!
Ross : Was that not clear?
Ross : Why don't...?
Ross : Why don't I just join you both there?
