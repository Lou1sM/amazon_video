UNK: Let it go. It's not a big deal.
UNK: Not a big deal? It's amazing. You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!
Ross : A bra. Right out the sleeve.
UNK: As far as I know, guys don't do anything that comes close. Right?
Rachel : Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
UNK: We can? Okay, I'm trying that.
Joey : Know what blows my mind?
Joey : Women can see breasts anytime they want.
UNK: You look down, and there they are.
Joey : How you get any work done is beyond me.
UNK: I don't get how guys can do so many mean things...
UNK: ...and not even care.
Ross : -Multiple orgasms! -There you go.
Chandler : Saturday night. The big night!
Chandler : Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night!
Joey : -No plans, huh? -Not a one!
UNK: Not even breaking up with Janice?
Chandler : Right, right. Shut up.
Monica : Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.
UNK: Except for Kevin Millmore, may he rot in hell.
Monica : -You just gotta do it. -I know. But it's just so hard.
Chandler : You're sitting there with her. She has no idea.
Chandler : You finally get up the courage to do it.
UNK: There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
UNK: You try to run out of the restaurant before she's finished the note.
Joey : Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man. Just stop calling.
Phoebe : If you want, I'll do it with you.
Chandler : She'd feel like we're ganging up on her.
UNK: You dump Janice, I'll dump T ony.
UNK: -You're breaking up with T ony? -He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.
Phoebe : I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike, I don't know.
UNK: Do you want anything else?
UNK: You had a nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y, pie thing that
UNK: Nothing. I' m fine.
UNK: What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?
UNK: My father wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Ross : That guy, he burns me up.
UNK: Yeah, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.
Rachel : It was horrible! He called me "young lady. "
Chandler : I hate when my father calls me that.
UNK: Did he say "You' re not up to this" again?
UNK: I got the extended version with choruses of...
UNK: ... "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "
Angela : Hi, Joey.
UNK: Oh, my God! Angela!
Monica : Wow! Being dumped by you agrees with her.
Phoebe : -Are you gonna go over there? -No. Yeah. No.
UNK: Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager.
Joey : One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
Joey : ...three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.
Joey : -Hey, Angela. -Joey.
Joey : You look good.
UNK: That's because l' m wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Joey : You don't say.
Ross : So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight?
Rachel : Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama.
UNK: You wanna hear a freakish coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
UNK: -Who? -Me!
Ross : Was that not clear?
Ross : Why don't...?
Ross : Why don't I just join you both there?
Rachel : Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
UNK: Yes.
Ross : I do have a laundry room in my building.
Ross : But there's a rat problem.
Ross : Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets.
UNK: They're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy.
UNK: -Anyway, 7-ish? -Sure.
UNK: -Forget it. I' m with Bob now. -Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Angela : Bob is great. He's smart, sophisticated, and he has a real job.
Angela : You go on three auditions a month and you' re an actor. Bob
Joey : Come on! We were great together.
Joey : And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.
UNK: Sorry, Joey. You said, " Let's be friends. " So guess what?
UNK: -What? -We' re just friends.
Joey : Fine. Fine.
UNK: Why don't the four of us have dinner tonight? As friends.
UNK: What "four of us"?
Joey : You and Bob, and me and my girlfriend...
Rachel : ... Monica.
UNK: I' m telling you, this guy's perfect for you.
Monica : Forget it! Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Joey : Come on, this guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's...
Joey : ... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated...
Angela : ...and he has a real job.
Joey : I go on three auditions a month and say l' m an actor, but he's
Monica : -God help us. -What?
Monica : Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.
UNK: Look, l' m asking a favor here.
Joey : If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
