Monica : So anyway...
UNK: ...his head is flopping down Broadway, right?
UNK: And I'm thinking how inappropriate this is.
UNK: Something's in my eye. Could we check it in the light, please?
Monica : -Oh, my God! -What?
Monica : Were we at the same table? It's like...
Monica : ...cocktails in Appalachia.
Joey : -They' re close. -Close? Her tongue's in his ear.
Joey : Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross.
Monica : Joey, this is sick. It's disgusting. It's...
Monica : ... not really true' is it?
Joey : Who's to say what's true?
Monica : -What were you thinking? -l' m not proud of this, okay?
Joey : Well, maybe I am a little.
UNK: -l' m out of here! -Wait!
UNK: You like him. I want her. He likes you.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah.
Joey : If we put our heads together, between the two of us...
Joey : ...we can break them up.
UNK: I' m sorry. I can't believe I did this.
Monica : I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Joey : Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here.
Chandler : Here's the thing. We're different.
UNK: I'm bing, bing, bing. You' re boom, boom, boom.
UNK: Oh, my God! I' m so sorry!
UNK: Are you okay?
UNK: It's just my lens. It's my lens.
Janice : I'll be right back.
Chandler : I hit her in the eye! In the eye!
Chandler : This is the worst breakup in the history of the world!
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: -How many have you had? -I don't know. A million!
Phoebe : Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place.
UNK: -l' m fine, l' m fine. -All right.
UNK: -l' m not fine. Here she is. -Wait here, okay? Breathe.
Chandler : -How do you do that? -It's like a gift.
UNK: We should always break up together.
Phoebe : I'd like that!
UNK: The clothes are clean. That's the important part.
Rachel : I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Woman : I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Woman : I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things.
Woman : Now, come on. Get out of my way.
UNK: I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart.
UNK: There weren't clothes in it!
Rachel : Hey, hey, hey, hey! Quit making up rules!
UNK: Let go! Come on, it's my cart.
UNK: Listen, Mitzi, if you want it...
Rachel : ...you' re gonna have to take me with it!
Rachel : -Yes! Did you see that? -You were incredible.
UNK: A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
UNK: Thank you. I could not have done this without you.
Ross : More clothes in the dryer?
Ross : -I'm fine. I'm fine. -Are you sure?
UNK: -Are you sure you' re okay? -Yeah.
Rachel : -Does it still hurt? -Yeah.
Phoebe : What a neat idea! All your clothes match. I' m gonna do this.
Phoebe : -How'd it go? -Excellent!
Monica : We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Ross : What a beautiful story.
Ross : -I'm fine, by the way. -I'm sorry.
Rachel : -Where's Chandler? -He needed time to grieve.
UNK: I' m free! I' m free!
UNK: That ought to do it.
