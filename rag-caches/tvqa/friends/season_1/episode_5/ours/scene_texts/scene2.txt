Woman : Hey, hey, hey! Her stuff wasn't in it!
Ross : Hey, hey, hey! That's not the rule, and you know it!
Ross : All right. Show's over.
Ross : Nothing to see here.
UNK: Okay. Let's do laundry.
Rachel : That was amazing! I can't even send back soup.
Ross : Well, that's because you' re such a sweet, gentle....
Ross : Do you? Do you? Oh, hey. You must need detergent.
Rachel : -What's that? -Uberweiss.
Ross : It's new. It's German. It's extra tough!
UNK: Rach, are you gonna separate those?
Monica : Oh, God. Am I being a total laundry spaz?
UNK: Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?
Ross : Have you never done this before?
Rachel : Well, not myself. But I know other people that have.
UNK: Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Ross : Don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle.
Ross : Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.
UNK: A whole other machine for your colors.
Ross : And a third for your...
UNK: ...delicates. That would be your bras...
Ross : ...and your underpanty things.
Rachel : These are white cotton panties.
Rachel : Would they go with whites or with delicates?
Ross : That would be a judgment call.
