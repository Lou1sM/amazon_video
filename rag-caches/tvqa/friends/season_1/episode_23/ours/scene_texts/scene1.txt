Phoebe : -Thanks, Ross. -I'm paying you to stop.
Phoebe : Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute.
Monica : No fair.
Monica : I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Chandler : -You'll get one. -When?
Chandler : Tell you what. When we're 40, if neither of us are married...
UNK: ...what do you say we have one?
Monica : Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler : I just meant hypothetically.
Monica : Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica : What is it? Is there something unmarriable about me?
UNK: Well?
Chandler : Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack.
Phoebe : Look at you, dressy-dress.
Monica : Did you go home and change?
Rachel : It's an important day. I want to look nice.
Rachel : Has Dr. Franzblau been by?
Monica : I haven't seen him.
Rachel : Where is he? He is supposed to be here.
Rachel : What if the baby needs him?
UNK: What's the deal with you and doctors? Is your father a doctor?
Rachel : Yeah. Why?
Chandler : No reason.
Lydia : Mom, we've been through this.
UNK: No, I am not calling him.
Lydia : I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk.
UNK: No, I am not alone. Joey's here.
UNK: What do you mean "Joey who"?
Lydia : Joey who?
UNK: -Tribbiani. -Joey Tribbiani.
