Guy : So is this her?
Lydia : No, this is a loaner.
UNK: Ours is at the shop.
UNK: God, I hope she has my brains.
Guy : I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.

Phoebe : I barely had enough pieces to make one whole parent.
UNK: And here's this baby who has three whole parents...
UNK: ...who fight over who gets to love it the most...
Phoebe : ...and it's not even born yet.
Phoebe : It's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.
Phoebe : I'm sorry. You were fighting.
