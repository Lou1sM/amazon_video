UNK: - Don't you respect your body? - Don't you see what you're doing?
UNK: I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease.
Chandler : The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
UNK: Alan wants to speak to you.
Chandler : Really? He does?
Chandler : Hey, buddy! What's up?
Chandler : She told you about that, huh?
Chandler : Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.
Chandler : It's not that
Chandler : Well, that's true.
UNK: Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.
Chandler : Well, okay. Thanks.
Rachel : God, he's good.
Ross : - If only he were a woman. - Yeah.
UNK: Lamb Chop!
Chandler : How old is that sock?
Chandler : If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.
Ross : I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Monica : - Where's Joey? - Joey ate my last stick of gum..
Chandler : so I killed him.
Chandler : Do you think that was wrong?
Rachel : - I think he's across the hall. - Thanks.
UNK: There you go.
Chandler : I'm alive with pleasure now.
UNK: Phoebe, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart?
Phoebe : Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Ross : Hey, I might.
Ross : I'm sorry.
UNK: The soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb.
Phoebe : And on my way over here I stepped in gum.
Phoebe : What is up with the universe?
Joey : - What's going on? - It's just nice when we're together.
UNK: It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear.
Monica : Please, guys, we have to talk.
Phoebe : Wait! I'm getting a deja vu.
Phoebe : No, I'm not.
Monica : - We have to talk. - There it is!
UNK: Okay, it's about Alan.
UNK: Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair.
UNK: Before you get into that, there's something you should know.
Monica : There's really no easy way to say this.
Monica : I've decided to break up with Alan.
Ross : Is there somebody else?
Monica : No, it's just..
UNK: you know, things change. People change.
Rachel : We didn't change.
Joey : So that's it? It's over?
Joey : Just like that?
Phoebe : You let your guard down. You start to care about someone, and..
UNK: - I can go on pretending - Okay!
UNK: No.
UNK: That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you.
UNK: Well, who wants fair?
UNK: I just want things back, you know, the way they were.
Ross : - I'm sorry. - Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.
UNK: I can't believe this!
Rachel : With the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family.
UNK: I'll meet someone. There'll be other Alans.
All : Yeah, right!
Monica : - Are you guys gonna be okay? - We'll be fine.
Ross : We're just gonna need a little time.
Monica : I understand.
Alan : - Wow. - I'm really sorry.
UNK: Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.
UNK: - But I'm a little relieved. - Relieved?
UNK: Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you.
Alan : I just can't stand your friends.
Rachel : Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?
Rachel : That was fun.
Ross : He could row like a Viking.
Ross : So how'd it go?
Phoebe : You know.
Phoebe : Did he mention us?
UNK: He says he's really gonna miss you guys.
Ross : - Rough day, huh? - You have no idea.
UNK: Come here.
Chandler : - That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. - No!
UNK: I don't care! I'm weak!
Chandler : I've gotta have the smoke!
Phoebe : If you never smoke again, I'll give you $7000.
UNK: Yeah, all right.
