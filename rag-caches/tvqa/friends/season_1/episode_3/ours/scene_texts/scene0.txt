Phoebe : - Hi, guys. - Hey, Phoebe.
UNK: - How did it go? - Not so good.
UNK: He walked me home and said, "Let's do this again."
UNK: He said, "Let's do this again." That's good, right?
UNK: Translated, "Let's do this again" means, "You'll never see me naked."
Rachel : Since when?
Joey : Since always. It's, like, dating language.
UNK: Like, "It's not you" means, "It is you."
UNK: "You're nice" means, "I'll be dating alcoholics..
Chandler : and complaining about them to you."
UNK: "We should see other people" means :
UNK: "Ha-ha, I already am!"
Rachel : Everybody knows this?
Joey : Cushions the blow.
UNK: Like your parents putting the dog to sleep..
UNK: and saying it went to a farm.
UNK: That's funny. Because our parents actually did..
Ross : send our dog off to live on a farm.
UNK: Ross?
UNK: Hello! The Milner's farm in Connecticut?
UNK: The Milners had this unbelievable farm.
Ross : They had horses and rabbits to chase.
Ross : And it was..
UNK: Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!
UNK: The One With the Thumb
Chandler : How does it feel knowing you're about to die?
Joey : Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.
UNK: But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.
Chandler : That was really good!
Joey : Thanks. Let's keep going.
UNK: So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?
Joey : I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke.
Chandler : Smoke away!
UNK: I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.
Rachel : - What? - Relax your hand.
UNK: Let your wrist go.
Chandler : Not so much!
UNK: All right. Now take a puff.
UNK: Right.
Chandler : - Give it to me. - I'm not giving you a cigarette.
UNK: It's fine. Do you want to get this part or not? Here.
UNK: Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.
Chandler : Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.
UNK: When you hold it, you feel right.
Chandler : You feel complete.
UNK: - You miss it? - No, not so much.
UNK: All right. Now we smoke.
Ross : Oh, my God!
UNK: - Give me that! - No. You've got options.
UNK: You can smoke like this :
UNK: [scene : - Chandler - Or hold it in your mouth.
UNK: Give me the cigarette!
UNK: - You try. - Thank you.
UNK: Okay, how's this?
UNK: Okay, that's not bad.
UNK: All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it.
UNK: All right, you keep practicing..
UNK: and I'll go put out the sofa.
UNK: I thought it was foot size.
UNK: No. It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb..
Monica : to the tip of his index finger.
Joey : That's ridiculous.
Ross : Can I use either thumb?
UNK: I'd rather go with the foot theory.
UNK: All right. Don't tell me.
UNK: Decaf cappuccino for Joey.
Rachel : Coffee, black.
UNK: Latte.
Rachel : And an iced tea.
UNK: - I'm getting good at this. - Excellent!
Rachel : Good for me!
UNK: - You okay, Phoebe? - It's not worth
Phoebe : It's my bank.
Monica : - What did they do? - It's nothing
UNK: I get my mail and open their monthly "statement."
UNK: Easy!
UNK: And there's $500 extra in my account.
Chandler : Satan's minions at work again!
UNK: Now I have to go deal with them
Joey : - What are you talking about? Keep it! - It's not mine.
UNK: If I kept it, I'd be stealing.
Rachel : But if you spent it, it would be like shopping.
UNK: Say I bought a great pair of shoes.
Phoebe : Know what I'd hear with every step? "Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."
Phoebe : Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear :
UNK: "Not-not mine. Not-not mine."
Monica : We're with you. We got it.
Phoebe : I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be this giant karmic debt.
Rachel : Chandler, what are you doing?
Rachel : What are you doing?
UNK: Oh, gross!
Ross : - What is this? - I'm smoking!
Phoebe : You've been so good for three years!
Chandler : And this is my reward.
Ross : Think about what you went through when you quit.
