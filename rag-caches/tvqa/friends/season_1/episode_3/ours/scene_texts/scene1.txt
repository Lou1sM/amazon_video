Ross : So I think Alan..
UNK: is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured.

Rachel : - Alan. - He was unbelievable!
UNK: Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position.
UNK: It was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan..
Rachel : It was like he made us into a team.
UNK: We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.
UNK: Can I ask a question?
UNK: Do you think Alan is sometimes..
UNK: What?
UNK: I don't know. A little too "Alan"?
UNK: Oh, no. Not possible. You can never be too "Alan."
UNK: It's his innate "Alan-ness" that we adore.
