Lizzie : Keep the change.
UNK: Thanks, Lizzy.
UNK: Want a pretzel?
UNK: - No, I'm fine. Thanks. - See you.
Ross : A thumb?
UNK: I know. There it was, just floating..
Phoebe : like this tiny little hitchhiker.
Chandler : Maybe it's a contest. Like "collect all five."
Phoebe : - Does anyone wanna see? - No, thanks!
UNK: Don't do that. Come on!
Rachel : It's worse than the thumb.
Chandler : - This is so unfair. - Why is it unfair?
Chandler : So I have a flaw! Big deal!
UNK: Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
UNK: Ross, over-pronouncing every word.
UNK: Monica, who snorts when she laughs. I mean, what the hell is that thing?
UNK: I accept those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this?
Joey : Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?
