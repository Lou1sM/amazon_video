Joey : -Yeah, what else? -You're not there.
Ross : -We're not having this conversation. -All right, I'll start. Ready?

Joey : ...you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Joey : -Now you say something. -I really don't think so.
Joey : You like this woman, right? You wanna see her again, right?
Joey : If you can't talk dirty to me, how will you talk dirty to her?
