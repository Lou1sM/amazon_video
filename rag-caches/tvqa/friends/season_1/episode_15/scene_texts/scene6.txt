UNK: These are rock shrimp ravioli in a cilantro ponzu sauce...
UNK: ...with just a touch of minced...
UNK: ...ginger.
Steve : Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!
Steve : -These are fantastic! -Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.
UNK: Like them? I could eat 100 of them!
UNK: That's all there is of these...
UNK: ...but in a few minutes, we'll serve some tartlets.
UNK: "Tartlets"?
UNK: "Tartlets."
UNK: "Tartlets."
Steve : Word has lost all meaning.
Rachel : Excuse me. Can I help you with anything?
Steve : You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Steve : Cool! Taco shells!
Steve : They're like a little corn envelope, you know?
UNK: -You don't wanna spoil your appetite. -Hey, Sugar-O's!
Monica : You know, if you just wait another 6 1 /2 minutes
Steve : Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Monica : -No, we don't. -Oh, okay.
UNK: Sorry.
Monica : Why don't you just have a seat here?
UNK: -Give me the gummy bears. -No.
Monica : -Give them to me. -We'll share.
UNK: -No. Give me the bears. -You can't have any.
UNK: It's not worth it!
UNK: Bears overboard! They're drowning!
UNK: Don't just stand there. Call 9-1 -1.
UNK: Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O! Save yourselves!
UNK: Help! Help, I'm drowning!
Monica : -That's it! Dinner is over! -What! Why?
UNK: Why? What if I came into your office and I started...?
UNK: I can't think of an example.
Monica : I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this...
UNK: ...and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes for a tartlet?
UNK: So I told him, "I'm sorry. That's how I feel."
UNK: And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.
UNK: Then I said, "Don't eat that. It's a kitchen magnet."
UNK: And he didn't listen, so we left him in the emergency room.
UNK: -Mon, I'm sorry. -What a tool.
UNK: -You did the right thing. -You don't wanna work for that guy.
UNK: I just thought that this was it.
UNK: -Don't worry. You're an amazing chef. -Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
UNK: Am I gonna get paid for the full three hours?
UNK: Just a question. We'll talk about it later.
UNK: So, how did it go with Celia?
Ross : -I was unbelievable. -All right, Ross!
Ross : I was the James Michener of dirty talk.
Ross : It was the most elaborate filth ever heard.
Ross : I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif.
Ross : At one point, there were villagers.
UNK: And?
UNK: By the time we finished all the dirty talk...
UNK: ...it was late and we were exhausted
Joey : -You cuddled. -Yeah, which was nice.
UNK: Do you guys want to try to catch a late movie?
Rachel : -Shouldn't we wait for Chandler? -Where the hell is he?
Chandler : I know what time it is...
Chandler : ...but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Chandler : Let me tell you something.
Chandler : You will care about it because I care about it. Got it? Good!
Phoebe : How's this?
Phoebe : Sorry. How about over here?
UNK: That means it's working.
Phoebe : -Does this hurt? -No.
UNK: How about this?
Joey : There you go!
UNK: I'm gonna throw up!
