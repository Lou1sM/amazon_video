UNK: Okay, try this salmon mousse.
UNK: Good.
Monica : Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Joey : -It's creamier. -Yeah? Well, is that better?
Chandler : I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish.
Joey : I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.
Rachel : God, what happened to you?
Chandler : Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests...
Chandler : ...intelligence tests, personality tests, and what do I learn?
UNK: "You're suited for data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Phoebe : That's so great! You already know how to do that.
Chandler : Can you believe it?
UNK: Don't I seem like I should be doing something cool?
Chandler : I just always pictured myself doing something....
UNK: Something!
Rachel : Chandler, I know, I know.
Rachel : Hey, you can see your nipples through this shirt.
Monica : Maybe this will cheer you up.
Chandler : I had a grape about five hours ago, so I better split this with you.
UNK: It's supposed to be small. It's a pre-appetizer.
UNK: The French call it an amuse-bouche.
UNK: Well, it is amusing.
UNK: Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8 : 00.
UNK: What did we say, $10 an hour?
UNK: Okay, great. All right, I'll see you then.
UNK: -$10 an hour for what? -A waitress from work is helping me.
UNK: Waitressing?
Monica : Of course I thought of you. But....
UNK: -But.... -But, but....
UNK: But it's just this night has to go just perfect, you know?
Monica : Wendy's more of a professional waitress.
UNK: And I'm maintaining my amateur status so I can waitress in the Olympics.
Chandler : I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '76.
UNK: Took home a bronze.
UNK: Amuse-bouche?
Celia : Talk to me.
Ross : A weird thing happened on the train this morning
Celia : Talk dirty.
UNK: -Here? -Come on. Come on.
Celia : Say something hot.
Celia : What? What?
UNK: Vulva.
UNK: Vulva?
UNK: I panicked, all right? She took me by surprise.
Ross : But it wasn't a total loss. We ended up cuddling.
Joey : You cuddled? How many times?
Ross : Shut up. It was nice.
Ross : I don't think I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.
UNK: Just say what you wanna do to her. Or what you want her to do to you.
UNK: Or what other people might be doing to each other.
Joey : I'll tell you what. Try something on me.
Ross : Please be kidding.
Joey : Why not?
Joey : Just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Ross : I'm in my apartment....
Joey : -Yeah, what else? -You're not there.
Ross : -We're not having this conversation. -All right, I'll start. Ready?
Joey : Oh, Ross...
Joey : ...you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Joey : -Now you say something. -I really don't think so.
Joey : You like this woman, right? You wanna see her again, right?
Joey : If you can't talk dirty to me, how will you talk dirty to her?
Joey : Now tell me you wanna caress my butt!
UNK: Okay, turn around.
UNK: I don't want you staring at me.
UNK: All right, I'm not looking. Go ahead.
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : I want Okay, I want...
Ross : ...to feel your hot, soft skin with my lips.
Joey : There you go. IKeep going, keep going.
Ross : I want to take my tongue and
Joey : Say it.
Joey : Say it!
Ross : run it all over your body...
Ross : ... until you're trembling with
UNK: With?
Ross : -Funny story. -You're not gonna believe this.
Chandler : I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
UNK: -The trembling thing was nice. -Shut up!
Joey : That guy from your old job called again.
UNK: -Again? -And again and again and again.
Joey : And again.
UNK: Hey, Mr. Costilick. How's life on the 1 5th floor?
Chandler : Yeah, I miss you too.
