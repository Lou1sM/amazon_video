UNK: Hi.
Rachel : He doesn't speak much English.
UNK: Monopoly!
Rachel : Look at that!
Ross : So, where did Paolo come from?
Rachel : Italy, I think.
Ross : No, I mean tonight. Suddenly, into our lives.
UNK: That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?
Ross : That is funny. And Rachel keeps touching him.
UNK: I looked all over and couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
UNK: I found him. It was Paolo's cat.
Phoebe : Well, there you go. Last to know again.
UNK: And I'm guessing, this is Paolo?
Rachel : Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Phoebe : You betcha!
UNK: All right. Okay. What next?
Chandler : Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.
Chandler : It's got a boyish charm. It's impish.
Phoebe : Here we go.
