Rachel : Do you think there are people that go through life...
Rachel : ... never having that kind of...?

Ross : Every day I get a little bit closer to
UNK: Priesthood!
Joey : I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.
UNK: She just ran her fingers through my hair.
UNK: -Were you missing that interaction? -No, no, no.
UNK: This is running fingers through your hair, okay?
UNK: Now this is a tousle.
Joey : If you don't ask her out soon, you'll be in the zone forever.
Ross : I will, I will. I'm waiting for the right moment.
UNK: What?
Ross : -What, now? -Yeah.
Joey : What's messing you up? The wine? The moonlight?
UNK: You gotta go up to her and say, " Look, Rachel, l"

Monica : -What? What? -Don't you hear that?
UNK: See?
UNK: -Would you like gum? -ls it sugarless?
Jill : -Sorry, it's not. -Then no, thanks.

UNK: You gotta promise you'll never tell Ross that I told you.
UNK: -What? -He's planning your birthday party.
Monica : -Oh, my God! I love him! -You better act surprised.
Monica : -About what? -My surprise party.
Phoebe : -What surprise party? -Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.
Phoebe : He didn't tell me.
UNK: Don't look at me. This is Ross' thing.
UNK: This is typical. I'm always the last to know.
Monica : You are not. We tell you stuff.
Phoebe : I was the last one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock.
UNK: I was the last to know you had a crush on Joey.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Looks like I was second to last.
UNK: You had a crush on me?
UNK: All right. It wasn't a crush, it was a dent.
UNK: Big dent?
UNK: You were moving your furniture. I thought you had nice arms.
UNK: Nice arms, huh?

UNK: Do anything for you?
