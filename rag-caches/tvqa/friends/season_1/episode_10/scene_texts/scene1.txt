UNK: Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.
Phoebe : I just wanna be with him all the time.
UNK: You know, day and night. And night and day.
Phoebe : And special occasions.
UNK: I see. You're gonna ask him to New Year's.
Chandler : -She's gonna break the pact. -No! No, no.
Phoebe : No. Yeah, could I just?
UNK: -Yeah. I already asked Janice. -What?
Ross : This was a pact! This was your pact!
Chandler : I couldn't handle the pressure. I snapped!
UNK: But that was the worst breakup in history!
Chandler : I'm not saying it was a good idea. I snapped!
Joey : Hi, sorry I'm late.
Chandler : Too many jokes.
Chandler : Must mock Joey.
Joey : Nice shoes, huh?
UNK: God, you're killing me!
Monica : Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again!
Ross : -He's not gonna hurt them, right? -Do you always have to bring him?
Ross : I didn't wanna leave him alone. We had our first fight this morning.
Ross : It has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.
UNK: He threw some feces.
UNK: If you're working late, I can look in on him.
Ross : That would be great!
UNK: But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.
UNK: You're not doing it for me.
Chandler : Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
David : But you can't actually test this theory.
UNK: T oday's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough...
David : -...to simulate these conditions. -I have a question then.
UNK: -Yeah? -Do you plan on kissing me ever?
David : That's definitely a valid question, and the answer...
UNK: ...would be yes. Yes, I was.
UNK: But I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss...
UNK: ...at a phenomenal moment because it's you.
UNK: Sure.
David : The longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
UNK: Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where l...
David : ...sweep everything off the table.
David : And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.
UNK: David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.
Phoebe : I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.
UNK: -Really? -I'm sure.
UNK: You should just do it. Just throw me.
UNK: -Now? -Yeah, right now. Just....
David : Okay. Okay. Okay.
UNK: You know what? This is really expensive.
UNK: And this was a gift.
UNK: -Now you' re just tidying up. -Okay.
UNK: -You want me to throw you? -I can hop.
UNK: T ell me something, what does " no-date pact" mean to you?
Monica : It's just that Chandler and Phoebe have somebody.
Monica : I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Chandler : -Your ex-boyfriend? -Yeah.
Joey : -You know more than one Fun Bobby? -I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Rachel : -Okay. Here we go. -There's no room for milk.
Rachel : There. Now there is.
Ross : So on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
UNK: -Four. -Five.
Rachel : Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Joey : And I met this really hot single mom at the store.
Joey : What's an elf to do?
UNK: So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops?
Rachel : We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.
UNK: I'll know. This is so not what I needed right now.
Monica : -What's the matter? -Oh, it's Marcel.
UNK: He's angry with me. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.
Ross : He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.
UNK: That's weird. I had a blast with him.
UNK: -Really? -We played, watched TV.
Chandler : That juggling thing is amazing.
