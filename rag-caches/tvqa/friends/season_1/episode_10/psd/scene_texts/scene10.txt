Chandler : Must mock Joey.
Joey : Nice shoes, huh?
UNK: God, you're killing me!
Monica : Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again!
Ross : -He's not gonna hurt them, right? -Do you always have to bring him?
Ross : I didn't wanna leave him alone. We had our first fight this morning.
Ross : It has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.
UNK: He threw some feces.
UNK: If you're working late, I can look in on him.
Ross : That would be great!
UNK: But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.
