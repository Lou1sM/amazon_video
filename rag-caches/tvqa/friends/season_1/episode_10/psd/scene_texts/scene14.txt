Rachel : There. Now there is.
Ross : So on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
UNK: -Four. -Five.
Rachel : Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Joey : And I met this really hot single mom at the store.
Joey : What's an elf to do?
UNK: So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops?
Rachel : We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.
UNK: I'll know. This is so not what I needed right now.
Monica : -What's the matter? -Oh, it's Marcel.
UNK: He's angry with me. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.
