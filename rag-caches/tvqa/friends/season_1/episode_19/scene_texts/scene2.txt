Rachel : We were watching TV, he pooped in Monica's shoe....
Monica : Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Rachel : I don't know. The left one!
Monica : Which ones?
Rachel : Those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Phoebe : Why is the air in here so negative?
Chandler : Rachel lost Marcel.
Phoebe : Oh, no! How?
Monica : -He pooped in my shoe. -Which one?
UNK: The cute black ones I always wear.
Phoebe : No, which one?
Phoebe : The right or left?
UNK: Because the left one is lucky.
Ross : Come on! What am I gonna do?
UNK: All right. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city.
Joey : Where do you go?
Chandler : It's his first time out, so he'll do touristy things.
Chandler : I'll go to Cats. You go to the Russian Tea Room.
Rachel : Oh, my God! Come on, you guys!
UNK: He'll be home any minute. He's gonna kill me!
UNK: Search the building. Take the first floor. We'll take the rest.

UNK: You know how we were talking before...
Ross : ...about relationships, and stuff.
Rachel : -Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this! -Okay, quick and painful.

UNK: Okay, all right. All right, okay.
Rachel : Please don't hate me.
UNK: What?
UNK: You know Marcel?

Ross : I can't believe this.
Ross : All I asked you to do was keep him in here!
Rachel : I know. I'm sorry.

Rachel : -Who is it? -Animal Control.

Ross : Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
UNK: I'm not allowed to have him. If they find him, they'll take him away.
UNK: Well, now, see, you never ever told us that.
UNK: Because I never expected you to invite them to the apartment!
Rachel : Thanks for coming.
Luisa : Somebody called about a monkey?
UNK: You know, that was a complete misunderstanding.
Ross : We thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.
Rachel : -Turned out it was a hat. -Cat!
UNK: We checked, no one's seen Marcel.
Ross : -My uncle Marcel. -ls that who the monkey's named after?
Luisa : Possession of an illegal exotic is punishable...
UNK: ... by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Monica : Remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Phoebe : Yes, but there isn't always time.
Monica : I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Have a seat.
UNK: We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.
Luisa : Oh, my God, you are!
