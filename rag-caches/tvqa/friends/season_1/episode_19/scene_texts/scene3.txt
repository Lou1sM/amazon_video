UNK: And you're Rachel Greene!
Luisa : Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?
UNK: I sat behind you guys in homeroom.
Rachel : Luisa! Oh, my God!
Rachel : Monica! It's Luisa!
UNK: I went there too!
UNK: Luisa! From homeroom!
Luisa : You have no idea who I am, do you?
UNK: -No. -Not at all.
Luisa : Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.
UNK: Would it have been hard to say, "Morning, Luisa"...
UNK: ...or "Nice overalls"?
UNK: Oh, I'm so sorry!
Luisa : It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems.
Luisa : But you. What a bitch!
UNK: What?
UNK: You know what? Be that as it may...
UNK: ...could you help us with the monkey thing, for old times'sake?
Monica : Go, Bobcats!
Luisa : I could. But I won't.
Luisa : If I find that monkey, he's mine.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Marcel?
UNK: Marcel?
