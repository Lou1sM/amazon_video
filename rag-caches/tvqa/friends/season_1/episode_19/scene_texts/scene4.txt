UNK: Woman No. 1 : Hi, can I help you?
UNK: We're having an emergency, and we were looking for something.
Joey : -A monkey. -Yes, have you seen any?
UNK: No, I haven't seen a monkey.
UNK: Can you fix radiators?
UNK: Sure! Did you try turning the knob back the other way?
UNK: Woman No. 1 : -Of course! -Oh. Then, no.
UNK: -Taste this. Is there too much rum? -Just a second.
UNK: Woman No. 1 : -Hope you find your monkey. -No, wait!
UNK: We may not know about radiators...
UNK: ... but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu.
UNK: Aren't we in the middle of something?
Chandler : But these women are very hot, and they need our help.
Chandler : And they're very hot!
UNK: We can't, all right?
Joey : We're sorry.
UNK: You don't know how sorry. We promised to find this monkey.
UNK: He's this high and answers to the name Marcel.
UNK: So if we could get pictures of you, it'd help us out.
Chandler : From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
