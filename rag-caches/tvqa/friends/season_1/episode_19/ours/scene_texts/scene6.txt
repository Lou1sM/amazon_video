Monica : Oh, gosh!
UNK: We've been all over the neighborhood! He's just gone!
Rachel : -You don't know that. -It's cold, it's dark.
Ross : He doesn't know the Village!
Ross : And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey and a broken foot!
Ross : Thank you very much!
UNK: I've said I'm sorry a million times.
Rachel : What do you want me to do?
Rachel : You want me to break my foot too? I'll break it right now.
Rachel : Oh, my God! There, are you happy now?
UNK: Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...
UNK: ... I don't miss Marcel anymore!
UNK: It's not like I did this on purpose.
Ross : No, this is just vintage Rachel.
Ross : Things just sort of happen around you!
UNK: You're off in "Rachel Land," doing your "Rachel Thing"...
Ross : ...oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and
UNK: I don't want to hear it! Forget it, okay?
UNK: What?
UNK: Hey, banana man!
Phoebe : This is so intense!
Phoebe : One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.
UNK: -What's with Phoebe? -Tranquilizer dart.
Ross : Hi! Did you order some bananas?
UNK: Mr. Heckles : -What about it? -Give me my monkey back!
UNK: Mr. Heckles : -I don't have a monkey. -Then what's with the bananas?
UNK: Potassium.
Ross : Okay, where is he?
UNK: You're wasting your time.
UNK: What?
UNK: -What have you done to him? -That's my monkey. That's Patty.
UNK: Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.
UNK: Come here, Patty.
UNK: Come here, Marcel.
UNK: Come here, Patty.
Luisa : Here, monkey.
Luisa : Here, monkey!
UNK: Gotcha!
UNK: -Give me my monkey back! -It's mine.
Luisa : Take this up with the judge.
UNK: That's not my monkey. The dress is mine. Send it back whenever.
UNK: All right, I want my monkey!
UNK: -Oh, come on, Luisa. -Sorry, prom queen.
UNK: You had to be a bitch in school, instead of fat.
UNK: In high school, I was prom queen...
UNK: ...and the homecoming queen and you...
Rachel : ...were also there.
UNK: But this isn't high school. We're all adults here!
UNK: Heckles! Can I have this?
UNK: For the most part.
Rachel : If you take this monkey, I'll lose an important person in my life.
Rachel : You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.
Rachel : You have a chance to be the bigger person here.
UNK: Mr. Heckles : Take it!
UNK: No.
UNK: All right. Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her...
UNK: ...you shot my friend with a dart!
Ross : It'll be nice to get this off, won't it?
UNK: Or we can leave it on. That's fine.
UNK: With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
UNK: Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before
UNK: No, it was my fault. I almost lost your
UNK: Yeah, but you got him back. You were great.
UNK: We still have that bottle of wine.
UNK: Are you in the mood for something grape?
UNK: -Sure, that would be good. -All right.
UNK: The neighbors must be vacuuming.
UNK: Well, as long as we're here...
Ross : ...and not on the subject....
Ross : I was thinking about...
Ross : ... how mad we got at each other before.
UNK: And maybe it was partially because of how we
UNK: -Rachel? -Barry?
Barry : I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.
Barry : I think I'm still in love with you.
Ross : We have got to start locking that door!
UNK: Show us! Come on!
UNK: -lt was such a long time ago. -Okay, fine. All right.
Monica : This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Monica : That's because I'm in front of them.
UNK: Big nun!
Chandler : I thought that was an alp.
UNK: High school wasn't my favorite time.
Joey : I loved high school.
UNK: It was four years of parties, dating and sex and
Chandler : Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys.
Chandler : Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Monica : Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Phoebe : My butt cheek is waking up!
