Monica : -Last night. -Really?
UNK: So, his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?
Ross : Just a dream I had.
Ross : But, phew!
Phoebe : Hey, she's on.
Paolo : Nora Bing.
UNK: Back to the book. What is this about you being arrested in London?
Phoebe : Your mom was arrested?
UNK: I'm busy beaming with pride.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : This is kind of embarrassing...
UNK: Mrs. Bing : ...but occasionally, after I've been intimate with a man...
Chandler : Why would she say that's embarrassing?
UNK: Mrs. Bing : ...I just get this craving for kung pao chicken.
Chandler : That's too much information.
UNK: Needless to say, he got a huge tip.
UNK: Oh, God, I Iove her!
UNK: I think I' m having a stroke.
UNK: So how is your book tour going?
UNK: Mrs. Bing : Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : But I get to see my son, who I love.
Chandler : This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
UNK: Don 't take this wrong, I just don 't see you as a mom.
UNK: -I don 't mean that bad. -Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : I bought my son his first condoms.
