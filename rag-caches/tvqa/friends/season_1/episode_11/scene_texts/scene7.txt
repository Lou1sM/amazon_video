Chandler : Just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom...
Chandler : ...doesn't mean you know her. You can't talk to her.
UNK: Okay. "You can't"? Or you can't?
Ross : Okay, that's my finger.
UNK: Okay, that's my knee.
Ross : Still doing the play.
UNK: What did you do with him?
Monica : -You're awake. -Look at you.
Phoebe : How do you feel?
UNK: A Iittle woozy, but basically okay.
UNK: Gosh, you Iook good.
UNK: Coma Guy : I feel good.
UNK: Coma Guy : Who are you?
UNK: -Sorry. -I'm Phoebe.
UNK: I' m Monica. I've been caring for you.
Phoebe : We both have.
UNK: -The Etch A Sketch is from you? -Actually, me.
Monica : -I got you the foot massager. -I shaved you.
Monica : -I read to you. -I sang.
UNK: Coma Guy : Well, thanks.
Monica : -Oh, my pleasure. -You' re welcome.
UNK: So I guess I'II see you around.
Phoebe : What? That's it?
UNK: "See you around "?
UNK: Coma Guy : -What do you want me to say? -I don't know.
UNK: Maybe...
UNK: ... "That was nice. "
UNK: " It meant something to me. "
UNK: " I'II call you. "
UNK: -Okay. I'II call you. -I don't think you mean that.
Monica : This is so typical.
UNK: You know, we give and we give...
Monica : ...and we give.
UNK: And we just get nothing back.
UNK: And then one day, you wake up, and it's, "See you around. "
Monica : Let's go, Phoebe.
UNK: You know what? We thought you were different.
Phoebe : But I guess it was just the coma.
UNK: The car's waiting. I just wanted to drop off my book for your friends.
UNK: Autographed. And give you a goodbye kiss.
UNK: Here's the kiss, here's the goodbye....
UNK: Mrs. Bing : -Anything you want from Lisbon? -Just knowing you' re there is enough.
UNK: AII right. Well, be good. I Iove you.
Chandler : You kissed my best Ross.
Chandler : Or something to that effect.
UNK: Look, it was stupid.
Chandler : -Really stupid. -Really stupid.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : I don't even know how it happened.
UNK: I' m sorry, honey. I promise it will never happen again.
UNK: Really, really stupid.
UNK: Really, really stupid.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : -Are we okay now? -Yeah.
UNK: No.
UNK: The forbidden Iove of a man and his door.
Joey : He told her off. And not just about the kiss.
Ross : You're kidding?
Joey : He said, "When are you gonna start being a mom? "
UNK: Then she said :
Joey : "The question is, when are you gonna realize I have a bomb? "
UNK: Are you sure she didn't say :
Joey : "When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom? "
Joey : -That makes more sense. -You think?
Ross : What's going on now?
UNK: I don't know. I've been standing here spelling it out for you.
UNK: I don't hear anything. Wait.
UNK: What do you see?
UNK: It's hard to tell. They're tiny and upside down.
Joey : Wait, wait, wait.
Joey : They're walking away. They're walking away.
Joey : No, they' re not. They' re coming right at us. Run!
UNK: -Are you okay, kiddo? -Yeah, I' m okay.
UNK: AII right. You be good.
UNK: Drive safe.
Rachel : -Mrs. Bing. -Mr. Geller.
Phoebe : You mean that?
Chandler : Yeah, why not?
Chandler : So I told her.
UNK: -How did it go? -Awful. Awful.
UNK: Couldn't have gone worse.
UNK: -Well, how do you feel? -Pretty good.
Chandler : I told her.
Ross : Well, see?
Ross : So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, me kissing your mom, huh?
Ross : But we don't have to go down that road.
Rachel : This is just the first chapter...
Rachel : ...and I want your absolute honest opinion. Okay?
Rachel : And on page two, he's not reaching for her " heaving beasts. "
UNK: She could have heaving beasts.
UNK: Right, but in this case she doesn't.
UNK: What's a " niffle"?
UNK: You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.
UNK: Okay, so I' m not a great typist.
Ross : Did you get to the part about his "huge, throbbing pens"?
Ross : You don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those.
UNK: That's it. Give them back.
UNK: Wait, I just got to the part about her "public hair. "
