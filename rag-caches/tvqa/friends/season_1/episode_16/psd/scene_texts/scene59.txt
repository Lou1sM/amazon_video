UNK: And have I mentioned that back in high school I was a cow?
Monica : I used to wet my bed.
Rachel : I use my breasts to get people's attention.
Monica : We both do that!
UNK: Dr. Mitchell : Monica and Rachel's apartment.
UNK: Dr. Mitchell : Just one second. Rachel, it's your dad.
Monica : Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me.
Monica : Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.
Monica : But there's something....
Monica : There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
Joey : -Excuse me. -Remember back in freshman year?
Monica : Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
UNK: Daddy.
UNK: Why? Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?
Rachel : His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead!
UNK: Hey, Rachel? Are these your condoms?
UNK: Oh, no, that was just Monica. She's drunk again.
UNK: I don't think "scrunchy" is a word.
UNK: Why not, if "crunchy" is a word?
UNK: Then I'm using that same argument for "fligament."
