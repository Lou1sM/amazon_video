UNK: I had a dream. I was playing football with my kid.
UNK: Chandler And Joey : -That's nice. -No, no. With him.
Ross : I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.
UNK: I've gotta do something. The Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me!
Joey : -Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. -Right, but...
Ross : ...it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinking they can take us.
UNK: And so I just heave it downfield!
