UNK: Helen, do the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.
Helen : You still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
Chandler : Helen drinks.
Chandler : Will you marry me?
UNK: So after the proposal, I kind of unraveled.
UNK: Right. Because you were really in control up until then.
UNK: -I told her everything. -How'd she take it?
UNK: Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.
UNK: A tip. If you're ever in a similar situation...
UNK: ... never, ever leave your hand on the desk.
