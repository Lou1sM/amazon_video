UNK: I know. I'm just not that bright either.
UNK: Mon, I'm sorry. I don't think you're like your mother.
UNK: That's all right. And I don't think you were selfish.
UNK: Oh, and I'm sorry I said you were a cow.

Joey : -You don't drink. -That's right, I don't.
UNK: -But I was drunk on you. -Oh, Urs
UNK: But it's not gonna work.
Joey : Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Phoebe : Would you stop hanging out with her?
UNK: No, I couldn't do that.
UNK: Then yeah, it's because of Phoebe.
Phoebe : So, you know, it's either her or me.
Joey : Then I'm sorry.
