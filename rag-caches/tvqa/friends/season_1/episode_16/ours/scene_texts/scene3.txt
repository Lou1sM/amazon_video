Phoebe : Good choice.
UNK: -It's definitely her. -Yeah.
UNK: I can't believe you haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job.
UNK: You haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
UNK: Congratulations! You've found the world's thinnest argument.
UNK: I'm finding the right moment.
UNK: That shouldn't be so hard now that you're dating.
UNK: "Honey, you're fired. But how about a quickie before I go to work?"
UNK: Once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore.
UNK: I'll get it.
UNK: -Hi, Mr. Heckles. -You're doing it again.
UNK: We're not doing anything. We're sitting and talking quietly.

UNK: Sure. Yeah. Okay, it fits.
UNK: -Are you seeing her again? -Yep, lce Capades.
UNK: This is serious. I've never known you to pay for any kind of "capade."
UNK: I don't know. I like her.
UNK: She's different. There's something about her
Phoebe : That you like. We get it. You like her. Great!
Joey : Phoebe, I asked you. You said it was okay.

UNK: Okay!
UNK: IKnit, good woman, knit!
UNK: And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
UNK: -Nina! -Mr. Douglas. Cool tie.
UNK: She's still here.
Chandler : Yes. Yes, she is. Didn't I memo you on this?
UNK: After I let her go, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flennan
UNK: Dr. Flennan Dr. Flynn.
UNK: And he informed me that she took the news rather badly.
Chandler : In fact, he mentioned the word "frenzy."
UNK: -You're kidding! She seems so -No. Nina? She's
UNK: If you asked her now...
Chandler : ...she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.
UNK: -That's unbelievable. -And yet believable.
Chandler : So I decided not to fire her again until she'll be no threat to anyone.

UNK: -It's just impossible. -What is, honey?
Carol : What that woman did.
UNK: I am not doing that. It'll just have to stay in.
Carol : Everything will be the same. It'll just stay in.
UNK: -Carol, honey, it'll be all right. -What do you know?
UNK: No one's asking you, "Mind if we push this pot roast through your nostril?"
Susan : Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
UNK: I know it's frightening. But big picture :
Susan : The birth part is just one day.
UNK: When it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives.
UNK: I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross?
UNK: Ross?
Ross : I'm gonna be a father.
UNK: -This is news to you? -I knew I was having a baby.
UNK: I just never realized the baby was having me.
