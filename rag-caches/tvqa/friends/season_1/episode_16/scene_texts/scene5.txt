Rachel : Who did I just put as my emergency person?
Monica : That's insurance fraud.
UNK: All right then, forget it. Might as well just go home.
UNK: -Okay, come here. I hate this. -Thank you. I love you.
UNK: Hi. I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.
UNK: -Why? -I am really an idiot.
UNK: I was filling out her form...
Monica : ...and instead of putting her information I put mine.
Nurse : You are an idiot.
UNK: Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.
UNK: I had a dream. I was playing football with my kid.
UNK: Chandler And Joey : -That's nice. -No, no. With him.
Ross : I'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.
UNK: I've gotta do something. The Tampa Bay defense is coming right at me!
Joey : -Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. -Right, but...
Ross : ...it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinking they can take us.
UNK: And so I just heave it downfield!
Chandler : -What are you, crazy? That's a baby! -He should take the sack?
UNK: Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.
UNK: And I realize I'm the one who's supposed to catch him.
UNK: I know I'm not gonna get there in time.
Ross : So I am running and running. That is when I woke up.
UNK: See? I am so not ready to be a father.
Chandler : You're gonna be fine.
Chandler : You're one of the most caring, responsible men in North America.
Chandler : You're gonna make a great dad.
UNK: Yeah, you and the baby just need better blocking.
UNK: Have you ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?
Chandler : Well, only if you order stuff.
UNK: I'm taking Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Ross : -What about Phoebe's birthday? -When's that?
UNK: -Tonight. -What are the odds of that happening?
Ross : You take your time.
Chandler : There it is!
UNK: -What'll you do? -What can I do?
UNK: I don't wanna screw it up with Ursula.
Chandler : And your friend?
UNK: If she's my friend, she'll understand. Wouldn't you?
UNK: If you tried that on my birthday...
UNK: ...you'd be staring at the end of a hissy fit.
UNK: Saffron makes all the difference.
UNK: -Okay. Monica? -Yes.
Chandler : -Yes, she is. -Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
UNK: -Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell. -And I'm Dr. Rosen.
UNK: I'm okay here.
UNK: Actually, that's all right. You can take your break.
UNK: No, this is why I became a doctor. Ankles and stuff like that.
UNK: -Aren't you too cute to be a doctor? -Excuse me?
UNK: God, young, young. I meant young. Young to be a doctor. Good, Rach.
Rachel : -Thank you. -Right.
Rachel : He said it was just a sprain.
Monica : -You left out the stupid part. -It's not stupid.
UNK: The cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow, and I said yes.
UNK: I think it's insane. They work for the hospital.
Monica : It's like returning to the scene of the crime.
Monica : -I say we blow off the dates. -What? They are cute.
UNK: They are doctors. Cute doctors. Doctors who are cute.
UNK: All right, what have we learned so far?
UNK: Oh, God. Okay.
UNK: Surprise!
Chandler : What are you doing? You scared the crap out of me!
Rachel : -Was that the cake? -Yeah. I got a lemon schmoosh.
Monica : Come on. She'll be here any minute.
Rachel : Hope it's okay.
UNK: "Happy Birthday Peehee."
UNK: Maybe we can make a "B" out of a rose.
Ross : We'll just use our special cake tools.
Phoebe : -What's going on? -We just
UNK: Surprise!
Phoebe : This is so great! Oh, my God! This was not at all scary.
UNK: Look! "Happy Birthday Peehee."
UNK: What a strange new nickname. I like it! Oh, my God!
Phoebe : Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty! Betty, hi!
Phoebe : You found Betty! Oh, my gosh! This is so great.
Phoebe : Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey?
Chandler : Did you see Betty?
UNK: Mr. Geller : I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Five years ago, if somebody had said, "A tomato that's like a prune"...
