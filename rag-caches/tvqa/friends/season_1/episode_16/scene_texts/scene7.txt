UNK: Dr. Mitchell : -How could we resist? -That's great!
UNK: Dr. Rosen : -Monica, how's the ankle? -It's....
UNK: Monica as Rachel : Why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle.
UNK: Rachel as Monica : It's feeling a lot better. Thank you.
UNK: Why don't you guys sit down, and we'll get you some glasses?
UNK: Okay. Stat!
Rachel : Why don't we just tell them who we really are? It'll be fine.
Monica : -We'll get in trouble. -Would you stop being such a wuss?
Monica : A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world.
UNK: -So? -So they still seem normal.
UNK: Dr. Mitchell : Because they are.
UNK: When we go out with women from the hospital
UNK: Relax. Take a look around. There are no pagan altars.
UNK: Dr. Mitchell : No piles of bones in the corners. They're fine. Go like this :
Monica : We're not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a baby!
Rachel : -I am not a baby. -Be serious. Every time
UNK: -You act like a princess. -You know what?
Rachel : Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother. Excuse me.
Rachel : Here we go.
UNK: Dr. Rosen : Great place. How long have you lived here?
Rachel : I've been here about six years.
Rachel : And Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Monica : See, I was supposed to get married, but I left the guy at the altar.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah.
Monica : Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me!
Monica : -Try the hummus. -Monica, what do you do?
UNK: I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.
Teacher : -Good for you. -Yeah, it is.
Rachel : Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
UNK: Dr. Rosen : -This hummus is great. -God bless the chickpea.
Monica : Oh, God! I am so spoiled!
Monica : That's it.
UNK: I shoplift.
UNK: You had no idea that lipstick was in your pocket.
UNK: Did I tell you that I think I'm so much cuter than I am?
UNK: And have I mentioned that back in high school I was a cow?
Monica : I used to wet my bed.
Rachel : I use my breasts to get people's attention.
Monica : We both do that!
UNK: Dr. Mitchell : Monica and Rachel's apartment.
UNK: Dr. Mitchell : Just one second. Rachel, it's your dad.
Monica : Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me.
Monica : Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.
Monica : But there's something....
Monica : There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
Joey : -Excuse me. -Remember back in freshman year?
Monica : Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
UNK: Daddy.
UNK: Why? Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?
Rachel : His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead!
UNK: Hey, Rachel? Are these your condoms?
UNK: Oh, no, that was just Monica. She's drunk again.
UNK: I don't think "scrunchy" is a word.
UNK: Why not, if "crunchy" is a word?
UNK: Then I'm using that same argument for "fligament."
Monica : -Ross, he's got the remote again. -Good.
Ross : Maybe he can switch it back.
Ross : Maybe not.
UNK: Okay, Daddy? That's the other line.
UNK: Okay, no, not even in my bedroom.
UNK: Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Hold on a second. Let me check and see if she's here.
Rachel : It's the woman from the hospital. There's a problem.
UNK: -What do we do? -Just find out what they want.
UNK: Okay. No, you do it.
Monica : Hello. This is Monica. Yeah?
UNK: Oh, okay. Yes, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Monica : We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Rachel : You were right. This was just not worth it. Let me just change.
