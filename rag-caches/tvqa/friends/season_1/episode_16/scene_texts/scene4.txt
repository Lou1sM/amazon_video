UNK: I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.
UNK: -How will I raise a kid? -Some scientists are now saying...
Chandler : ...that monkeys and babies are actually different.

UNK: Yes.
UNK: Can I just ask you one question?
Phoebe : Have you two, you know, like, you know?
Phoebe : You know, yet?
UNK: Not that it's any of your business, but no, we haven't.
Joey : You meant sex, right?
Nina : -Do you have a sec? -Sure. What's up?
UNK: The past few days, people have been avoiding me and giving me weird looks.
UNK: Well, maybe that's because they're jealous of us.
UNK: Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
UNK: Maybe that's because you're getting a big raise!
Susan : -I am? -Sure. Why not?
UNK: Oh, my God! You're amazing!
UNK: You don't know.
UNK: Helen, do the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

Chandler : Helen drinks.
Chandler : Will you marry me?
UNK: So after the proposal, I kind of unraveled.
UNK: Right. Because you were really in control up until then.

UNK: ... never, ever leave your hand on the desk.

UNK: She didn't mean to do it but I think it still counts.
UNK: And then there's Randy Brown, who was like
Phoebe : Have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend?
UNK: That's what he was for me.
UNK: And she kind of stole him away and then broke his heart.
UNK: Then he wouldn't talk to me anymore.
UNK: He didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.
UNK: I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my thermos...
Phoebe : ...or anything, but
UNK: -You won't lose him. -You gotta talk to Joey.
UNK: -lf he knew how you felt -But he's falling in love with her.
