UNK: Unbelievable! It's been half an hour.
Chandler : If this was a cartoon, you'd look like a ham now.
UNK: -There's the waitress. Hello, miss! -It's Phoebe!
Ursula : -Okay, will that be all? -Wait. What are you doing here?
Ursula : I was over there. Then you said, "Hello, miss." So I'm here.
Joey : No, how come you're working here?
UNK: Because it's close to where I live, and the aprons are cute.
Chandler : -Can we start over? -Okay, I'm gonna be over here.
Joey : I don't know whether he's testing me...
Ross : ... but my monkey is out of control!
Ross : He keeps erasing the messages on my machine.
UNK: Supposedly by accident.
UNK: Oh, yeah, I've done that.
UNK: And then he got to the newspaper before I did...
Ross : ...and peed all over the crossword!
UNK: I've never done that.
UNK: Last night, I don't know what he did but there were capers everywhere!
UNK: -She looks exactly like her sister. -I'm saying I see a difference.
UNK: They're twins.
UNK: I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot!
UNK: You know how we talk about things?
UNK: -Let's not do that anymore. -All right.
Joey : -Pheebs, guess who we saw today? -Oh, fun! Okay.
Phoebe : -Liam Neeson. -No.
UNK: -Morley Safer. -No.
UNK: -The lady who cuts my hair! -This could be a very long game.
Chandler : -Your sister, Ursula. -Oh, really?
UNK: -She works at that place.... -Riff's. I know.
UNK: You do? She said you guys haven't talked in years.
Phoebe : So, is she fat?
UNK: Not from where I was standing.
Phoebe : Where were you standing?
Rachel : Pheebs, so you guys just don't get along?
UNK: It's mostly just dumb sister stuff.
Phoebe : Everyone always thought of her as the pretty one.
UNK: She was the first to walk even though I did it later that same day.
Phoebe : But to my parents, by then it was, "Yeah, what else is new?"
UNK: I'm sorry. I've gotta go. I've got Lamaze class.
UNK: And I've got earth science, but I'll catch you in gym?
UNK: -ls this just gonna be you and Carol? -Susan will be there too.
UNK: We've got dads, we've got lesbians. The whole parenting team.
UNK: -lsn't that gonna be weird? -lt might have been at first...
UNK: ... but now I'm comfortable with it.
UNK: -Ross, that's my jacket. -I know.
UNK: Hi. We're the Rostens. I'm J. C. and he's Michael.
UNK: And we're having a boy and a girl.
Teacher : Good for you. All right, next?
UNK: I'm Ross Geller. And that's my boy in there.
UNK: And this is Carol Willick. And this is Susan Bunch.
UNK: Susan is Carol's....
UNK: Who's next?
UNK: Sorry, Susan is...?
UNK: -Carol's friend. -Life partner.
Ross : Like buddies.
Susan : -Like lovers. -You know how close women can get.
UNK: -We live together. -I was married to her.
Susan : -Carol, not me. -It's a bit complicated.
UNK: -But we're fine. -Absolutely!
Ross : So, twins! That's like two births.
UNK: Ouch!
Chandler : to you too, Helen.
Helen : -Nina Bookbinder is here to see you. -Okay, send her in.
Chandler : -Come on in. -You wanted to see me?
UNK: I was reviewing your data. You've been postdating your Friday numbers.
Nina : -Which is bad, because...? -lt throws my WENUS out of whack.
Joey : -Excuse me? -WENUS.
UNK: Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.
UNK: Gotcha!
UNK: Won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your WENUS.
UNK: I'll take "ldiots in the Workplace" for 200, Alex.
UNK: It's not just that she's cute, okay? It's just that...
UNK: ...she's really, really cute.
UNK: It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
UNK: God, I even know that and I'm pretty much unemployable.
UNK: Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
