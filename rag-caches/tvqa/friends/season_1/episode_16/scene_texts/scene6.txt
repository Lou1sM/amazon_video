UNK: ... I'd have said, "Get out!"
Ross : Dad, before I was born, did you freak out?
UNK: I'm not freaking out! I'm saying, if someone had come to me
UNK: Dad, I'm talking about the whole baby thing.
Ross : Did you ever get this sort of...
Ross : ... panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" thing?
UNK: No. We just had kids back then.
UNK: We didn't think about it. What else could the sun dry, I wonder?
UNK: Dad, come on. IKids.
UNK: Look, your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
UNK: No, I was just wondering.
UNK: We can make up for that. We can do stuff together.
UNK: You always wanted to go to Colonial Williamsburg. Let's do that.
Ross : Thanks, Dad, really. You know, I just....
Ross : I just needed to know...
Ross : ...when did you start to feel like a father?
UNK: Well, I guess it must've been the day after you were born.
UNK: Mr. Geller : We were in the hospital room, your mom was asleep...
UNK: Mr. Geller : ...and they brought you in and gave you to me.
UNK: Mr. Geller : You were this ugly little red thing.
UNK: Mr. Geller : All of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your fist...
UNK: Mr. Geller : ...and you squeezed it so tight.
UNK: Mr. Geller : And that's when I knew.
UNK: Mr. Geller : So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Ross : We can go to Williamsburg.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Eat your fish.
Monica : -Rachel, the cute doctors are here! -Okay, coming.
Monica : -Hi, come on in. -Hi, Jeffrey.
UNK: Dr. Rosen : We brought wine.
UNK: Look. It's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.
