UNK: Dr. Baldhara : It's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
UNK: Dr. Baldhara : Let me ask you some questions about Marcel.
UNK: Dr. Baldhara : -Does he fight with other animals? -No, no. He's very docile.
UNK: Dr. Baldhara : Even if he were cornered?
UNK: Well, I don't know. Why?
UNK: Dr. Baldhara : How is he at handling small objects?
Ross : He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.
UNK: What about a hammer or a small blade?
Ross : Why would he need a blade?
UNK: Dr. Baldhara : If he's up against an animal with horns...
UNK: ...you got to give him something.
UNK: Dr. Baldhara : Otherwise, it's just cruel.
UNK: -He got into San Diego. -What?
UNK: We came back from our walk. The phone was ringing....
Ross : He's in.
Ross : Did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego.
UNK: You're making a mistake. San Diego's good...
UNK: ... but I'll start him off against a blind rabbit...
UNK: ...and give you 20% of the gate.
