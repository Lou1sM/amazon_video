UNK: Mother, just once, can we go to lunch...
UNK: ...and not talk about what I'm wearing or where my career is going?
UNK: Or who I'm dating.
UNK: -Ready for the check? -God, yes.
UNK: -I'll take it. -No, darling.
UNK: I said I'll take it. Here, take it. Go. Run.
UNK: Very sweet.
UNK: -And on what they pay you -Career.
UNK: You don't have to worry about me. I'm doing fine.
UNK: I'm afraid this has been denied.
UNK: That's impossible.
UNK: That's all right, dear. Here you go.
