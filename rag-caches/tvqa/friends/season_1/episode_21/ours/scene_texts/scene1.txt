UNK: The One With The Fake Monica
UNK: How'd someone get your card number?
Monica : No idea. Look how much they spent.
Rachel : You only have to pay for the stuff you bought.
UNK: Still, it's just such reckless spending.
UNK: When somebody steals...
UNK: ...they've already thrown caution to the wind.
Chandler : Wow, what a geek. They spent $69. 95 on a Wonder Mop.
Monica : That's me.
UNK: You see, when I say geek, I mean
UNK: The hell with it, you bought a $70 mop, you're a geek.
UNK: Oh, yuck. Ross, he's doing it again.
Ross : Marcel, stop humping the lamp.
Ross : Stop humping. Now, Marcel, come Come here, Marcel.
Rachel : Oh, no. Not in my room. I'll get him.
UNK: You've got to do something about that.
UNK: What? It's just a phase.
Chandler : Well, that's what we said about Joey.
UNK: You'd think you would be more understanding.
UNK: I know. But we're not.
Ross : Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
UNK: -Marcel, stop it. Marcel. Bad monkey. -What?
UNK: Let's say my Curious George is no longer curious.
Rachel : You are not still going over that thing.
Monica : -This woman's living my life. -What?
Monica : She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me.
Monica : Look at this. Look. She buys tickets to plays I wanna see.
UNK: She shops where I'm afraid of the salespeople.
UNK: -She spent $300 on art supplies. -You're not an artist.
Monica : I might be if I had the supplies.
Monica : I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
UNK: Oh, Monica, come on. You do cool things.
UNK: Really? Let's compare, shall we?
UNK: Oh, it's so late for "shall we."
UNK: Do I horseback ride in the park?
Monica : -Do I take classes at the New School? -No.
Monica : She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
UNK: -How about Joey Paponi? -No, still too ethnic.
UNK: -My agent wants a more neutral name. -Joey Switzerland?
UNK: Plus, I think it should be Joe. Joey makes me sound like I'm this big :
Joey : Which I'm not.
UNK: Joe, Joe, Joe Stalin?
UNK: Stalin.
Joey : Do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Chandler : Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
UNK: But you're more plugged into that show business thing.
Joey : Joe Stalin.
UNK: You know, that's pretty good.
UNK: You might wanna try Joseph.
Joey : Joseph Stalin.
Joey : -I think you'd remember that. -Yes.
Chandler : Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.
Chandler : Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Monica : Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.
Monica : I'm taking some classes with you, and I was wondering what they were.
UNK: I've had a recent head injury and certain numbers
UNK: Barbecue. Oh, did l? See, there you go.
Phoebe : -What are you doing? -All right, great.
Monica : Great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
UNK: To dance with the woman that stole your card?
UNK: To see what she looks like.
Rachel : I'm sure her picture's up at the post office.
Monica : I should get to see who she is.
UNK: You're kind of losing it here. This is becoming a weird obsession.
UNK: This is madness, I tell you.
Phoebe : For the love of God, Monica, don't do it.
Phoebe : Thank you.
UNK: -What do you think? -Lots of things.
UNK: -Which one is she? -May I help you?
Monica : No, thanks. We're just here to observe.
Teacher : You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class.
UNK: Spare shoes are over there.
Rachel : What does she mean?
Phoebe : I think she means "You dance a dance class."
UNK: -Come on, come on, come on. -Really?
UNK: Do you see anybody you think could be me?
UNK: Last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class.
Teacher : -Let's not have that happen again. -She could be you.
