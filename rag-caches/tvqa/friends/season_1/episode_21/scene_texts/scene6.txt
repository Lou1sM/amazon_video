UNK: I've been worried Monica.
Monica : Water rules.
Rachel : Yes. Yes, it does.
Rachel : The restaurant called. They wanna know if you're showing up for work.
Monica : Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel : You're gonna lose your job. This is not you.
Monica : No, it is me.
Monica : I'm not just the person who fluffs the pillows...
UNK: ...and pays the bills right away.
UNK: You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that.
Monica : I'm Monana.
Rachel : Hello? Yes, she is. Hold on a second please.

Monica : How are you?
UNK: Fake Monica : Not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my color.
UNK: Fake Monica : How did you know I was here?
Monica : Because I'm Monica Geller.
Monica : It was my credit card you were using.
UNK: Fake Monica : That I was not expecting.
Monica : I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.
UNK: -Thanks. -No, thank you.
Monica : You have given me so much.
Monica : I'd never have gotten to sing...
UNK: ... "Memories" at the Winter Garden Theater.
UNK: Fake Monica : Actually, you only got to sing "Memo"
UNK: I can't believe you're here. What will I do without you?
Monica : Who's gonna crash parties with me?
Monica : Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
UNK: Fake Monica : I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women...
UNK: ...and you're worried about who'll take you to the circus?
Monica : Well, not worried, you know, just wondering.
UNK: Fake Monica : There's nothing to wonder about.
UNK: You'll go back to being who you were. That's who you are.
Monica : -Not necessarily. -Yes, necessarily.
UNK: I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the Amish thing.
Monica : -I'm not actually Amish. -Really? Then why are you like that?
Teacher : -You, by the door, in or out? -ln.
Teacher : -You're getting it all wrong. -But at least I'm doing it.
