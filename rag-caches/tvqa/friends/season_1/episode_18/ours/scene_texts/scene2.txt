UNK: -The game, Rachel. You owe us money. -Right.
Joey : It's their first time. Let's forget about the money.
Monica : Hell, no. We'll pay!
Phoebe : Monica, I had another answer all ready.
Monica : And you know what? We want a rematch.
Ross : That's fine with me. Could use some money.
UNK: -You're enjoying this, aren't you? -Well, yeah, I am.
UNK: So you get your ya-yas by taking money from your friends.
UNK: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.
Chandler : You have to put them together yourself, but they cost less.
UNK: Look, this is poker. I play to win.
Ross : For me to win, others have to lose.
Ross : If you're gonna play, don't expect me to be nice.
UNK: Because once those cards are dealt....
UNK: Yeah?
Ross : I'm not a nice guy.
UNK: All right, let's eat.
Chandler : Did you get that from the "I Love Rachel Pizzeria"?
Ross : -You still on that? -What was with that Black Bart speech?
UNK: "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy."
Ross : You're way off.

Phoebe : I just
Ross : Marcel! Where are you going with that disk?
Ross : You are not putting that on again.
Ross : If you press that button, you are in very big trouble.
Rachel : You believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Monica : -Yeah, I know. -He can get really competitive.
UNK: What?
UNK: "Hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black!"
UNK: Please!
UNK: I'm not as bad as Ross.
Rachel : I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
UNK: That wasn't an incident.
UNK: I was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand.
UNK: -I got an interview! -You're kidding! Where?
UNK: Saks Fifth Avenue.
Monica : Oh, Rachel!
Phoebe : It's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Monica : -What's the job? -Assistant buyer.
Rachel : I would be shopping!
Rachel : For a living!
UNK: That's Aunt lris. She's been playing poker since she was 5.
UNK: You've got to listen to every word she says.
UNK: -ls Tony Randall dead? -I don't think so.
UNK: -He may be now. I hit him with my car. -My God, really?
UNK: No, that's bluffing. Lesson number one.
UNK: Let me tell you something. Everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap!
UNK: -Nice earrings. -Thank you.
UNK: Aunt Iris : -Girls, sit down. -Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.
UNK: Listen, I'm parked at a meter. Let's do it. Okay?
UNK: We'll start with five-card draw.
UNK: Then we'll go into the studs and the hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.
UNK: Don't touch the cards when somebody is dealing.
UNK: How is Nathan?
UNK: Now he thinks he's a man in a woman's body.
UNK: Don't you mean a woman in a man's body?
UNK: It should be so simple.
UNK: Ross, could we please listen to anything else?
UNK: All right.
Ross : I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
UNK: Hi. Guys, guess what?
Chandler : The fifth dentist caved, and now they're all recommending Trident?
UNK: No, the interview!
UNK: Unbelievable! She absolutely loved me.
UNK: We talked for over two hours. We've the same taste in clothes.
UNK: And I went to camp with her cousin.
Rachel : -The job is perfect! I can do this. -That's great!
UNK: -Then she told a funny story. -Great, tell us and we'll laugh.
Monica : Let's play poker!
UNK: Listen, we talked about it and if you don't wanna play, it's okay.
UNK: Yes, we can play some other game. Like Pictionary?
