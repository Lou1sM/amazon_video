Monica : Very funny.
UNK: -But we'd like to try poker again. -Yes, I think we should.
Ross : -Do you want me to shuffle those? -That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.
UNK: So Pheebs owes $7. 50. Monica owes $10.00.
UNK: And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!
UNK: Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed Mary. We gotta play that other way.
UNK: All right, here's my $7.50. But this money is cursed.
UNK: -What? -I cursed it!
Phoebe : Now bad things will happen to the spender.
Chandler : I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway.
UNK: This way, I can split them up with a movie.
UNK: So that just leaves the big Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.
UNK: Could you be any smugger?
UNK: Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up a new art gallery...
UNK: ...and I could sure use the portraits of Lincoln and Hamilton.
UNK: It's so typical. "I'm a man! I have a penis!
Rachel : I have to win money to exert my power over women!"
UNK: This isn't over.
Monica : We'll play you again. We'll win. You'll lose.
UNK: You'll beg. We'll laugh.
Monica : We'll take every last dime you have. And you'll hate yourselves forever!
UNK: Kind of stepped on my point there, Mon.
UNK: I can't believe you lost! How much did they take?
UNK: Like 30 bucks.
UNK: -I'll give you that money back. -Really?
UNK: No, I'm bluffing! You guys haven't learned crap!
UNK: -Hand me the cards! -Can l?
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Wanna give us your money now? We can skip the formality of really playing.
UNK: No, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh, monkey boy.
UNK: Done with chitchat? Ready for serious poker?
Phoebe : You guys, look! The one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go.
UNK: Right. Serious poker.
UNK: -Mon, got any more of those salmon? -You want to eat or play poker?
Ross : -Where are you going? -To the bathroom.
Monica : Want to go to the bathroom or play poker?
Monica : Go to the bathroom.
Joey : -Well, I'm gonna order a pizza. -No!
UNK: I'm waiting to hear from that job. The store closes at 9 : 00. Eat then.
UNK: That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac to hold me over.
UNK: All right. Cincinnati. No blinds. Everybody, ante.
UNK: Yes!
Phoebe : Or no.
UNK: -All right! Your money's mine, Greene. -Your fly's open, Geller.
Phoebe : You know what I just realized? Joker is poker with a "J"!
UNK: Coincidence?
UNK: That's jo-incidence with a "C"!
UNK: -Phoebe? -Yeah, I'm out.
Rachel : -I'm in. -Me too.
Monica : Me too. What do you got?
UNK: You better hop out of the shower, because I got a flush.
UNK: Well, well, well!
UNK: Hop back in, bucko, because I got four sixes!
UNK: I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh, my God!
Joey : You know what? I'll make a little Ross pile.
UNK: Look!
UNK: I think that one was Ross'. And I think that one was Ross'.
UNK: Well, I have got your money And you'll never see it
Rachel : And your fly's still open
Rachel : I made you look
Rachel : -I'm in. -I couldn't be in-er.
Phoebe : Monica, in or out?
Monica : I hate this game!
Phoebe : Joey, your bet.
UNK: I fold like a hooker who got hit in the stomach...
Joey : ... by a fat guy with sores on his face.
Phoebe : I'm out.
UNK: -Ross? -I'm very in.
UNK: -Chandler? -Couldn't be more out.
Phoebe : Me too. Rachel?
Rachel : I will see you and I'll raise you. Do you wanna waste another buck?
Ross : No, not this time. What did you have?
Rachel : -I'm not telling. -Show them.
UNK: -No. -Show them!
Rachel : -Get your hands out of there! -I've had dates like this.
Rachel : Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you?
Rachel : Your whole face is getting red. Veins popping out of your temple!
Phoebe : Plus, that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Ross : -I'm not losing. -You're definitely losing.
UNK: Hello. Rachel Greene.
UNK: Excuse me. It's about the job!
