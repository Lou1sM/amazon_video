UNK: T rust me, it's much better that I know.
UNK: But I just liked it better before. It was better.
Phoebe : She took it pretty well. Paolo's over there now, so....
UNK: We should go and see if she's okay. Just one second.
UNK: -Score! -Game! Nice!
UNK: Come on, Pheebs.
UNK: Well, it looks like we kicked your butts.
UNK: She did. You could be on the Olympic "Standing There" team.
Ross : Come on. Two on one.
UNK: Why are you here? She just broke up with him.
Chandler : It's time for you to swoop in.
Ross : -What, now? -Yes. Now is when you swoop.
Joey : When Paolo walks out, you gotta be the first guy she sees.
UNK: She's gotta know you' re everything he's not. You' re the anti-Paolo.
