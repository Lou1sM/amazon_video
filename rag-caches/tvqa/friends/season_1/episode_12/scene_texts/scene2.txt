Chandler : Because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
Joey : -That's the rule. -What rule? There's no rule.
Chandler : -You owe me a table. -How did you get there?
UNK: It was fine until your breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecio.
Joey : You knew about that?
UNK: The impressions in the butter left little to the imagination.
Joey : How about if we split it?
UNK: -What do you mean, buy it together? -Yeah.
UNK: -Do you think we' re ready for that? -Why not?
UNK: It's a big commitment. What if one of us wants to move out?
Joey : -You' re moving out? -l' m not.
UNK: -You'd tell me if you were, right? -Yes.
UNK: -It's just, with my last roommate -I know all about Kip.
UNK: We bought a hibachi, then he ran off and got married. Things got ugly.
Joey : Let me ask you something. Was Kip a better roommate than me?
UNK: Oh, don't do that.
