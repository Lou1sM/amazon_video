Phoebe : ... he's gorgeous.
Phoebe : And he's charming.
Phoebe : -And when he looks -Okay, Pheebs.
Phoebe : The end.
UNK: God.
Phoebe : Should I not have told you?
UNK: T rust me, it's much better that I know.
UNK: But I just liked it better before. It was better.
Phoebe : She took it pretty well. Paolo's over there now, so....
UNK: We should go and see if she's okay. Just one second.
UNK: -Score! -Game! Nice!
UNK: Come on, Pheebs.
UNK: Well, it looks like we kicked your butts.
UNK: She did. You could be on the Olympic "Standing There" team.
Ross : Come on. Two on one.
UNK: Why are you here? She just broke up with him.
Chandler : It's time for you to swoop in.
Ross : -What, now? -Yes. Now is when you swoop.
Joey : When Paolo walks out, you gotta be the first guy she sees.
UNK: She's gotta know you' re everything he's not. You' re the anti-Paolo.
Chandler : My Catholic friend is right.
Chandler : She's distraught. You' re there for her.
Chandler : You pick up the pieces and then you usher in "The Age of Ross. "
UNK: -See this? See? -Hold it! Ascolta!
Ross : -How's it going? -Don't stare.
UNK: She threw his clothes off the balcony. Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.
UNK: That is, " How could you? " or " Enormous breasts! "
Monica : Here he comes.
Monica : I am...
Paolo : ...to say goodbye.
UNK: Okay, bye-bye.
Monica : Paolo, I really hate you for what you did, but I still have five of these...
Monica : ...so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
UNK: I just wanna tell you, and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say....
Phoebe : Oh, just look at her.
UNK: Guys, I think only one of us should go...
Ross : -...so she's not overwhelmed. -Right.
Ross : And I really think it should be me.
Ross : You all right?
Rachel : I've been better.
UNK: I don't believe this.
UNK: I wasn't supposed to care about this guy.
UNK: It was just supposed to be this big, fun, ltalian thing.
UNK: Someday I could look back and say, "That was a big, fun, ltalian thing. "
UNK: It wasn't supposed to feel like this when it was over.
Ross : Come here.
UNK: Listen...
Ross : ...you deserve so much better than him.
Ross : I mean, you...
Ross : ...should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
UNK: What?
Rachel : I' m so sick of guys!
Rachel : I don't want to look at or think about another guy.
Rachel : I don't even want to be near another guy.
Rachel : Ross, you' re so great.
Monica : -Are you all right? -Are you okay?
UNK: -Medium. Any cookies left? -Yeah.
Ross : See, Rach...
UNK: ... I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer.
Ross : What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Rachel : I just need to be by myself for a while.
UNK: -I just gotta figure out what I want. -No, no.
UNK: See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.
Rachel : No, I know. I know.
UNK: And l' m sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.
UNK: -What? -What?
UNK: I' m having a boy?
UNK: No.
Rachel : No. In fact, you' re not having a boy.
UNK: I' m having a boy.
Ross : -Huh? Am I having a boy? -You' re having a boy!
UNK: I' m having a boy!
UNK: -l' m having a boy! -What is it?
UNK: I' m having a boy! I' m having a boy!
UNK: Joey And Chandler : We already knew that!
UNK: I' m having a son.
Monica : Yes! And that would be a shutdown!
UNK: Shutout!
UNK: Where you going? One more game!
UNK: -It's 2 : 30 in the morning. -Yeah, get out!
UNK: You guys always hang out in my apartment.
Monica : I'll only use my left hand.
Monica : Come on, wussies!
UNK: All right! Okay! I gotta go!
UNK: I' m going.
UNK: And l' m gone.
Monica : -One more game? -Oh, yeah.
