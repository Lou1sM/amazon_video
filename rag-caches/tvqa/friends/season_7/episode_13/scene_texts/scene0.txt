Joey : - Hey. - Hi.
Joey : - What are you doing? - I was thinking of moving the couch.
Joey : Why would you want to do that?
UNK: So there'd be a decent place for me to sit?
Joey : - Rach, there is a decent place. - And your lap does not count.
Rachel : - Come on, help me move this. - No, no, no.
UNK: [scene : - No? - No.
Joey : Rosita does not move.
UNK: I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?
UNK: As in "Rosita does not move."
UNK: It's just a chair. What's the big deal?
UNK: It's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...
UNK: ...and it's at an angle where you don't get any glare coming off Stevie.
Rachel : Stevie the TV?
Joey : - Is there a problem? - No.
Rachel : What does he know?
Rachel : Come on, Rosita. Us chicas gotta stick together.
Rachel : You bitch!
UNK: The One Where Rosita Dies
Ross : Not "my friend, Ross," "brother-in-law, Ross."
UNK: That's weird, isn't it?
UNK: Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross"?
Ross : Sure, do whatever you want.
Monica : Hey, Ross?
UNK: I checked the real estate section.
Monica : Look at this.
UNK: Looks like Mom and Dad's house.
Ross : Even has a tree with a broken limb out front.
UNK: And the window in the attic...
Ross : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : What happened to the window in the attic?
UNK: - I can't believe they're selling it. - And they didn't tell us.
Phoebe : What happened to the window in the attic?
Ross : Hello, Dad? Monica and I just saw the house in the paper.
UNK: Yes, we're surprised.
Ross : Who did you leave a message with?
UNK: Sorry!
UNK: Joey, Joey, I'm so sorry.
Joey : I told you not to move it! How would you feel if, say...
UNK: ...I wanted to move your mom, okay...
UNK: ...and you said, "Don't," and I did it anyway...
Joey : ...and her head fell off?
UNK: I'll buy you a new one, okay?
UNK: We'll go to the store and get you a new chair right now.
UNK: She's not even cold yet.
UNK: Wouldn't Rosita have wanted you to move on?
UNK: I mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first.
UNK: That's true.
Rachel : - Okay, you ready? - Yeah.
