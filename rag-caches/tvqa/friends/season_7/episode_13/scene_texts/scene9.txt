UNK: I don't know any Earl.
UNK: I'm right here!
UNK: Earl?
UNK: I'm Phoebe.
UNK: Phoebe?
Earl : The lady who sells toner?
UNK: Look, you can't kill yourself.
Earl : Look, I really appreciate you coming down...
UNK: No, I can't let you do it.
Joey : - Why? - Because, fate made me call you today.
Earl : I thought it was toner.
Phoebe : Think about it, okay? This isn't even my regular job.
UNK: My first day, you're my first call.
UNK: Somebody else may have hung up, but I wouldn't do that...
Phoebe : ...because I know about this stuff.
Phoebe : - My mom killed herself. - Really?
Joey : - How? - I'm not gonna give you tips.
UNK: Don't you see that this...
UNK: ...all came together so I could stop you from doing this?
UNK: - Couldn't it just be a coincidence? - No, it's fate.
UNK: It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Phoebe : Oh, well.
UNK: Okay, here's a weird thing.
Phoebe : My mother was also a supply manager.
UNK: I'm actually the office manager.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! So was she!
Phoebe : And get this, okay.
Phoebe : Your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl.
UNK: Puh-Earl.
Earl : Was there anything else?
UNK: Sure.
Phoebe : Where're you from?
Earl : - Philadelphia. - Oh, my God, so was she!
UNK: I've got goose bumps.
Monica : - Really? - I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.
Phoebe : These jerks might not care about you...
Phoebe : ...but the universe does, and that says a lot.
Earl : Did you hear that?
UNK: I don't need you guys to care about me...
Earl : ...because the universe cares!
Earl : The whole universe!
UNK: I really wish they'd care a little bit.
UNK: You know, I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place.
Monica : Hey, guys!
UNK: - Oh, no, it's you. - Yeah.
Monica : Oh, this is terrible.
Monica : Everything is destroyed.
Monica : Look at this.
UNK: It meant enough for me to save, and now I can't tell what it is.
UNK: It's still soft.
Monica : What do you think this is?
Ross : I think it was a mouse.
UNK: Mr. Geller : - How are you, honey? - How do you think I am?
UNK: You've wrecked my childhood memories...
Monica : ...you love Ross more than me.
Monica : And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross.
UNK: I'm sorry about what happened...
UNK: ...and I probably can't make it up to you...
UNK: ...but here's a start.
UNK: - What's this? - It's the key to my Porsche.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Well, the key to your Porsche.
UNK: What?
UNK: What?!
UNK: I've considered getting rid of it. I saw my reflection the other day.
UNK: Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
UNK: You're giving it to me? You're kidding.
UNK: Well, wait a minute.
Ross : A couple of stupid boxes get wet, and she gets a Porsche?
UNK: - Let's take a drive? - All right!
UNK: What about me? I'm a medical marvel!
Monica : Hey, guys.
UNK: Have you seen Chandler's chair?
UNK: Joey broke it. He got rid of it.
Monica : Are you kidding? I get a Porsche and the Barcalounger's gone?
Monica : This is the best day ever!
