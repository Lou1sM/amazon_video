Ross : - Oh, this'll make a great memory. - Okay.
Monica : Which boxes are mine?
Ross : - These are yours right here. - Okay.
Monica : A coloring book.
Ross : You loved that thing.
Ross : You never went anywhere without...
Ross : ...without that coloring book.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Looks like I had trouble staying in the lines.
UNK: Nuh-uh!
Monica : - An old glove? - Yeah, you loved that glove.
UNK: Mr. Geller : You took it every place you went. You never went anyplace without the glove.
UNK: Wow, look at this.
UNK: I can't believe I even fit into this shirt.
UNK: Oh, this is yours.
UNK: I don't know how that got in there.
UNK: This isn't mine.
UNK: Hey, this isn't my stuff.
UNK: Ross, these are your boxes.
Monica : Where are my boxes?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Your boxes are...
Joey : - What? - Dad?
UNK: Mr. Geller : The garage flooded, sweetie, and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.
Monica : Just mine?
UNK: I'm afraid so.
UNK: Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?
UNK: And if you say the words "medical marvel," I'm going to Easy-Bake your head.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
UNK: Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories...
UNK: ...so you could keep the bottom of your car from water?
UNK: Mr. Geller : There was also leaves and gook and stuff.
UNK: I can't believe this!
