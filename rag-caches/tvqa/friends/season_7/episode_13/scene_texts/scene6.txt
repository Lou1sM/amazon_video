Guy : Hey, guy.
UNK: Wait, that sounded like someone being nice to you.
UNK: No, that's just the "hey, guy" guy.
Earl : He says that to everybody. He's the worst.
UNK: I'd like to take him with me.
UNK: All right. Let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?
UNK: There's gotta be someone worth sticking around for.
UNK: What about family or friends? Maybe a girlfriend?
Earl : Yeah, right.
Phoebe : Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?
Ross : - Oh, God. - No, whatever. Anything.
Guy : Hey, guy.
UNK: Yeah, he's gotta go.
Earl : Okay, I should...
Earl : ...be getting back to my thing now.
UNK: See you.
UNK: I'm not finished! Don't you dare hang up on me!
UNK: The new girl's good.
Monica : Hey, guys.
UNK: I just whipped us up some Easy-Bake treats. They should be ready in about three days.
UNK: That's a good one! You hear that, Ross? Three days!
