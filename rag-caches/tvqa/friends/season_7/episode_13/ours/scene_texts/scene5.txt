Earl : Hey, everybody...
UNK: ...I'm gonna kill myself.
UNK: I'll get back to you.
Earl : I got nothing.
UNK: Wait.
Earl : Hey, Marge.
Earl : Nothing. Nothing.
UNK: Good chair.
Chandler : Now, if anybody asks...
Chandler : ...your name is Rosita.
Rachel : Come on, Joey. I just bought you a new chair, the most expensive one in the store.
UNK: You know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
UNK: Francette?
Joey : What is she, a couch?
Joey : Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Rachel : Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour.
UNK: Maybe we should move Rosita out of here.
Rachel : Start the healing process.
UNK: Yeah, I guess you're right.
UNK: Maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator.
UNK: It's gonna be so sad.
UNK: And kind of cool.
UNK: She's healed!
UNK: - That's weird. - No, it's not weird.
UNK: It's a miracle!
UNK: It's not a miracle. I'm sure there's an explanation.
UNK: There is. If your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen.
UNK: - I don't... - Can you tell me how this happened?
Rachel : - Well, no. - Miracle.
UNK: No, you know what, maybe somebody came in here and fixed it. Or something.
UNK: Someone like an angel?
UNK: That's right, Joey. The chair angel came in and healed your chair.
Joey : Get your non-believer ass out of my chair!
UNK: She'll understand. I didn't do it on purpose.
UNK: Dad, that won't matter to her.
Ross : Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.
UNK: And all her stuff is...
Ross : ...growing new stuff.
UNK: This is the kind of thing...
Ross : ...that makes her think you love me more than her.
UNK: My God. Does she think that?
Ross : - Can you blame her? - I don't know.
UNK: Mr. Geller : We may have favored you unconsciously. You were a marvel.
UNK: - The doctors said your mom couldn't... - I don't want to hear it.
Monica : - Really? - Well, not right now.
Ross : Monica came here for some memories. Damn it, we'll give her some.
Ross : Okay, grab...
UNK: Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff from mine...
Ross : ...and whatever we can pass off as hers, we'll put in there.
UNK: - Like, this. She could have made this. - Sure.
UNK: And this, she could have won this.
UNK: - This could have been hers. - Sure.
UNK: - Here, what about this? - Your makeup kit?
UNK: I'd feel better.
Rachel : I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself.
Joey : Yeah. Me too.
UNK: - Hey, how's the miracle chair? - Fine.
UNK: You know, this thing has speakers in the headrest?
Joey : - No, really? - Yeah.
UNK: You can hook it to the TV and you get radio.
Joey : My chair heals itself.
UNK: Earl, you're not hearing me. All I'm saying is, you're not alone, all right?
Phoebe : Everybody hates the people they work with.
