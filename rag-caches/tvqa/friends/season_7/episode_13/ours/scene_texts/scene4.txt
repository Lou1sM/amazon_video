Phoebe : Earl. Thanks.
Phoebe : Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
Phoebe : I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
UNK: I don't need any toner.
UNK: I hear what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner.
Earl : Not me.
Phoebe : May I ask why?
UNK: You want to know why?
UNK: You want to know why?
Phoebe : I surely do.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I don't need any toner...
UNK: ...because I'm gonna kill myself.
UNK: Is that because you're out of toner?
UNK: Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.
UNK: Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up. Just please talk to me.
UNK: Well...
UNK: I only had one thing to do today.
UNK: I guess I could push it back.
Phoebe : Yeah. Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
UNK: I've been working for 10 years now at this...
Earl : ...meaningless, dead-end job...
Earl : ...and nobody here even knows that I exist.
UNK: Chandler?
UNK: I'm sorry?
UNK: Look...
UNK: ...I'm sure that people know you exist.
Earl : Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...
Earl : ...surrounded by people.
UNK: I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself...
UNK: ...and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang on.
