UNK: Screw it. I'm having one.
Rachel : - Hey, Chandler. - Hey.
Rachel : How'd you like to sit in a chair that reclines...
Rachel : ...has a rolling massage...
UNK: ...and speakers in the headrest?
UNK: I've tried that so many times...
UNK: ...they won't even let me in the store anymore.
UNK: What if I said you could do it in my apartment?
Chandler : Are you telling me...
Chandler : ...you bought the chair that makes all others obsolete?
Chandler : The chair that Sit Magazine called "Chair of the Year"?
Rachel : I just purchased...
Rachel : ...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.
UNK: Well, that's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?
UNK: It's a long story, but, I broke Joey's chair...
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke Joey's chair?
UNK: I thought I did, that's why I replaced it with mine.
UNK: That's how it got fixed!
UNK: You thought that elves came in and fixed it?
UNK: No.
UNK: Angels.
UNK: I'm getting my chair back.
UNK: Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all!
UNK: I guess this chair's mine now.
Chandler : Joey, you broke my chair!
Rachel : Your chair?
UNK: He thought he broke it, so he switched chairs.
Joey : So there was no miracle?
Rachel : No, Joe. No miracle.
Joey : Oh, no! This is devastating!
UNK: My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have a new chair to get me through this.
UNK: Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore.
Rachel : That is my chair now. You can sit on my lap.
Rachel : No, I take that back!
Chandler : I think I should get the chair.
Joey : - How do you figure? - You broke a chair and you broke a chair.
UNK: The only one here that hasn't broken a chair is me.
UNK: No, no, no. This chair's not going anywhere.
UNK: - Where's the logic in that? - The logic...
Rachel : ...is that there are two of us...
Rachel : ...and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half.
Chandler : So Joey breaks my chair, and I get nothing?
UNK: That's right.
Chandler : What are you guys, like, a gang or something?
Joey : Yeah, we are.
UNK: We're the Cobras.
UNK: Where can I find Earl? He's the supply manager here.
