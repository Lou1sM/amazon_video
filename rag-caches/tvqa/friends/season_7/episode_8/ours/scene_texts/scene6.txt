Chandler : Why not?
Ross : Monica's crying.
Ross : She's very upset about this whole Klunkers thing.
UNK: - Well, I should go in there. - No, no.
Ross : No, she doesn't want to see you right now.
Chandler : - Why not? - Because you sent away the dog.
UNK: - That's ridiculous. - Oh, is it? Is it?!
Ross : Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover.
Ross : And one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs.
UNK: So Monica and her friend Phyllis...
Ross : ...take away the dog, and that was the last time we ever saw him. See?
Ross : This is just like that...
Ross : ...only with a few details changed.
UNK: Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.
Joey : Bring on the food.
Joey : - What's the matter? - Monica's upset because of Klunkers.
Joey : So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.
UNK: Yeah, I could be a hero. I could do that.
Chandler : What if it attacks me?
Joey : Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Chandler : And that doesn't scare you?
Joey : Ross, you need some help?
Ross : From you?
Ross : Yes, please.
Joey : First of all, Utah?
Joey : Dude, you can't just make stuff up.
UNK: Okay, Klunkers, come here, you big gerbil.
UNK: Klunkers.
UNK: Where's my Klunkers, my little...?
Chandler : No, no, no. I am not going to do that voice.
UNK: Klunkers.
UNK: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
UNK: Come back here, you furry, little butt-sniffer.
UNK: Not you, ma'am.
Ross : I hate America!
Ross : When I finish this game, I swear, I am moving.
UNK: - Tag still talking to the police? - Yeah.
UNK: Damn it. Why did I open my mouth?
UNK: "I have a crush on you. I'm attracted to you."
Rachel : I know that I freaked him out.
UNK: If you said it like that, you did.
UNK: What was I thinking?
UNK: I work with this man. I have to see him every day.
UNK: How'd this happen to me?
UNK: Oh, wait. That's right, it was because of you.
UNK: All right, I think I can help you. You wanna know what you have to do?
UNK: - Please, help me. - Okay, okay, okay.
UNK: Now, you're gonna want to talk to him about this, right?
UNK: But trust me, Rach, that'll only make it worse.
UNK: You have to deny everything.
UNK: That conversation out there, never happened.
UNK: Joey, I don't think that's gonna work. It was a pretty long conversation.
UNK: There was no conversation.
UNK: Okay. Joey, I'm just gonna talk to Tag.
UNK: Who's "Tag"? There's no "Tag".
UNK: Okay. This conversation is over.
UNK: See? It works.
Phoebe : Hey, is Chandler here?
Chandler : No, he went for a walk.
UNK: Okay, you cannot tell him, but look who's back.
UNK: Well, no, no, no.
Joey : He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here.
Phoebe : Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there!
