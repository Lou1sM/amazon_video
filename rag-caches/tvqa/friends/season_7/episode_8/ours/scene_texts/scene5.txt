Monica : I can't leave her.
UNK: We could sneak the dog back in, and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Monica : That's not gonna work.
UNK: I had that dog for three days, and Chandler had no idea.
Phoebe : He's not so smart.
Monica : Hey. I didn't know either.
UNK: Yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Monica : Yeah, I knew.
Phoebe : Where's Chandler?
Chandler : - Here I am. - Wash your hands.
UNK: How did you know?
Ross : Hey, what's she doing back here?
Monica : Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream.
Ross : Hey, look, Phoebe. I laid out the states geographically.
UNK: We don't have time for this. We have to keep him away from my room.
UNK: - Yeah, but, look what... - This is what we do not have time for!
Chandler : - Where's Monica? - In Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
