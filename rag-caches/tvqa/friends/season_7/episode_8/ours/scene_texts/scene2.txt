UNK: Ross' apartment is nice. How come we don't hang out here?
UNK: Maybe because it smells a weird.
Chandler : It's like old pumpkins or something.
Monica : - That's my pie. - Which smells delicious.
Monica : - Uh-oh. Uh-oh. - What?
Monica : We left Joey alone with the food.
Monica : Yep, yep, I knew it.
Monica : There he is...
Monica : ...feeding stuffing to a dog!
Phoebe : Hi, Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
UNK: Why is a dog in our apartment?
Phoebe : I'm sorry, who's this?
Monica : There's a dog sitting on my couch.
Chandler : Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Phoebe : - There's no dog here. - Yes, there is!
Monica : He's black and white and shaggy.
Monica : He's sitting next to Rachel and licking her hand.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! Where are you?
Monica : I'll be right there.
Phoebe : They're here already? How are they doing this?!
