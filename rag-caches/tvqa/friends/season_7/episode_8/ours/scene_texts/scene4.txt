Ross : How can I not get this?
Ross : I'm a college professor. I got 1450 on my SATs.
UNK: Twelve-fifty.
Ross : Damn, I forgot you were here.
UNK: We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.
Phoebe : We'll be back in a minute.
UNK: Before you go, can I ask you a question?
Rachel : When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend...
Rachel : ...what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Phoebe : I'd say about a month.
UNK: Really? I'd say three to four.
UNK: Half-hour.
UNK: Interesting.
Monica : When it's your assistant, I'd say never.
Joey : All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you?
Joey : Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.
UNK: A "moo" point?
Joey : Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.
Joey : It just doesn't matter.
UNK: It's "moo."
Rachel : Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Monica : Don't listen to Joey.
Monica : Okay, would you look at him?
UNK: He's obviously depressed. He's away from his family.
Monica : What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Rachel : You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.
UNK: - Okay, that's what I'm going to do. - Fine, take their advice.
Joey : No one ever listens to me.
Joey : When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
UNK: Okay, I'm keeping my end of the deal.
UNK: Why is the dog still here?
UNK: - We're leaving. - Okay.
UNK: - Come on. - Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
UNK: I could pull this off, right?
Ross : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: How you holding up?
Chandler : Not bad.
Rachel : - I'm sorry about your girlfriend. - Thanks.
Rachel : - Were you guys together a long time? - A year, on and off.
UNK: I kind of thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Rachel : - Now that she broke up with you. - Yeah.
Tag : It's weird.
UNK: I used to assume that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy.
UNK: That all that was just a given. Lately, it's like, what if it's not?
Tag : Do you ever have that feeling?
UNK: No.
UNK: Yeah.
Rachel : All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.
UNK: But, you know, then I figure, it has to work out.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Because it has to.
UNK: - You really have all the answers, don't you? - No, no, I do. I really do.
Tag : - Thanks for talking to me. - Come on, what are bosses for?
Rachel : Hug it out.
Joey : All right, he likes you back.
UNK: Told you, you should go for it.
UNK: What?
UNK: Street noise drown any of that out?
UNK: No? See you later.
UNK: Okay.
Tag : What did Joey say? I like you back?
UNK: You know... Well, see... He...
UNK: Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.
UNK: And you were hugging me...
Rachel : ...so, obviously, you are not repulsed by it. Yeah!
UNK: - Wait, that doesn't make any sense. - No?
Rachel : All right, here's the truth.
Rachel : Joey said what he said...
Rachel : ...because I'm attracted to you.
UNK: Wow.
Rachel : Yeah, I admit it.
UNK: I have a crush on you. I know that's crazy because we work together...
Rachel : ...and nothing could ever happen.
UNK: The last thing I wanted to do was freak you out...
Rachel : ...or make you feel uncomfortable.
Rachel : Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Phoebe : Oh, my God. Those guys are stealing my car.
UNK: What?
Tag : Right there. That's my car!
Ross : - Hey! - Okay, that's gonna take one minute.
Rachel : Do you have anything else you want to get off your chest?
Tag : I can't believe this.
Rachel : We still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.
Rachel : Look, there they go.
Monica : Okay, Phoebe. We should probably go back now.
Phoebe : Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.
Monica : Stop it. Stop.
Monica : - Okay, let's go. We can be strong. - Yeah, okay.
Monica : Did you hear that? She said, "Monica."
