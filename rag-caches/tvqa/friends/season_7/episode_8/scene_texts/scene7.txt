Monica : You think?
Monica : Hi, honey.
Chandler : Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
UNK: - What? Why would...? - Wait and see.
Phoebe : Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Chandler : Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Klunkers for you...
UNK: ...and I left the door open, and she must've gotten out.
Chandler : And I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof.
Chandler : Which, FYI, Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed.
Chandler : I couldn't find him...
Chandler : ...and I am so, so, so sorry.
UNK: But I do know where we can all go ease the pain.
Phoebe : We have good news. Look who's back!
UNK: Klunkers. Oh, my God!
Monica : - She came back all by herself. - It's a Thanksgiving miracle.
Chandler : It is so good to see you.
Phoebe : She came all the way back from Ross' building.
UNK: The things she must've seen.
Phoebe : She climbed up the fire escape...
Phoebe : ...and she tapped on the window with her teeny, little paw, and we ran to let her in.
Phoebe : I went too far, didn't I?
Phoebe : When should I have stopped?
Ross : Okay, maybe this is so hard because there aren't 50 states.
Ross : Let me tell you something. I have 49 states...
Ross : ...and there are no more!
Ross : I think I should be able to eat something.
Chandler : It's up to you.
Rachel : - Oh, hi. How are you doing? - I'm okay.
Tag : I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Tag : Thanks for having me over.
UNK: Tag, you're going?
UNK: We didn't even get a chance to talk.
Ross : So where did you say you're from again?
Tag : - Colorado. - What good are you?
Rachel : Look, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I never should've said what I said.
Rachel : It just doesn't matter how I feel.
Rachel : We work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us.
UNK: I would love to go to work on Monday and never talk about this again.
Rachel : Okay. Big day, Monday. Lots to do.
UNK: So we okay?
Tag : I'm not.
Monica : I knew it. I freaked you out.
Tag : No, you didn't.
UNK: What freaked me out was you saying nothing could happen between us.
Chandler : - Really? - Yeah.
Tag : So please don't fire me for doing this.
Rachel : That's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
UNK: Delaware.
UNK: Delaware.
Rachel : - All right. - I want my turkey now.
Chandler : You got it.
Chandler : You got Nevada twice.
Rachel : - I know. - Yeah.
