Rachel : Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?
Tag : I wanted to see if your offer was still good.
Rachel : Well, sure. Come in.
UNK: Well, what happened to your girlfriend?
UNK: We kind of broke up this morning.
Rachel : - Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ross : Ohio, thank you.
UNK: Where's the dog?
UNK: What dog? There's no dog here.
Joey : Yeah, that dog left.
UNK: Wait a minute. I thought we agreed to say... Your thing. Yeah.
Monica : Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.
Phoebe : There's no dog in here.
UNK: Well, the hiding-the-dog plan is off to a great start.
Chandler : Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.
Phoebe : No, that's just me coughing.
Phoebe : Oh, good. There you are.
Phoebe : Listen, I have a dog in my room.
Chandler : What is it doing here?
UNK: I'm watching it for friends who went out of town.
UNK: Wait.
UNK: Hello, my name is Klunkers.
Phoebe : May I please stay with you nice people?
UNK: I wish he could stay here, but Chandler's allergic.
Chandler : Extremely allergic, okay?
Chandler : If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes...
Chandler : ...my throat will just close up.
UNK: That's odd. This dog's been living here for the past three days.
UNK: Really?
UNK: If he's been here that long...
Monica : ...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to it.
Chandler : It still has to go, right?
UNK: Why?
Chandler : - Okay, it's... - Don't do it!
Monica : - Don't do what? - I have to.
Chandler : Okay? It's time.
Chandler : Okay, I hate dogs.
Ross : - What?! - That's crazy? Why?
Joey : Told you.
Chandler : They are needy...
Chandler : ...jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking...
Chandler : ...and that scares me a little bit.
UNK: You're right. They are scary.
Ross : She just ate a treat out of my hand!
UNK: So you're not allergic? I mean, does that mean you're not allergic to wool either?
UNK: You bought me a pink turtleneck sweater.
UNK: The guy in the catalog pulled it off.
UNK: Wait. Do you not like all dogs?
Rachel : I mean, not even puppies?
Chandler : Is there a puppy here?
Tag : - You don't like puppies? - Okay, you are new.
Joey : Look, Chandler, I told you. Never tell anyone about this dog thing.
UNK: It's like Ross not liking ice cream.
Phoebe : - You don't like ice cream? - It's too cold!
Chandler : It's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Ross : Hurts my teeth.
UNK: And I don't want you guys to hate me...
Chandler : ...but I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay?
Chandler : So either the dog goes or I go.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
