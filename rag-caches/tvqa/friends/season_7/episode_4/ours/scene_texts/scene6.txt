UNK: He's Tag. This is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?
UNK: Phoebe.
UNK: - That's a great name. - Oh, you like that?
Phoebe : - You should hear my phone number. - Okay. We'll be right back.
Phoebe : So you hired yourself a little treat, did you?
Rachel : I know how it looks, but I am telling you...
UNK: You can't get involved with your assistant.
UNK: I know that, and I know hiring him was not the smartest thing I've ever done.
UNK: But from now on, I swear this is strictly professional.
Rachel : - Yes. - Hey, Rachel.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Cute assistant. What's his story?
Kathy : - Is he... - Gay? Yeah.
Joey : Hey, Terry.
Terry : Joey Tribbiani.
Terry : Surprised your big head could fit through our small halls.
Terry : - I gotta go, Joey. - Wait, Terry! Look.
UNK: I'm really sorry about before.
UNK: I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big to audition for you.
Joey : - Give me another chance. - I can't.
Joey : Wait, Terry, please!
Joey : Look, I just lost my other job, okay?
Joey : You have no idea how much I need this.
Joey : Please, help me out.
Joey : For old times' sake.
UNK: This guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
UNK: It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miracle worker.
UNK: Nurse #2 : Here he comes.
UNK: Dr. Stryker Ramoray : Good morning.
UNK: Drake, it's your brother, Stryker. Can you hear me?
UNK: And cut.
UNK: I'm back, baby!
UNK: You know, in my defense...
Monica : ...there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Ross : And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me.
UNK: - Do you have trouble telling time now? - No.
Chandler : - Quick, what time is it? - Time to kiss a guy?
Monica : What are you laughing at, Pampers?
UNK: You know when I said married people...
Chandler : ...should share everything and not have any secrets?
Phoebe : - Yeah. - Yeah, that was stupid. Let's not do that.
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: - I'm on board. - Thank you. Thank you.
UNK: We should keep the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else.
Monica : Yeah, definitely.
UNK: Okay. If you'll excuse me...
UNK: ...I'm gonna hang out with people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
UNK: - Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe. - Man!
UNK: Not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with the guys at my office.
UNK: Hi.
Tag : - Do you have a minute? - Sure. What's up?
Tag : I got asked out twice today while I was at lunch...
Tag : ...by guys.
Joey : - Really? - Yeah.
Tag : Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Rachel : Oh, did you not want people to know that?
UNK: I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
UNK: Why is that?
UNK: - I don't think I should say. - Oh, you can say.
UNK: Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Rachel : - Okay. - Okay.
Mac : - Well... - Yeah.
UNK: I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
UNK: Yeah, she's gay.
