UNK: And you're right. He's not the type...
UNK: ...to go to bars and make out with girls.
Monica : You kissed a guy?
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Chandler : In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Ross : Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard...
Chandler : So hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Ross : Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.
UNK: Joey, do you think your favorite animal says a lot about you?
UNK: No, because goats can't talk.
UNK: [scene : - Hi. - Hey.
UNK: How's Hilda working out?
UNK: Oh, my new assistant is working out. Yes.
UNK: She happy she got the job?
Rachel : My new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?
UNK: It's the producers at Mac and Cheese, if you'll excuse me for a minute.
Joey : Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script.
UNK: Canceled!
UNK: Like they're taking it off the air?
UNK: All right. I'll see you Monday.
UNK: We're not even shooting them anymore?
Joey : All right. Bye.
Joey : They canceled Mac and Cheese!
Joey : - Sorry. - Sorry, Joey.
Joey : Why would they do that? It was a good show, right?
UNK: You want to tell secrets? Okay. In college...
Chandler : ...Ross used to wear leg warmers.
Ross : All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-alike contest and won.
Chandler : Ross came in fourth and cried!
UNK: - I welled up. - Oh, my God!
Ross : Oh, is that funny? You find that funny?
Ross : Maybe Chandler should know your secrets too.
Monica : I already told him everything. You shush!
UNK: Once she was sent to bed without dinner...
Ross : ...so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
UNK: Ross stayed home every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls.
UNK: Monica couldn't tell time until she was 13.
UNK: It's hard for some people!
Rachel : Of course it is.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: - Chandler wore my underwear to work once! - Hey!
UNK: I'm sorry, I couldn't think of any more for Ross.
Ross : In college, Chandler got drunk...
Ross : ...and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm.
Chandler : That was you.
Ross : Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.
UNK: I can't believe this!
UNK: Mac and Cheese was a great show.
UNK: How about that scene where Mac teaches Cheese how to yodel? Come on!
UNK: Yeah, I actually liked that part.
Joey : How could this happen to me?
Joey : Yesterday I had two TV shows. Today I got nothing.
Rachel : Wait a minute, what happened to Days of our Lives?
Joey : Well, they might be a little mad at me over there.
Rachel : What happened?
Joey : Well, maybe I got a little upset, and maybe I told them where they could go.
Rachel : Joey, why would you do that?
Joey : Because! They wanted me to audition.
UNK: You? An actor? That's madness!
UNK: Rachel Green's office.
UNK: Tag.
Rachel : Hi, who was that?
Tag : Nobody. I was just practicing.
UNK: Really?
UNK: [scene : - Hi. - Hi, Rachel Green's office.
Phoebe : You must be Hilda.
