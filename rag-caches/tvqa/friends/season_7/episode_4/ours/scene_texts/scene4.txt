Rachel : Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?
UNK: I came to thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday.
UNK: I noticed there aren't any plants, so I brought you your first...
Tag : There is a plant in your office.
UNK: Kind of.
UNK: - And that was there yesterday, wasn't it? - Yeah.
UNK: I got it the same time I got that one.
UNK: Right.
Rachel : - Thank you. - Anyway...
UNK: ...I'm guessing you hired somebody.
UNK: Well...
UNK: Gotcha.
Tag : Thanks again for meeting with me.
Rachel : But I hired you.
Joey : - What? - Yeah, you got the job.
UNK: - You're my new assistant. - I am?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: - I can't believe it. - Me either.
UNK: - Rachel, thank you so much. - Oh, big hug.
Joey : - Really? - No, handshake.
UNK: Okay, let's get started.
UNK: First, I need you to go downstairs...
UNK: ...find a woman named Hilda and tell her to go home.
UNK: [scene : - Hey. - Hey, good, you're home.
Chandler : Always nicer to hear than, "Oh, crap, you again."
UNK: Hey, sweetie. I made you a surprise.
Chandler : - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, tacos.
UNK: Ever since that story I've had such a craving for them.
Chandler : Did you not understand the story?
UNK: [scene : - Hey. - Hey, what's up?
UNK: Nothing. Just figuring out what to do for dinner.
UNK: Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff? You making dinner?
UNK: No.
UNK: What's over there? Tacos?
Phoebe : No. No.
UNK: They're just... They're ground beef smileys.
Ross : Those are tacos.
Monica : Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.
UNK: Either way, I'll pass. Still can't eat those.
UNK: What's so funny?
UNK: I'm not laughing.
Chandler : You told her!
UNK: Nancy Thompson's getting fired.
UNK: Okay, okay. I had food poisoning. It's not like I chose to do it!
UNK: It's not like I said, "What would make this ride more fun?"
UNK: Right. You're right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be laughing.
Monica : I should be laying down papers for you.
Ross : - How could you? - I had to. We're getting married.
UNK: Married couples can't keep secrets.
Ross : I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
UNK: Dude!
Rachel : - What happened? - Chandler and I are in a bar...
UNK: Did you not hear me say, "Dude!"?
Ross : ...and this girl is making eyes at Chandler.
UNK: So he goes over to her and after a minute or two I see them kissing.
UNK: Now, you're thinking "He's not the type to go to bars and make out with girls."
