Mac : Cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
UNK: C.h.e.e.s.e : You can say that again, Mac.
UNK: I couldn't have done it alone. You're a genius.

Joey : What did you guys think?
UNK: - Hey, the phone. - I got it. I got it.
UNK: Hold on. It's your mom.
UNK: - It's Mommy. - That's nice.
UNK: Ma. So, what did you think?
UNK: Well...
UNK: ...that was okay.
UNK: It wasn't the best.
Chandler : That was one of the worst things ever...
Chandler : ...and not just on TV.
UNK: - What should we say? - The lighting was okay.
Rachel : You got lighting last time. Lighting is mine.
Monica : I have costumes.
UNK: That means I'm stuck with :
Ross : "So we were watching you in there and you were sitting right here."
UNK: - What about you? - I don't know.

UNK: I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Chandler : - And say nothing? - Yeah, that's right.
Joey : My folks really liked it.
Joey : What did you guys think?
UNK: It wasn't that good.
UNK: You'll never believe what happened to me today.

UNK: Guess what my agent just said?
UNK: I'm in the middle of a story here.
Joey : Sorry, you finish.

UNK: That's great.
UNK: [scene : - Joey. - You weren't finished?
UNK: Yeah, "Guess who walks into my office" is my story.
Rachel : Ralph Lauren walked into my office.
UNK: If you're starting another story, at least let me finish mine.
UNK: It's the same story.

UNK: I just have one last question for you :
Rachel : How did I do? Was this okay?
Joey : - What? - I've never interviewed anyone.
UNK: I've never had anyone work for me.
UNK: When I was a kid we had a maid, but this isn't the same.
UNK: No, dear, it's not.
