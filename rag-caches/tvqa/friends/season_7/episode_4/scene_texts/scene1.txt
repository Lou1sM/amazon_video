Rachel : And I know that.
Rachel : Well, thank you so much for coming in.
Rachel : - Nice to meet you. - Good meeting you.
Rachel : All right.
UNK: I'm a total pro.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: Hi, yes, I'm sorry. The models are down the hall.
UNK: I'm here about the assistant job.
UNK: Really?
Rachel : Okay, well, then, all right. Well, just have a seat there.
UNK: So, what's your name?
Man : Tag Jones.
Rachel : Go on.
UNK: That's it. That's my whole name.
UNK: That's your whole name. Of course it is.
UNK: Okay, let's just have a look-see here.
UNK: I haven't worked in an office before. I don't have much experience...
Rachel : What are you talking about? You got three years painting houses...
Rachel : ...two whole summers at TGI Friday's.
UNK: It's lame, I know.
UNK: But I'm a goal-oriented person, eager to learn...
UNK: Just hold on a second, please.
UNK: It's for human resources. Everybody has to. Would you stand up?
UNK: No, no, no.
UNK: Hey.
Phoebe : - Anyway, I should go. - Okay. Bye.
Monica : - Hey, sweetie. - Hi, sweetie.
Chandler : What was with all the whispering?
UNK: I can't tell you. It's a secret.
UNK: Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets.
UNK: We love and respect one another too much.
Monica : But still, no.
Chandler : We should tell each other everything. I don't have secrets from you.
UNK: Really? So tell me what happened to Ross junior year at Disneyland.
UNK: No, I can't do that.
UNK: I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Rachel : - Okay. - Okay.
Chandler : So Ross and I are going to Disneyland.
Chandler : We stop at this restaurant for tacos.
UNK: When I say "restaurant," I mean a guy, a hibachi and the trunk of his car.
Chandler : So Ross has about 10 tacos.
UNK: Anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Monica : Oh, my God. He threw up?
UNK: No, he visited a town a little south of throw up.
Chandler : - No. - Yeah.
UNK: Some of the employees decided to rename the park...
UNK: ...the "Crappiest Place on Earth."
UNK: What was Phoebe's secret?
UNK: Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's old massage place, is getting fired.
UNK: That's it? I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
UNK: That's right. You lose, sucker!
Monica : Please still marry me.
Rachel : You have an assistant, right?
Chandler : Did she call?
Chandler : You told her I was sick, right? Always tell her I am sick.
UNK: No, I just don't know, how do you decide who to hire?
UNK: I have it down to two people.
UNK: One has great references and a lot of experience.
UNK: - And then there's this guy... - What about him?
Rachel : I love him.
UNK: He's so pretty I want to cry.
UNK: I don't know what to do.
Phoebe : Come on, you know what to do. You hire the first one.
UNK: Don't hire assistants because they're cute. Do it because they're qualified.
UNK: I hear you. You make a lot of sense. Can I just say one more thing?
Rachel : Look how pretty.
