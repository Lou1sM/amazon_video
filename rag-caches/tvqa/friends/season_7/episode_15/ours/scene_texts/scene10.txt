Chandler : - Oh, my God. - What?
UNK: They sent me today's script. They never send me the script.
UNK: - They don't? - I'm just in a coma.
Joey : This must mean I have lines.
Cecilia : How does it happen?
Joey : You get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
UNK: A what? Jessica hates horses.
UNK: After this, she's not gonna be crazy about electricity either.
Ross : Now, remember, you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Rachel : I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Ross : - You wanna start telling secrets? - No.
Ross : Now, remember...
UNK: ...I'm still learning.
Ross : One, two, three, four!
Ross : You know the song. Sing along.
UNK: So?
Rachel : - No. - No.
UNK: Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse was brilliant, Fredrick.
Dina : And the electric fence, inspired.
Fredrick : Thank you, sweetheart.
UNK: I can't believe she's really gone.
Dina : Look around you. All of this is ours.
UNK: I don't think so.
Dina : Who are you?
UNK: What's the matter, Dina?
UNK: Don't you recognize your own...
UNK: ...mother?
UNK: Cut! That was great, everybody. Thank you.
Cecilia : That was so wonderful!
UNK: I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was.
Phoebe : - Oh, no. - Of course not, but you were good.
UNK: Thanks.
Cecilia : Good news. I got another job.
UNK: Great. Hey, all right! What is it?
Cecilia : A film in Guadalajara.
Joey : The airport?
UNK: No, that's LaGuardia.
Cecilia : - This is Mexico. - Oh, wow.
UNK: Well, how long will you be gone?
Cecilia : Eight months.
UNK: - That's a really long time. - Yeah, but you could come and visit.
Cecilia : I bet that you could own a few places down there.
UNK: Oh, you know, I should probably buy a place in the city first.
Joey : And I just got what you meant. That is...
UNK: - That's a tricky one. - It's tricky.
UNK: Joey, I really want to thank you.
Cecilia : You made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Phoebe : Good luck.
Cecilia : You too.
