UNK: They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but soon...
UNK: ...and then that's it.
UNK: I'm so sorry. If it was up to me, you would never leave the show.
Cecilia : - Yeah, thanks. - I mean it.
UNK: I can't believe they'd do this to you. And to your fans.
UNK: They're gonna be devastated. Heartbroken. They love you so much.
UNK: Oh, you're right.
Cecilia : Thank you.
UNK: What's your name again?
UNK: [scene : - Joey. - Thank you.
Cecilia : That is so sweet.
Cecilia : Excuse me.
UNK: - It wasn't my decision. - I'm having a conversation here.
Cecilia : You were saying.
UNK: Look, the only reason I came up to you before...
UNK: ...is because, well...
UNK: ...I'm really nervous about being you.
UNK: If you could help me capture the essence of the character, you know.
Joey : Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Cecilia : All right, Joey, I'll help you.
UNK: Not because I owe it to this stupid show...
Cecilia : ...but because I owe it to Jessica.
UNK: - Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. - You're so welcome.
UNK: I've been watching some tapes. How's this?
Joey : Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
UNK: Never!
Cecilia : - Is that supposed to be me? - Yeah.
UNK: But Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
Joey : I can do an English accent?
Chandler : Well, I feel like a snack.
