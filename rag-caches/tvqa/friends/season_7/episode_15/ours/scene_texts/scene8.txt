UNK: Come on, that's not fair. You haven't even heard me play.
Chandler : We have heard you play.
UNK: No, you've heard me practice.
Ross : Just give me a chance to perform for you, then decide whatever you want.
UNK: I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play either.
UNK: Let's just say when it's over...
UNK: ...I'll bet there'll be a wee bit of celebration.
Joey : The essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.
Cecilia : So when Jessica enters a room, for instance...
Cecilia : ...she owns everything...
Cecilia : ...and every person in that room.
UNK: - You try it. - Okay.
Rachel : All right!
Cecilia : No. He already knows that he owns everything in the room.
UNK: He's not finding it out for the first time.
Cecilia : - So try it again. - Okay.
UNK: He's not angry at the room either.
Cecilia : Try it again. He owns it. He owns the room.
Cecilia : It is his. He owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!
UNK: It's a little weird, but it's getting better.
UNK: I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
UNK: It's been 20 years of my life.
UNK: Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.
UNK: It'll give you a chance to shake things up. Play different characters.
UNK: You're so talented.
Cecilia : I am, I am.
UNK: But I don't know. You know...
Cecilia : ...an actor of a certain age, it's not that easy.
UNK: That's not true. Look at Angela Lansbur... Angelina Jolie.
UNK: Probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in...
UNK: ...but I just got so comfy here and...
Cecilia : I turned down some amazing work.
Joey : Like what?
UNK: Well, let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago...
Cecilia : ...the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: But, well, now... Now's a different time for me.
UNK: Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.
Joey : Let me tell you something, okay?
UNK: When I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."
UNK: But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."
UNK: You think I'm hot?
Joey : You own the room.
UNK: We should probably get the...
UNK: Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...
Cecilia : So when Jessica kisses a man...
Cecilia : ...she usually puts...
UNK: ...both her hands on the man's face.
UNK: I notice that. Is that because she's so passionate?
UNK: No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.
UNK: You want to try it?
Joey : Yeah, okay.
Cecilia : That was good. That was really good.
UNK: But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off. They should be right...
All : Hey, hey!
UNK: Who is it?
UNK: It's Tom. I'm here to pick up the phone.
Phoebe : Why do you get to answer the door?
UNK: - Why shouldn't I? - Because it's my apartment.
Rachel : Then I get to give him the cell phone.
UNK: Okay. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
UNK: Hi.
Phoebe : Wow, how long were we arguing for?
UNK: You're not the man who left the phone.
UNK: - No, that's my assistant. - Is he coming?
UNK: No.
UNK: - Could you give us one second? - Sure.
