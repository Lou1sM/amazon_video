Rachel : His new girlfriend.
Monica : What is that?
UNK: I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.
UNK: Sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Chandler : - Oh, my God. - What?
UNK: The thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?
UNK: He was hanging out with me and said, "You're half Scottish, right?"
Rachel : - No. - Yes!
Monica : No. There is no way. It cannot be Ross.
UNK: Unbelievable. Why is your family Scottish?
Chandler : Why is your family Ross?
Monica : He cannot play at our wedding. Everyone will leave.
UNK: It'll be like when he rapped at my bat mitzvah.
UNK: We can't just tell him no. He's probably been practicing forever. He'll be crushed.
UNK: Maybe there's a way we can tell him without hurting his feelings.
Monica : I mean, come on. That is just noise!
UNK: It's not even a song.
UNK: Wait. If you listen very carefully...
UNK: ...I think it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.
UNK: - Hi. How are you? - Good.
Rachel : Remember when we were in the coffeehouse...
UNK: ...we decided I was gonna keep the cute guy's phone?
UNK: I was gonna keep it in my purse so if it rang, I could just pick it up?
Rachel : Do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?
Phoebe : Now you lost me.
Rachel : - You stole the phone. - No, I didn't.
UNK: You're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
Rachel : - No. - Okay.
Phoebe : But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.
Phoebe : Oh, it does work.
UNK: [scene : - Phoebe. - That is a different phone.
UNK: Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi, is Rachel there?
Rachel : Yes, she is. Just one moment, please. It's for me!
Phoebe : That is damning evidence.
UNK: Oh, my God. I bet that's him.
UNK: My digital fairy tale's about to begin.
UNK: I wonder how it should be? Should I be, "Hello"?
UNK: Or should I be, "Hi! It's Ra..."?
Rachel : Would you stop doing that?
UNK: Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
UNK: - Phoebe, you can't... - I'm on a call.
UNK: Yeah, you can pick it up tonight. Say, 8 : 30?
UNK: At my apartment.
UNK: It's 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.
UNK: And then maybe, you know, after, we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.
UNK: Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.
Rachel : You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Phoebe : How will you know what time to come over?
Rachel : You just said it.
UNK: Well, I was kind of hoping that I would just be alone.
UNK: You know, to think about my mom and her suicide.
Rachel : - Oh, Phoebe! - What? That's the first time today.
UNK: So you like the nachos, huh?
UNK: - Myself, I'm partial to... - I'm 16.
Joey : See you in 2003.
UNK: You're right. They are writing me out of the show.
