Phoebe : That does sound great. I'm gonna get the phone.
Rachel : What? Wait. Why do you get the story?
Phoebe : I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Rachel : Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
UNK: That wasn't a date. That was friends getting together and having sex.
UNK: Okay. Great. I get the phone.
UNK: No way. You just broke up with Tag a week ago.
UNK: Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again.
Phoebe : - Nice try. - Wait.
Rachel : How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Phoebe : I don't know.
Rachel : Maybe we could...
UNK: Aha! Too slow!
UNK: Aha! Too cocky.
