UNK: We'll be right back, sir.
Phoebe : - What do we do? - I don't know.
Phoebe : Can you believe this?
Phoebe : We were waiting for a hot guy, and then an even hotter one shows up.
Rachel : I know.
UNK: What?
UNK: They just don't make them like that anymore, you know?
Rachel : No, they do, but you just have to wait.
Phoebe : Rachel, listen...
Phoebe : ...if you let me have him, then I will really owe you one.
Rachel : All right.
UNK: All right, I will let you have him.
UNK: But you owe me. You owe me big.
UNK: Yeah. You're such a great friend.

UNK: Sure.
UNK: Oh, my God, it's true!
Monica : Oh, my God, you are so amazing.
Monica : Can I just ask you to do me just one favor?
UNK: Certainly.
Monica : Would you slap me right here in the face?
UNK: I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
Rachel : God, you seem really, really nice.
Joey : Okay, bye-bye.

Joey : All right, here we go.
UNK: No, wait. Just one more thing.

Rachel : - You are so beautiful. - So nice to meet you.
UNK: - My God, you're great. - Thanks for stopping by.
UNK: - I am so sorry about that. - Oh, no.
