Cecilia : - Oh, just years of experience. - Can I get some ice here?!
Joey : I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
UNK: You're not the fan who's dying, are you?
UNK: I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying.
UNK: But that's not suppose to be until later.
UNK: I'm Joey Tribbiani. We did a scene together yesterday.

UNK: ...about a character I've played for 20 years!
UNK: Miss Monroe... Oh, there you go.
