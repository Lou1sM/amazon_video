Rachel : No, Phoebe, you cannot get the phone that way. That's not fair.
Rachel : Okay, look, I have an idea.
UNK: Why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial...
UNK: ...and then whoever has more in common with him gets the phone.
UNK: Or we can decide by whoever's name is closer to the word "phone."
UNK: I don't think so.
UNK: Fine. But I bet you'd be singing a different tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
UNK: First name on the speed dial is "Mom."
UNK: Oh. I lost my mom to suicide.
UNK: No way. You can't use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Phoebe : Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Rachel : Well, now, see, this isn't telling us anything.
UNK: - "Joe. Carlos. Yoga. Ben..." - Wait. I do yoga. That's one for me.
UNK: Oh, all right. Oh, so close. If only it said, "yogurt."
UNK: "Peter Luger." That's a steak house.
UNK: Okay, fine. Meat-eater. Fine, that's one for you.
UNK: Oh, I win. He's got Barneys on his speed dial.
UNK: You don't know it's Barneys the store.
UNK: That could be his friend's house or a bar...
UNK: Who has Barneys the store on their speed dial?
