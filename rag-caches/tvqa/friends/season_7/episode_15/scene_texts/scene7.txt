Monica : Do you want some shortbread? It's Scottish, like you are.
UNK: Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage.
UNK: What?
UNK: Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by...
UNK: ...Vikings.
Chandler : Anyway, lots of bad memories.
UNK: It sounds to me like your family's ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.
UNK: No. No, they're not.
UNK: They're still very angry.
UNK: But, you know, Chandler's also half-Swedish.
Monica : You know what the Swedish people are famous for?
Monica : Sitting down and being quiet.
UNK: Yeah, but the Scottish history is so much...
UNK: You can't play bagpipes at the wedding!
Ross : How did you know about that?
UNK: - We heard you play from your apartment. - Were you the ones who called the cops?
UNK: That's not really important right now.
UNK: What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture...
UNK: ...we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Ross : - Why not? - Because we hate them.
