UNK: Wait, I thought you paid.
UNK: Apparently, we don't pay for food anymore.
Chandler : - Do you see what I see? - It's still there.
Chandler : Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Rachel : She could be out of town. Maybe gone for months.
UNK: By then, it may spoil. She can't come back to bad cheesecake.
UNK: - It could kill her. - Don't want that.
UNK: We're protecting her.
UNK: - We'll take it. - But quick.
Rachel : - Why? - I hear her in there.
Chandler : Go! Go! Go!
UNK: Do you think it's inappropriate to wear a white, lacy dress to a wedding?
Phoebe : - Yes. - Excellent.
UNK: Oh, my God, that's David.
Rachel : - Who? - David, the scientist guy.
Phoebe : David that I was in love with.
Phoebe : Who went to Russia and broke my heart, David.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: Say their name enough, they turn around.
UNK: Phoebe.
UNK: David.
Phoebe : What are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
UNK: I'm just in town for a conference.
David : God, you look phenomenal.
UNK: Well...
UNK: Yeah.
Phoebe : You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
UNK: Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.
UNK: Look, I got a confession to make.
David : I was hoping to run into you here.
UNK: I didn't know if I should call. I was only in town a few days...
UNK: ...and I didn't want to intrude on your life.
David : I really wanted to see you...
UNK: ...but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Phoebe : Of course I would want to see you. I think about you all the time.
David : Really? Because I think about you all the time.
UNK: There's a statue in Minsk that reminds me of you so much.
UNK: It's actually of Lenin...
UNK: ...but, you know, at certain angles...
UNK: Anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight?
UNK: Yes.
Phoebe : Oh, no!
Rachel : - What? - I can't.
UNK: I can't believe I have plans. Can you do it tomorrow?
David : No, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the redeye.
UNK: Listen, next time you're in Minsk...
Monica : Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe : What are you doing?
Phoebe : I have plans with Joey.
UNK: So? He'll understand.
UNK: No, he won't. And that's not even the point.
UNK: I made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends.
UNK: And now just because, potentially, the love of my life...
UNK: ...returns from Russia for one night...
Phoebe : ...I should change my beliefs?
Phoebe : I should change my beliefs!
UNK: No. If I don't have my principles, I don't have anything.
Monica : You're so strong.
UNK: Or I should rush through dinner with Joey and meet David at 9.
Rachel : Oh, my God, that is so good!
UNK: I'm full. And yet I know if I stop eating this...
UNK: ...I'll regret it.
UNK: Hey, what have you got there?
UNK: Oh, it's...
UNK: It's tofu cake. Want some?
Chandler : What are you doing tonight?
Chandler : Dude. Dude.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: I got plans with Phoebe.
UNK: Really? Monica said she had a date at 9.
Joey : - What? Tonight? - That's what Monica said.
UNK: After that speech, she makes a date on the same night she has plans with me?
UNK: She's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy.
UNK: - Now, if you'll excuse me... - Dude, dude!
UNK: If I took off my pants right now, how would you feel?
UNK: Like your cousin Glenn.
