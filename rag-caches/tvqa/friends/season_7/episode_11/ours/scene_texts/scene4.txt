UNK: You know, I don't I like this table either. Maybe we should move again.
UNK: No, we're staying right here. Excuse me, we're ready to order.
UNK: I don't work here.
UNK: Well, then you shouldn't be walking around.
UNK: The Waiter : - Are you guys ready? - Yes.
UNK: I'll have a green salad, house dressing and water's fine.
UNK: The Waiter : And for you, sir?
UNK: Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...
UNK: ...how slow are we talking?
UNK: It's already been roasted.
UNK: Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear the specials again.
UNK: We've heard the specials three times.
UNK: There's prime rib, mahi-mahi and a very special lobster ravioli.
UNK: - Actually, we're out of the ravioli. - Well, that changes everything!
UNK: You know what, Pheebs? You were right before.
Joey : Friends are so important.
UNK: Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
Joey : Know what I really want?
Rachel : - What? - Is to have a long, long talk.
UNK: You know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
UNK: The Waiter : - Any progress? - Yes.
Joey : I will have the lobster ravioli.
Phoebe : God, Joey, this is taking forever.
UNK: - What's the rush? - Well...
Phoebe : ...I have an appointment.
UNK: And it's very important.
Joey : What is it?
UNK: Well...
UNK: ...it's a date.
UNK: A date? No, you must be mistaken, because you wouldn't have a date...
Joey : ...on the same night you have plans with a friend.
UNK: Don't make me feel badly.
