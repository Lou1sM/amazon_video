UNK: No, I'm gonna!
Joey : You made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl.
Joey : Like I did something terrible. Now you're doing the same thing.
UNK: It's not! It's totally different!
Phoebe : This is with David. Remember David, the scientist guy?
UNK: He's very special to me.
UNK: My girl the other night was special. She was a scientist too.
Joey : - She was? - Well, she graduated high school.
UNK: Whatever. Know what?
UNK: He's only here for four hours and I'm gonna go see him.
Rachel : - Fine! - Yeah.
UNK: What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli!
UNK: I was about to leave. I didn't think you were coming.
UNK: I wouldn't have missed this.
UNK: Well, I'm very glad you're here.
UNK: Oh, you're such a gentleman.
UNK: Come on, we're going to my place.
Chandler : Are you eating the cheesecake without me?
UNK: I will give you $ 100 to whistle right now.
UNK: - How can you eat it without me? - What'll you do?
UNK: Tell Monica or Joey? No, you'd have to tell them everything.
Rachel : We're dessert stealers. We're living outside the law.
UNK: I don't trust you with this cake.
Chandler : I got it first, and I'm taking it back!
UNK: - What? Oh, no. - Oh, yes.
Rachel : You think I trust you with it?
UNK: No, we'll split it.
UNK: That's not fair. You had some.
Rachel : I think Monica would be very interested to know...
Rachel : ...that you called her cheesecake "dry and mealy."
Chandler : What do we use to split it?
Rachel : All right, pick a half.
Chandler : Well, this side looks bigger.
UNK: But there's more crust on this side.
UNK: Maybe if I measure it...
Rachel : Pick a piece!
UNK: - All right, I pick that one. - It's the smaller piece.
Rachel : Okay. There you go.
Rachel : Enjoy your half, my friend. But that is it.
Rachel : No sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me...
Rachel : ...if you eat your piece too fast.
UNK: - You gonna give me some of yours? - Oh, no.
Chandler : No switching, no sharing. And don't come crying to me.
Chandler : I may just sit here and have my cake all day.
Chandler : Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
UNK: Ross, sweetheart!
Ross : Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.
UNK: - Isn't it a beautiful wedding? - Yes, it is.
