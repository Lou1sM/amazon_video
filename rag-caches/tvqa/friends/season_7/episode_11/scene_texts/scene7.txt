Monica : Am I doing here? Surprised to see me?
Monica : Ross brought me. How do you like that?
Ross : Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.
Monica : You invite my whole family, and not me? Why?
UNK: Why wouldn't you want me here? What could I have done?
UNK: Stuart!
Frannie : I believe you know my husband.
UNK: So it's really a question of "who" could you have done.
UNK: I hate this, but I have to go.
UNK: I can't miss my flight.
UNK: I bet there's another flight to Minsk in...
UNK: July.
UNK: That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
UNK: "Please clean my beakers."
UNK: I don't get out of the lab much.
UNK: I thought it meant something else.
UNK: Yeah, well, I really actually wanted to say...
UNK: ...that.
UNK: But I figured I probably shouldn't because...
UNK: ...I have to leave.
UNK: No, you're right. Don't say it.
David : I do, though.
Phoebe : I do too.
UNK: Well, bye, Phoebe.
UNK: Now's not the time, Joey. You can yell at me tomorrow.
UNK: Wait, no, Pheebs. I'm not gonna yell at you.
UNK: I just started thinking about you and David...
UNK: ...and I remember how bummed you were the first time he left.
Joey : Oh, Pheebs, come here.
Joey : - Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay.
UNK: The only guy I've ever been crazy about is going to Minsk...
UNK: ...and I may never see him again.
Joey : You could always visit him.
UNK: Right. Like they'll let me have a passport.
Joey : Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
UNK: Well, now...
UNK: ...if you achieve distillation of subatomic particles before he does...
UNK: ...then he could come back.
UNK: I could give it a shot.
UNK: Oh, look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it.
Chandler : - Stick to your side! - Come on, now!
UNK: All right, what are we having?
Monica : - Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap. - Oh, I'll wait here for you.
UNK: - I can't go back there! - Why?
UNK: Did you see the way Stuart was staring at me? I think he still wants me.
Rachel : - Oh, my God. - Just go do it!
UNK: All right, wait here.
UNK: Aunt Millie : Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving?
Chandler : - Well... - Give us a kiss. Come on.
Ross : Why? Why on the lips?
