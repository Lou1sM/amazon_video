Ross : Here, I think this is us.
Monica : Limited seating, my ass.
UNK: Let's see who made the cut.
UNK: Hi. I'm Monica Geller.
UNK: - How do you know the bride and groom? - I worked with Frannie.
Monica : Used to work with her. Used to.
UNK: I'm a relative and I didn't get invited.
Monica : A blood relative. Blood.
Ross : Stop saying "blood" to strangers.
UNK: From the ages of 7 to 9, we were inseparable, and I didn't even get invited!
UNK: Then why are you here?
UNK: - I'm my brother's date. - Hey, I had a date, okay?
UNK: Joan Tedeschi, the linguist.
Monica : So how about you? How do you know the happy couple?
UNK: The Second Guest : We went to college with both of them.
UNK: The Second Guest : Now we live next door.
UNK: Okay, you're fine.
UNK: You know, you would've liked Joan, she's very pleasant.
UNK: There! There! Her back looks like that. That's not broad, is it?
UNK: Come on, Joey, you've got to be ready to order by now.
