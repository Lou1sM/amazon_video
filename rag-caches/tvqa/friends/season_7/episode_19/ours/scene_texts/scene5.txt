UNK: We have a lot of options. A number of prototypes for you to try on.
UNK: Those look great.
UNK: Okay, this one's a mushroom cap. This one is made of bologna.
Joey : - The toothpicks? - Just until the glue dries.
Ross : Thank God.
UNK: These are more realistic, but perishable.
Monica : Over here, we have pink suede, which is nice.
UNK: But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

Monica : I also did a little something in fur, but that's really just for me.
UNK: Why don't you try these on? We'll get a better idea of what works.
Joey : Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
