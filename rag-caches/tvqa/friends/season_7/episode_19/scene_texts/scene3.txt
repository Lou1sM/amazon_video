Phoebe : Okay, but look. Look at what I got.
UNK: It's her address book. We have a guest list.
UNK: You're amazing. Did you pull that out of her purse?
Phoebe : Uh-huh. And a little seed money for the party.
UNK: Cassie?
Cassie : Hey, Ross!
UNK: It's been so long!
Cassie : Last time I saw you...
Cassie : ...you were setting up your tent in line for Return of the Jedi.
UNK: That's right.
Ross : So you did see me that day. Because it seemed like you didn't.
Cassie : - Yeah, sorry about that. - It's okay. Come on in.
Cassie : Thanks for letting me stay here. Monica's place was nice.
Cassie : Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!
Ross : I have a knack for impressions.
Cassie : Maybe after we get re-acquainted you could do me.
UNK: Yeah. No!
UNK: How you doing on that...
Ross : ...hot dog?
UNK: - I'm all done. - Thank God.
UNK: The last time we hung out was when our parents rented that beach house.
UNK: Remember the time I pinned you down and tickled you until you cried?
UNK: We're probably too old to do that now.
UNK: I'll always remember that summer. It's when I got all these freckles.
UNK: I'll always remember that summer...
UNK: ...because that's when I realized that we are related.
UNK: You know, we're not just two random people thrown together.
UNK: We share genetic material.
Cassie : It took you that long to figure it out?
UNK: I'm a little slow.
Ross : Just as our children would be.
Joey : - Hi. - Hi.
UNK: How are you? Good. Hi. Thanks for coming.
UNK: Thank you. So nice to see you.
UNK: - No, thanks. - Okay. Hey, Rach?
Joey : - Yeah? - Who the hell are all these people?
UNK: I don't know. I called everybody in her book.
UNK: These are the ones that could show up on 24 hours' notice.
UNK: There's a word for people like that : Losers.
UNK: Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor.
