Phoebe : Oh, hey! How was your audition?
UNK: I'm sorry, do I know you?
Phoebe : What are you doing?
Joey : Practicing blowing you off. I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Phoebe : You got it?
UNK: - Not yet, but the audition went great! - What's it for?
UNK: A big-budget period movie about three Italian brothers...
UNK: ...who come to America at the turn of the century. It's classy.
UNK: The director's supposed to be the next-next Martin Scorsese.
UNK: The "next-next"?
UNK: A guy from Chicago's supposed to be the next Martin Scorsese.
UNK: This guy's right after him.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to the casting people. They loved you!
Joey : They loved me!
UNK: They want to see you again tomorrow.
Joey : - My God! - There's just one thing.
Estelle : Do you have a problem with full-frontal nudity?
Joey : Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!
UNK: Oh.
Joey : Okay, let me call you back.
UNK: - What's the matter? - They want me naked in the movie.
Monica : - Wow! - I know.
UNK: - My grandmother's gonna see this. - Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
UNK: The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin
UNK: A "no sex" pact, huh?
UNK: I have one of those with every woman in America.
Monica : Will you give me a hand making up the guest bedroom?
UNK: Cousin Cassie's staying with us for a few days.
UNK: Cassie? I haven't seen her in, like, forever.
Ross : I wonder if she still carries a Barbie everywhere?
UNK: - She's 25 years old. - So? I still...
UNK: You're probably right.
Rachel : Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Monica : Subtle, guys.
UNK: What?
UNK: I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
UNK: Okay, well, don't ruin it. Just play along, at least.
Monica : Okay. Sorry.
Rachel : We have to throw her a shower?
UNK: What'd you decide to do about the movie?
UNK: I don't know. I mean...
UNK: It's not like it's porn. This is a serious, legitimate movie.
UNK: Nudity's really important to the story.
UNK: That's what you say about porn.
UNK: Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.
Monica : No, you should. A lot of major actors do nude scenes.
Monica : The chance to star in a movie? Come on!
UNK: That's true. And I'm only naked in one scene. It sounds really great.
UNK: My character's Catholic. He falls in love with a Jewish girl.
UNK: We run away and get caught in a big rainstorm.
UNK: We go into a barn, undress each other and hold each other.
UNK: It's really sweet and tender.
UNK: Plus, everyone will see your thing!
Phoebe : When can we have this shower?
UNK: She has so much going on, we have only two options.
Rachel : - We have Friday. - That's just two days away.
