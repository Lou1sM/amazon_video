UNK: Okay, the taffy's too sticky.
UNK: I was afraid of that.
Joey : - Toothpick? - Yeah.
UNK: - What are you trying now? - The Fruit Roll-up.
UNK: [scene : - And? - Delicious.
Joey : Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We have a winner!
Monica : What? Which one?
Joey : The Silly Putty. Not so silly anymore!
UNK: She's your cousin. She's your cousin.
Ross : If she knew what was going on in your head, she'd think you were sick.
Ross : Or would she? Let's back up for a second.
Ross : She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.
Ross : She was the one who turned down the lights.
Ross : She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run...
Ross : ...the sexiest movie ever.
Ross : I know that look.
Ross : Forget it. I want it. She wants it.
UNK: I'm going in.
Cassie : What the hell are you doing?
Ross : Say something clever.
UNK: Okay, doesn't have to be clever.
Ross : Just has to be words. Say some words.
Ross : Any words will do.
Ross : Oh, my God, this is the longest...
Ross : ...that anyone has not talked ever!
UNK: There is nothing you could say to make this worse...
Ross : ...so just say something!
UNK: I haven't had sex in a very long time.
UNK: Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
UNK: Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.
Monica : I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice?
Rachel : - Oh, Monica. We are so sorry. - For what?
Rachel : First, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
UNK: Then, forgetting to invite you to it.
Monica : You already had it?
Phoebe : We called everyone in your phone book. A bunch of people came.
Phoebe : It took us so long to get you here that they had to leave.
Rachel : We wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower.
UNK: Now you don't have either.
Phoebe : We ruined everything.
UNK: No, wait a minute, that's not true. What you did was really sweet.
UNK: - It kind of works out for the best. - What do you mean?
Monica : Now I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love.
UNK: I get all those presents without talking to people I don't even like!
Monica : - Surprise. - Surprise, Monica.
UNK: What's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
UNK: My whole family's from Naples.
UNK: That's great. Okay. I've heard everything I need to hear...
Rachel : We just need to, uh...
UNK: Leslie?
UNK: The Casting Director : - Joey, this is the awkward part. - Hey, right. Not a problem.
Joey : I totally understand you need...
UNK: ...to make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos.
UNK: Don't you worry.
Joey : I have nothing to hide.
UNK: So, there you go. That's me.
Joey : One hundred percent natural.
UNK: I tell you, that has never happened before.
Phoebe : Cassie, are you finding everything okay?
UNK: Yeah. Thanks for letting me stay here.
UNK: Oh, it's no problem.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Say something. Say anything.
UNK: Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
