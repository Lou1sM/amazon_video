UNK: Hey, I'm back.
UNK: The Casting Director : Hi, Joey.
UNK: Will I read the same scene again?
UNK: The Casting Director : I tried to call you. You didn't need to come today.
Rachel : Oh, great.
UNK: I'd have been perfect for this part.
UNK: You made a bad decision and ruined your movie. Good day!
UNK: You didn't need to come, because the director saw your tape and loved it.
Joey : And, scene.
UNK: Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!
UNK: So, you were saying?
UNK: The director wants to meet you tomorrow.
UNK: Wow! Sure! That's great.
UNK: The Casting Director : Your agent said you're okay with nudity.
UNK: Yeah, sure. As long as it's handled tastefully.
Joey : And that barn is not too cold.
UNK: Perfect. There's one more thing.
UNK: It's important to the director that everything in the movie's authentic.
UNK: The Casting Director : In your love scene with Sarah...
UNK: ...she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.
UNK: So...
Ross : So... what?
UNK: So, the director is insisting that whoever play that part...
UNK: The Casting Director : ...be authentically, anatomically...
UNK: The Casting Director : ...not Jewish. You know what I'm saying?
UNK: Yes!
Joey : No. What?
UNK: The Casting Director : An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
UNK: Bar mitzvah-ed?
UNK: Think 13 years earlier, lose the rabbi, add a scalpel.
UNK: - To get this part, you can't be... - No.
Monica : But you are?
UNK: - You told them you weren't? - That's right.
UNK: Wow!
UNK: It's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with?
Monica : - What were you thinking? - I don't know. I just want this part.
UNK: They say no matter what you're asked during an audition, say yes.
Joey : They want you to ride a horse, say you can.
UNK: You figure out how to do it later.
Monica : This is not like learning to ride a horse. This is like learning...
UNK: ...to grow a turtleneck.
UNK: I know, okay? Tomorrow, when I go meet the director...
UNK: ...I have to take my clothes off so they can see what my body looks like.
Monica : Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?
UNK: I have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
UNK: Unless...
Joey : Unless what?
Monica : This may sound crazy, but there may be something we could...
UNK: ...fashion.
Joey : - Like what? - Well, I'm not sure yet.
Monica : Off the top of my head, I'm thinking...
UNK: ...double-sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
UNK: I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower.
UNK: We get mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them.
UNK: Then inside is each person's individual birthstone.
Rachel : Okay. Okay.
Rachel : You take care of that.
UNK: Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we don't have a guest list.
UNK: Okay. Who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey, what's up?
UNK: I'm making something for Joey. Can I raid your fridge?
Rachel : Have at it.
UNK: All right. Turkey? That won't work.
UNK: Cheese? That won't work.
UNK: Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
UNK: Are you making him a sandwich?
UNK: No, it's more like a wrap.
UNK: Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.
UNK: So you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Rachel : We have to get her a present?
