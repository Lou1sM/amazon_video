Phoebe : - What is the other option? - Yesterday.
UNK: If we make it yesterday, we're done!
UNK: It's impossible. We can't do this by Friday.
Rachel : We have to find a place, invite people, get food.
UNK: There's too much to do.
Rachel : - We cannot do it! - Calm down!
UNK: Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry.
Phoebe : Just calm down, woman!
UNK: Phoebe, I already did.
Phoebe : All right, then I need to calm down.
Rachel : I think we can do this if we just get organized.
Rachel : We have two days to plan this party. We need to make fast decisions.
UNK: Where will we have it?
Phoebe : - Here. What time? - 4 : 00. Food?
Phoebe : - Finger sandwiches and tea. - Great! Very Monica.
Phoebe : - And chili! - You went one too far.
Rachel : - Flowers or balloons? - Both.
UNK: - We're paying for this. - Neither.
UNK: - What should we do for a theme? - Lusts of the Flesh!
Phoebe : - What? - I don't know. Cowboy theme?
UNK: I'm glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Monica : Oh, boy. Me too.
UNK: I was thinking, say we had a big fight, and broke up for a few hours.
Chandler : Technically, we could have sex again.
Chandler : What do you think, bossy and domineering?
UNK: The wedding's off, sloppy and immature.
UNK: That's me. Come on.
UNK: Wait. Cassie's in the guest room. We're going to lunch.
Chandler : Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!
Monica : Shrill? The wedding is back on.
Cassie : I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Chandler : - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
UNK: - So, ready to go? - Yeah.
UNK: [scene : - Chandler? - I'll be right with you.
Monica : - Cassie needs to stay at your place. - Why?
UNK: Because "Pervie Perverson" here can't stop staring at her.
UNK: Chandler, she's our cousin!
UNK: I wasn't staring. I was listening intently.
UNK: It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch.
Chandler : Say something.
Monica : You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Ross : Fine. She can stay at my place.
UNK: What does Cassie look like now?
Monica : Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Chandler : This Aunt Marilyn, is she coming to the wedding?
UNK: Wafer-thin ice.
