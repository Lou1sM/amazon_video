Rachel : You have been maid of honor before?
UNK: You see? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie.
UNK: That's it. I am maid of honor.
UNK: - No, I am. - How come you are?
Phoebe : Because I cared enough to lie.
UNK: Hey, I could help you decide who should do it.
UNK: We could have an audition.
UNK: See how you'd handle maid-of-honor-type situations.
UNK: - What do you mean? - When I want a job...
UNK: ...I audition and if I'm the best of the people they see...
UNK: ...I get the part.
UNK: Then they send you a script. You go to the set.
UNK: You rehearse and you have wardrobe fittings.
UNK: Then you shoot your part. And it's great.
UNK: But right after that, you're back out on the street looking for work again.
UNK: Right back where you started.
UNK: So I gotta say, I don't think a career in acting is the right choice for you two.
UNK: Joey, the maid of honor thing.
UNK: Right.
UNK: So, okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Joey : Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.
UNK: - It's better than us deciding. - Oh, this is crazy.
UNK: - Can't we just flip a coin? - No, coins hate me.
UNK: Okay, fine. You know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
UNK: Hi!
Rachel : Ross, sweetie.
UNK: Hey there, handsome thing.
Ross : Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Giorgio.
UNK: Hey.
Ross : Just brought back your videos.
UNK: Hey, Ross. Look, I think we need to talk about before.
UNK: No. No, we don't.
Joey : Yes, we do.
Joey : Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had.
UNK: I don't know what you're talking about.
Joey : Come on, admit it.
Joey : That was the best nap you ever had.
UNK: I've had better.
Joey : Okay. When?
Ross : All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
UNK: I said it, okay?
UNK: But it's over, Joey!
Joey : I want to do it again.
UNK: We can't do it again.
Joey : - Why not? - Because it's weird!
UNK: Fine.
UNK: You want a drink?
Ross : - Sure. What do you got? - Warm milk and Excedrin PM.
UNK: Chandler.
Monica : I just figured out who you are.
UNK: Can you figure out what I'm doing?
UNK: - You're Louis Posen. - Who?
Monica : He was my best friend in fifth grade.
Monica : One day, I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no.
Monica : Do you know why?
Chandler : Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?
Monica : No, but because he thought I was too fa...
Monica : Every time I think about it, I feel as bad as I did then.
UNK: I really think you should apologize to Julie.
UNK: Honey, are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica : It would make me feel better if Louis apologized to me.
UNK: I'll do it. But I warn you, this may make me a better person.
Chandler : And that is not the man you fell in love with.
UNK: - I can live with that. - Okay.
UNK: - So how do we find her. - She probably lives in the city.
UNK: - She was eating in that restaurant. - I'll bet she was.
UNK: What is wrong with me?
UNK: Okay, we'll give you hypothetical maid-of-honor situations.
Joey : You'll be scored on a scale of one to ten.
UNK: - One being the highest. - Ten is the highest.
Joey : - Why is 10 the highest? - Because it's the highest.
UNK: Okay, Rachel, you're up first.
