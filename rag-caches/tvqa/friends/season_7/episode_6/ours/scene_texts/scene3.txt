UNK: I'm gonna marry someone good.
Phoebe : Oh, I know.
Rachel : Better than Chandler.
Ross : - What happened? - I don't know.
Ross : We fell asleep. That is all.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
UNK: All right, well, I'd better go.
Ross : - I think that would be best. - Yeah.
UNK: - I'll talk to you later. - Okay.
Ross : - But not about this. - No, never. Never!
Joey : - Bye. - No touch. No touch.
UNK: [scene : Die Hard!
UNK: Opening a topless carwash was a great idea.
UNK: We'll definitely have enough money to open our bikini shop.
UNK: Now we mince the shallots like this.
UNK: Look, honey, the nice people are chopping shallots.
UNK: Maybe if they chop enough of them, they can open that bikini shot.
UNK: Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.
Monica : This woman overheard that I was marrying you...
UNK: ...and she wished me good luck.
UNK: That's sweet.
UNK: No, it was more like a "good luck."
UNK: Well, do you think she meant, "Good luck taming that wild stallion."
UNK: Not judging you, a little gay.
Chandler : So, what did this woman look like?
Monica : She was, like, 30, dark hair, attractive.
Chandler : Any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
UNK: Was it someone you dated in college?
Chandler : No, I only dated two girls in college...
UNK: ...both blond, both not attractive.
Chandler : Let me check this out.
Monica : - What are you doing? - Well, let's see.
Chandler : Okay, is that her?
Monica : Oh, my God, yes!
Monica : - Who is she? - Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.
Monica : Did you break up with her?
UNK: No, we're still together.
Chandler : We went out for two summers and then I broke up with her.
Monica : - Why? - She came back the third summer...
UNK: ...and she'd gotten really fa...
Monica : - Fat? - I did not say fat.
UNK: I said fa...
Monica : You broke up with a girl because she was fat?
Rachel : Yeah. Yeah.
UNK: But it was a really long time ago. Does she still feel bad?
Monica : Apparently she does.
UNK: You know what they say : "Elephants never forget."
Chandler : Seriously, good luck marrying me.
UNK: Rach, wanna come with me Friday night? I'm gonna check out some male strippers.
UNK: For the bachelorette party?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Hey, what's going on?
UNK: She's Monica's maid of honor.
Joey : Hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs.
