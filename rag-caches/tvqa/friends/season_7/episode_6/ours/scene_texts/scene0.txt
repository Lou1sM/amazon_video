UNK: The reason I asked you to brunch...
UNK: ...is because I've been thinking about my maid of honor.
UNK: Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.
UNK: I hope it's you.
UNK: - I hope it's you. - Me too.
Monica : First of all, I love you both so much.
UNK: - You're both so important to me. - Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?
UNK: I was thinking we could come up with a system...
Monica : ...where we trade off being maid of honor.
Monica : - Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine... - Yes! Oh.
UNK: Hypothetically.
UNK: Still.
UNK: If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.
Monica : We all get to do it and no one gets upset.
UNK: - That's a pretty good idea. - I'll do that. So, who's yours?
UNK: Well, that's the best part. You guys get to decide.
Phoebe : - Why is that the best part? - I don't have to.
Rachel : Of course we'll help you decide. We'll do anything we can to help you.
Rachel : I'd like to make a toast.
Rachel : To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...
Rachel : ...my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that...
Monica : - Really not deciding. - Fine.
Ross : Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.
UNK: - You're marrying Chandler Bing? - Yeah.
Phoebe : Good luck!
UNK: Oh, and good luck to you too!
Phoebe : What a nice lady.
