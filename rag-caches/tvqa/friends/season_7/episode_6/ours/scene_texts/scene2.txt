Phoebe : - Hey, Rachel. - Yeah?
Phoebe : When I get married, will you be my maid of honor?
UNK: Really?
Rachel : Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean, I'm just...
Rachel : Wait a minute.
UNK: If I'm your maid of honor, that means that you are Monica's.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Well, if that's what you want.
Rachel : No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's.
Phoebe : - Why does it even matter? - Why does it matter to you?
Phoebe : Because this one is now.
UNK: And it's two of our best friends.
UNK: And who knows what you're gonna marry.
UNK: What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?
UNK: You wouldn't.
Phoebe : Okay, look, Rachel. I know you really want to do this...
UNK: ...but I've never been maid of honor to anyone before.
UNK: I know you've done it at least twice.
Rachel : - Yeah, but Phoebe... - Please let me finish.
Phoebe : I guess that was it.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Since you've never done it before, you can be Monica's maid of honor.
Phoebe : Oh, thank you so much!
UNK: Yay.
