UNK: Situation number one : You're with Monica.
UNK: The wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
UNK: I don't want to marry Chandler.
UNK: - I've got cold feet. - It's gonna be okay.
UNK: One man the rest of my life? I don't know.
UNK: This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.
Rachel : Look, Monica...
Rachel : ...getting cold feet is very common.
UNK: It's just because of all the anticipation.
Rachel : And you just have to remember that you love Chandler.
Rachel : And also, I ran out on a wedding.
UNK: You don't get to keep the gifts.
Joey : Drawing on your own experience.
Joey : Very good.
Ross : Yes, very nice, Rachel.
Rachel : Thank you, judges.
Phoebe : - Kiss ass. - Oh.
Joey : - Okay, Phoebe. - Yes, Your Honor.
UNK: We're now in the ceremony.
Joey : Monica is about to say, "I do"...
Joey : ...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.
Joey : What do you do? Go!
Ross : When Monica was a little girl...
Ross : ...I remember that...
UNK: Ow!
Joey : - Very good! - Oh.
Joey : Yes, excellent. Perfect score.
Rachel : She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
UNK: Hey, you want a little taste of Pheebs?
UNK: Ladies, please. Please.
UNK: Okay, the next situation is for Rachel.
UNK: The wedding is about to start.
UNK: You walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross.
UNK: I'll be Monica. Go!
UNK: No, no, no!
UNK: This situation is not sanctioned!
UNK: Now, we're moving on to the next one.
UNK: Okay.
Ross : It is time for you to give your maid-of-honor speech.
UNK: We haven't even prepared...
Rachel : - Go! - Okay, okay, okay.
UNK: Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as...
UNK: Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks! Okay, never mind. Forget it.
Rachel : I met... I met Monica when we were just a couple of 6-year-olds...
UNK: ...and became friends with Chandler when he was 25...
Rachel : ...although he seemed like a 6-year-old.
UNK: Oh.
Rachel : Thank you. Thank you very much.
UNK: I've known them separately and together.
Rachel : To know them as a couple is to know that you are in the presence of love.
Rachel : So I would like to raise my glass...
Rachel : ...to Monica and Chandler...
Rachel : ...and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.
Rachel : I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: - Great speech. - Yeah, it really was.
UNK: Oh, thanks.
UNK: Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next. Although I really don't see the point.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
