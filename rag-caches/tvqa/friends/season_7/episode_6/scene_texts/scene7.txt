Chandler : Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Monica : Keep going.
Chandler : So you can balloon up or you can shrink down...
Chandler : ...and I will still love you.
UNK: Even if I were to shrink down to 2 inches tall?
UNK: I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Monica : I love you.
UNK: Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.
Rachel : Hi, Pheebs.
Monica : - Hi. - Hi.
Rachel : I just want to apologize.
UNK: I'm really sorry I was a baby.
UNK: That's ridiculous. Rachel, we were all babies once.
UNK: Oh, you mean today. Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.
UNK: And I was thinking about it.
UNK: If you're Monica's maid of honor, I get to be yours.
Phoebe : - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.
Rachel : When Monica and Chandler got engaged, I put some stuff together.
Rachel : - Just in case. - Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.
Rachel : Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves.
UNK: Oh, God, this is funny. Look.
UNK: Here's a picture from one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.
Rachel : She made me carry her train...
Rachel : ...which was weird because I was Wonder Woman.
UNK: Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.
UNK: I just thought they could hold the rings in there.
Rachel : - Oh. - Something. And...
UNK: ...vintage handkerchiefs, you know, because people cry at weddings.
UNK: I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
Phoebe : This stuff is great.
Rachel : I forgot this was in here.
Rachel : This was the garter that I was saving for my wedding.
Rachel : And I wanted it to be Monica's "something borrowed."
UNK: And it's blue.
UNK: Rach, I think that you should be Monica's maid of honor.
Monica : You do?
Monica : - Why? - Because I think it means more to you.
UNK: But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.
Phoebe : It's fine. I mean, this is something...
UNK: ...that you've been thinking about since you were, what, 14?
UNK: No, I was 10. I just developed early.
Phoebe : Man alive!
UNK: - Hey, what's going on? - Hey!
UNK: We decided Rachel is going to be your maid of honor.
UNK: Oh, that's great!
UNK: Oh, wow. Okay, we really have to start planning.
UNK: I have really specific ideas.
UNK: We should meet four times a week.
UNK: Come to my place, we'll get together before work.
UNK: What do you say, 6 : 30, my place? So excited!
Rachel : Yeah, okay. You laugh now.
UNK: She's gonna be yours.
Joey : Great nap.
Ross : It really was.
Joey : What the hell are you doing?
UNK: God!
Ross : Excuse me.
