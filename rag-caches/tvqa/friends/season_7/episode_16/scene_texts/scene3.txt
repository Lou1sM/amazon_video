Joey : Listen, this is just the first draft, so...
Joey : "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion...
Joey : ...to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.

Rachel : ...and sweet little Ben?"
UNK: - That's nice. Well, come on in. - Okay.
UNK: I'll make some coffee and we can chat.
UNK: I'd love that. I would love that.
Rachel : So where is sweet little Ben?
Rachel : I would love to have a little...
Rachel : I found him!
Rachel : Very funny. Come here.
UNK: That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you, okay?
UNK: - Rachel, you want sugar? - Yes, but...
Rachel : Do I want sugar in my coffee?
Rachel : No, just some milk would be good, Carol. Thanks.

UNK: - Damn it! - Oh, crap!
UNK: "Oh, crap!"

UNK: - Stop being a baby. - Interesting you should call me that...
Phoebe : ...now that I may never have one.
UNK: Okay, I got some more written, ready?
UNK: Yeah, okay.
Joey : "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share...
UNK: ...I can't help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving...
UNK: ...and giving..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
UNK: - How about "receiving"? - Yes!
