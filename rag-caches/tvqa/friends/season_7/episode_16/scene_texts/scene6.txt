UNK: Eh, we weren't that close anyway.
Chandler : Joey, Joey, Joey...!
UNK: Hey.
Chandler : Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie...
UNK: Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
UNK: No!
UNK: It's cool, I'm still with my bridesmaid.
UNK: Where are the condoms?
Chandler : In my bag over there.
Chandler : Could you leave me one?
Joey : For just you?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Why don't you come downstairs with me. There's some really nice girls down there.
UNK: No, I'm fine.
UNK: All right. There you go, buddy.
Joey : Go nuts.
UNK: That's what that was?
UNK: Because that other thing, I thought you were onto something. But it did nothing for me.
Monica : Can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
UNK: If I hadn't left you one, you two might've never gotten together.
UNK: Imagine if I had sent that hooker like I was gonna?
UNK: It's like it was in the stars.
UNK: Yeah, totally meant to be.
Phoebe : Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Rachel : - What? - What?
UNK: What?
Chandler : Who did you originally want to hook up with?
UNK: Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.
Monica : I was really depressed, okay? And really drunk.
UNK: I wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted sex.
UNK: So, when I went to your room that night...
UNK: ...I was actually looking for Joey.
Joey : Yeah, baby.
Joey : No, baby.
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
UNK: You came looking for Joey?
UNK: - Were you planning on telling me this? - No, I didn't think it was important.
UNK: It's not important? It's not important?
UNK: If it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him not me.
UNK: No. The point is, it was you that was there that night.
UNK: It is you that I'm marrying. It is you that I fell in love with.
Joey : And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv...
UNK: Weird. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner-up.
Monica : Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey wasn't there?
UNK: Hey!
UNK: I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings.
UNK: There's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay?
UNK: What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.
UNK: I was with my bridesmaid.
UNK: And who's to say I would've said yes?
UNK: I mean, I would've said yes.
Joey : You are making way too big a deal out of this.
Joey : Everything worked out okay.
UNK: It's just weird, okay?
UNK: I don't want to be saying my vows with the mental image of you and Monica.
UNK: I need... I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
UNK: - Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal. - It is to me.
Chandler : You wanted to sleep with Batman and settled for Robin.
