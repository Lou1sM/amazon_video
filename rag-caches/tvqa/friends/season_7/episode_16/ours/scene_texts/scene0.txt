Ross : - Hi. - Hi! Hi, Ben.
Ross : - Hi. - We have a bathroom emergency.
Rachel : Go ahead.
UNK: Before we do, are any of Joey's special "romance" magazines in there?
Rachel : - No. - Okay, all clear.
Ben : Thanks, Phoebe.
UNK: That's Rachel.
Rachel : But whatever.
Ross : - Everything okay in there? - Don't talk to me now.
Rachel : Just like his daddy.
UNK: Could you do me a big favor?
UNK: I have a meeting at the dean's office.
UNK: Can you watch Ben for an hour?
Rachel : - What about Monica? - She isn't home.
Rachel : So it would just be me alone?
Ross : Ben would be there.
UNK: What's the matter?
UNK: I've never done that before. Me and him, alone.
UNK: He's not an ex-con.
Rachel : Okay, okay...
Rachel : - What do I do with him? - I don't know, talk to him.
UNK: Entertain him. Keep him alive.
Ross : - Okay. - Ben, come here.
UNK: I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?
Ross : Gonna be okay?
Rachel : - I think so. - I wasn't talking to you.
UNK: - I'll be okay. - Okay. I'll see you soon, buddy.
Ross : - Be back in an hour. - Bye Dad.
Rachel : - So this is fun, huh? - Not really.
UNK: - Okay. Want something to drink? - Okay.
UNK: Great. All right, how do you feel about Diet Coke?
UNK: - I'm not allowed to have soda. - Okay.
UNK: Well, that's pretty much all that we have.
Rachel : Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
UNK: What's a virgin?
Rachel : Water it is.
UNK: The One With The Truth About London
Chandler : Easy for you to say, you'd be wearing a veil.
UNK: - And the third guy? - He kept staring at your chest.
Monica : Can you blame him?
UNK: I don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...
UNK: ...while he's thinking, "I'd do it too."
Monica : - Well, then we still have a problem. - With what?
UNK: We need someone to perform our wedding but they're all boring or annoying...
UNK: ...or keep staring at the ladies.
Phoebe : You should have one of us do it.
UNK: We're getting "married" married, not "6th-grade" married.
UNK: No, it's a real thing.
UNK: Anyone can be ordained on the Internet and perform weddings and stuff.
UNK: - Are you serious? - A friend of mine did it. It's totally legal.
Joey : I call it!
UNK: What? It was my idea!
Chandler : Thank you very much, but neither of you is marrying us.
Joey : Does calling it not mean anything anymore?
UNK: We're having a legitimate clergy member.
Chandler : And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...
Chandler : ...and in control of his saliva.
UNK: - Is that lemon poppy seed? - You don't want these. They're stale.
UNK: - I'm leaving them outside for the pigeons. - I call them!
UNK: Ben, you know, when you were a baby...
UNK: ...we'd hang out all the time.
UNK: I was your daddy's girlfriend.
UNK: But you're not anymore.
UNK: - No, I'm not. - Because you guys were on a break...
Rachel : Hey, we were not on a...
UNK: That's fine. You know what Ben?
Rachel : One day when you are a lot older, I'm gonna tell you that entire story...
UNK: ...over a real pitcher of margaritas. Okay?
UNK: - When's my daddy coming back? - Fifty-two minutes.
UNK: So no brothers or sisters, huh?
Rachel : That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Ben : Sharing is good.
UNK: You're one of those.
UNK: You know what, I had two sisters and we just tortured each other.
Ben : - Really? Like how? - Well, you know, we would...
