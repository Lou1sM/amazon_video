Joey : And you just know it's gonna last forever.
UNK: That's what you should say.
UNK: What?
UNK: When you're marrying us, that's what you should say.
UNK: Really? I could do it?
UNK: I'd love you to do it.
UNK: Hey.
Chandler : But those are the words. Those exact words.
UNK: Well, I don't remember exactly but...
UNK: ...it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
UNK: I'm sorry to do this to you again...
UNK: ...but could you look after Ben for a little bit?
UNK: I've got this meeting at school.
UNK: And he asked for his "fun" Aunt Rachel.
Rachel : Well, of course I will watch him. We have fun, don't we, Ben?
UNK: - Okay, see you later, pal. - Okay.
UNK: - Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it. - What?
UNK: Can't let him go out that way. He's got a meeting.
UNK: - You got something here on your back. - What?
UNK: That's great. That is great.
Ross : What did we just finish talking about, Ben?
UNK: "What did we just finish talking about, Ben?"
UNK: All right, that's it. Come here. You are in big trouble young man!
Ross : Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
UNK: You gotta stop doing...
Phoebe : My God!
UNK: - So you guys doing okay? - Yeah.
Chandler : We talked and Monica made me see that I overreacted a little bit.
UNK: - Some things are more important. - Yeah, baby.
UNK: I'm really glad you guys are okay, but I just keep thinking...
UNK: ...what would've happened if you two had hooked up.
UNK: Honey, dinner's ready!
UNK: What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Monica : Your favorite.
Joey : Fried stuff with cheese.
UNK: And lots of it!
UNK: Fat Joey : Thanks, sweetheart.
UNK: Fat Joey : Give me a little sugar...
UNK: Fat Joey : Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
UNK: How you doing?
Monica : Here you go.
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
Phoebe : This is a six-hour pill.
UNK: That's it! I'm out of the woods.
Phoebe : What a relief.
Joey : Good for you.
UNK: It's like a huge weight has been lifted.
UNK: Because, look, no hair loss, no rash, no hives.
UNK: I'm just so happy!
Phoebe : Because, no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria...
