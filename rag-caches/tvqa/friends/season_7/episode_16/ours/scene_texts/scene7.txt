Joey : - This is crazy. - No, Robin is so gay.
UNK: Phoebe, what were you thinking? How could you tell him that?
UNK: I don't know. I'm sorry, it just came out.
UNK: It's a side effect.
Rachel : - So now what have we agreed? - No more pranks.
Rachel : - What else? - You and Daddy were not on a break.
Rachel : Very good.
Ross : Rachel, what are you doing here?
UNK: I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Ross : - Your good friend? - Yeah.
UNK: What's her last name?
UNK: Carol...
UNK: ...Lesbian. - Nice.
UNK: - By the way, that line down my face... - What line?
UNK: "What Line?" The line that prompted a student...
UNK: ...in my last class of the day to say :
UNK: "Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"
UNK: All right I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Rachel : - But you were so mad already. - Of course I was mad.
UNK: I told you I hate this stuff. Okay? It's not funny.
Carol : - Hey, Ross. - Hi.
UNK: - What's not funny? - Practical jokes.
UNK: Well, I think they're funny.
Ross : - You have a line down your face. - What?
Rachel : - Okay, maybe they're not funny to you... - Oh, my God!
Rachel : Or Carol.
UNK: But they're funny to kids. And who is it hurting?
UNK: I'll tell you who it hurts. It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class...
UNK: ...so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt.
Rachel : That was you?
Rachel : We heard about you in junior high.
Rachel : Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged!"
Rachel : I will be!
UNK: I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.
Ross : - Okay? - Fine. Fine.
Rachel : Once I taught him that stuff, he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."
Rachel : And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.
UNK: But I'll go back to being boring and uncomfortable Aunt Rachel.
UNK: No, it's not what I want.
UNK: I'm glad you guys were bonding but...
UNK: Look, he doesn't have any siblings.
UNK: Somebody has to teach him this stuff.
UNK: I haven't taught him anything a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.
Rachel : - Crap! - I gotta go.
Ross : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: You want this scone? It came for me but it would rather sleep with you.
Joey : Nothing even happened.
UNK: - Look, I know you want to do the wedding... - No. If you don't want me to do it...
UNK: ...I accept that. I don't care about that. I just don't want you to be upset.
Chandler : How can I not be upset?
Chandler : I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman...
Chandler : ...and it turns out she wanted you first.
Joey : Yeah, for like a half an hour one night.
Joey : Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life.
UNK: You're so lucky.
Joey : Look what I missed out on by not being there.
Joey : Although, you know what?
UNK: It could never have worked out like you guys did.
UNK: Because you guys are perfect for each other.
UNK: We look at you and we see you together, and it just...
UNK: ...it fits, you know?
