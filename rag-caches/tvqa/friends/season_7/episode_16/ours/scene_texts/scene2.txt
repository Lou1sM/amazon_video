Joey : So did you find anyone to marry you yet?
UNK: No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...
UNK: ...wondering if we're still together.
UNK: - We'll never find anybody. - Then let me do it.
UNK: [scene : - Joey... - I've been thinking.
UNK: I'm an actor, so I won't get nervous in front of people.
UNK: - Joey, please... - No, no, no.
UNK: I won't spit and I won't stare at Monica's breasts.
UNK: Everyone knows I'm an ass man.
UNK: - That's true. - The most important thing...
UNK: ...is, it won't be some stranger who barely knows you.
UNK: It'll be me. And I swear, I'll do a really good job.
UNK: Plus, I love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me.
UNK: - Well, we haven't found anybody else. - Might be kind of cool.
Joey : - So I can do it? - Yeah, you can do it.
Joey : All right! Okay!
Joey : Okay, I gotta get started on my speech.
Joey : Wait a minute.
Joey : Internet ministers can have sex, right?
UNK: - Hey, Pheebs. How's it going? - I have a headache. A horrible headache.
UNK: - I'm sorry. Can I get you something? - Oh, my God, you've got to stop chattering.
Monica : Here, take a couple of these.
Phoebe : - What is it? - It's Hexedrin.
Phoebe : Oh, no, I don't believe in Western medicine.
Phoebe : If you just apply pressure to these points right here...
UNK: Then your hands starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
UNK: While we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch.
UNK: Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head.
UNK: I'm gonna turn the TV on. You can watch whatever you want.
UNK: Sit down. I'm gonna make you some tea, and then I'm gonna rub your feet.
Joey : My head!
UNK: Coming.
Ross : I have a bone to pick with you.
Rachel : - Uh-oh. - Yes.
Ross : Ben learned a little trick.
UNK: - Oh, did he pull the old...? - That's right. That's right.
Ross : Saran wrap on the toilet seat...
Ross : ...so the pee goes everywhere.
Rachel : - Oh, that. - Yeah, that.
Ross : You know I hate practical jokes.
UNK: They're mean, they're stupid and I don't want my son learning them.
Ross : Saran wrap on the toilet seat? Isn't that just a little funny?
Ross : - I was barefoot. - Oh.
UNK: This is exactly what I'm talking about.
UNK: You're not laughing with someone, you're laughing at them.
UNK: And laughing at someone is not nice.
UNK: So you're one of those too.
Ross : Tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him, right?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: It' amazing. My headache is completely gone.
Phoebe : - What were those pills called? - Hexedrin.
UNK: I love you Hexedrin.
Phoebe : Oh, look, it comes with a story.
Monica : Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff.
Phoebe : Say what?
UNK: You know, the possible side effects.
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
UNK: "Dizziness. Nervousness. Drowsiness.
UNK: Facial swelling. Nausea. Headache..."
UNK: Headache.
UNK: "Vomiting. Stomach bleeding. Liver damage."
UNK: I don't recall any of these coming up when you gave me these little death capsules.
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. "Extra strength" death capsules.
UNK: None of that ever happens. They just put it on there for legal reasons.
UNK: Why?
Monica : In case it happens.
Ross : - Hey. - Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.
