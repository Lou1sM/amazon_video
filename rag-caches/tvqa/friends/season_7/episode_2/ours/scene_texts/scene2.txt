Ross : - Hello. - Hi, is Phoebe here?
UNK: - No, she's out for the night. - Oh, great.
Ross : Can I help you with something?
UNK: I don't know. Are you a masseur?
Ross : Yes, I am.
UNK: Great! Dad?
Woman : Thank you so much. I'll pick him up in an hour.
UNK: You need help with that?
UNK: Your parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah. I should probably call them.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I remember when we first got engaged.
UNK: - I've never heard that story. - Dad, you don't...
UNK: Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.
UNK: I still don't know how.
UNK: You don't know how? Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.
Chandler : What a sweet story.
UNK: At least you're not hearing it at your fifth grade Halloween party.
UNK: Mr. Geller : They wanted a scary story.
UNK: We're really excited about our wedding plans.
UNK: I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
Chandler : - What? - You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.
UNK: You have the wedding fund, don't you?
UNK: Mr. Geller : We have it. Only, now we call it "the beach house."
Monica : You spent my wedding fund on the beach house?
UNK: We're sorry. We assumed...
UNK: ...that if you got married after 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
Monica : You bought the beach house when I was 23.
UNK: So you've had seven years of beach fun...
UNK: ...and you can't put a price on that.
UNK: We do feel bad about this.
UNK: We saved again when you dated Richard...
UNK: Mr. Geller : ...then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
UNK: What about Chandler?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : It was Chandler. We didn't think he'd propose.
Chandler : Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
UNK: I can't believe there's no money for my wedding.
UNK: Maybe, if your father hadn't tried...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : ...to sell ice over the Internet.
UNK: Mr. Geller : - It seemed like such a simple idea. - Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.
UNK: Enough. I don't want to hear about it anymore.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Good luck, Chandler.
UNK: Okay, now I'm going to...
Ross : ...touch you.
UNK: That's soft.
UNK: Why does Joey keep talking about chimney sweeps and vicars?
UNK: I thinks he's just been rehearsing for an episode of his show.
UNK: Because it really sounds like a bad porn novel.
UNK: Do you think your parents could help pay for it?
