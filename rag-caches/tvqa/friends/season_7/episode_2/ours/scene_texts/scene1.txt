Monica : Of course you can look at it. I want your opinion.
Monica : Here you go.
UNK: - What about centerpieces? - Centerpieces!
Monica : - Roses or lilies? - Definitely roses.
UNK: I think they're more "wedding-y."
Chandler : - But lilies are the clear choice. - Oh, my God, it's like one mind.
Joey : Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.
UNK: I'm gonna get cranky.
UNK: Joey, there's a perfectly good couch across the hall.
Joey : Yes, it is perfectly good...
Joey : ...and it is not one of the places the duck got sick.
UNK: What?
UNK: - All right, I'm gonna go. - Joey, what did the duck do?
UNK: I don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.
UNK: Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?
Joey : What the hell is in that face cream?
UNK: That's so soft.
UNK: Pillowcases!
UNK: "Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar..."
UNK: Vicar?
UNK: "...wouldn't be home for hours.
Joey : Her loins were burning.
Joey : She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his..."
Joey : This is a dirty book!
UNK: Phoebe?
Phoebe : Oh, Ross, hi.
Ross : - Phoebe, what are you doing? - Sorry, I'm with a client right now.
UNK: [scene : - Phoebe! - Okay, let's talk outside.
UNK: Unfortunately, this time will be counted as part of your massage.
UNK: So try...
UNK: ...and think relaxing thoughts.
UNK: And don't touch any of my dinosaurs.
UNK: I know they're cool, but they're mine.
UNK: Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment.
UNK: I did it at Monica and Chandler's.
Ross : And they knew about it?
UNK: Okay, Ross, what is this really about?
Ross : This is my home and I want to be able to come and go when I want.
Phoebe : I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments.
UNK: I don't know what the big deal is.
UNK: I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment...
Ross : ...when I want to kick back with a puzzle... Beer, cold beer.
UNK: Hey, Joey. What are you doing?
UNK: Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?
UNK: No.
Joey : What if I was sweeping a chimney?
UNK: Joey, did you eat my face cream?
Joey : Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
UNK: Joey, where did you learn that word?
Joey : Where do you think...
UNK: ...Zelda?
Rachel : - You found my book?! - Yeah, I did!
UNK: Joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom?
UNK: I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap. I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
UNK: God! I cannot believe you invaded my privacy like that!
UNK: Zelda.
UNK: Now, you seem a little tense. Maybe you'll relax if I gave you a nice milk bath.
UNK: Okay, you know what?
UNK: - I don't even like that part. - Oh, I do.
UNK: You know what? I don't care. I'm not ashamed of my book.
UNK: There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica.
UNK: It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality...
UNK: ...which, by the way, is something that you will never understand.
Joey : You got porn.
