Phoebe : Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Joey : - Hey, Rach. - Joey.
Joey : Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
Rachel : I get it. Smoke, chimney, chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.
UNK: No, no, I'm serious. You don't smell it?
UNK: Something's on fire.
UNK: No, I don't smell anything.
UNK: Oh, you know what? It's probably just your burning loins.
UNK: - Hey, what are you guys talking about? - Nothing.
UNK: Damn, this coffee's cold.
Ross : Do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
UNK: You know, I cannot believe you told him. Joey...
Ross : So I guess you bought that book after we broke up.
Rachel : Yeah, I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah?
Ross : Well, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines.
UNK: What's up?
Phoebe : Ross, how could you do that to an old man?
Ross : Excuse me, ladies.
UNK: I'm sorry?
Phoebe : My massage client, Arthur.
UNK: His daughter said some guy that worked for me...
Phoebe : ...gave him a really weird massage.
Ross : I gave him an extremely professional massage.
Phoebe : He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
UNK: Okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage.
Ross : But I did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks...
Ross : ...and I gently exfoliated him with a mop.
UNK: Well, he's never coming back. You just cost me $80 a week.
Ross : This is your fault. You didn't move his appointment.
UNK: Oh, it's my fault? You didn't have to massage him.
UNK: You could've sent him away.
UNK: You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back.
Ross : He said he liked that!
UNK: You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Joey : Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
Ross : - His daughter was hot. - Gotcha.
UNK: Look, Ross, I really need that $80 every week.
UNK: I'm sure you'll find another massage client, Phoebe.
UNK: Yeah, I'm sure I will too. But until then, I'm going to massage you every week...
UNK: ...for the price of $ 100. - You just said 80.
UNK: You want me to mess up your puzzle?
UNK: A hundred it is.
Joey : Hello, Zelda.
Rachel : - Who are you supposed to be? - The vicar.
Rachel : - Do you even know what a vicar is? - Like a goalie, right?
UNK: Look, that's enough.
UNK: The joke's over. I'm sick of it.
UNK: You mean this isn't the sweet torment you've been waiting all your life for?
UNK: Joey, I'm serious, all right? It's enough.
UNK: You make stupid jokes and sleazy innuendoes...
UNK: ...and it's just not funny anymore.
UNK: I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
UNK: Maybe I could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn.
UNK: All right, that's it. You wanna do it? Let's do it.
UNK: That's right. I wanna do it with you.
Rachel : Been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Phoebe : I did?
UNK: Yeah. Oh, I've been waiting so long to get on that body.
Joey : - This body? - Yeah, that's right.
UNK: Come on, Joey, sex me up.
UNK: You're starting to sound like the butcher's wife in chapter seven.
UNK: Come on, now. Don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off.
