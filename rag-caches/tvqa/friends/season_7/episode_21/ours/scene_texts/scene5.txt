Chandler : I love you, Monica.
Monica : I love you too, Chandler.
Phoebe : I thought you guys were doing it. I didn't know you were in love.
Joey : So that's it, it's over. Everybody knows.
Monica : - Well, actually, Ross doesn't. - We'd appreciate if no one told him yet.
UNK: No.
Ross : What are you doing?
Ross : Get off my sister!
UNK: Your friends getting married, it's gotta change things.
UNK: You think it'll be that different?
Phoebe : How could it not be? Soon, they're gonna have kids...
UNK: ...and hang out with other couples who have kids.
UNK: And maybe they'll leave the city...
Phoebe : ...to be near a Volvo dealership.
Rachel : Things change.
UNK: But I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership.
UNK: It'll be okay, Joe.
Joey : Sorry. I just... I like things the way they are.
Rachel : Who's this little naked guy?
Ross : That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel : Look at the little thing.
UNK: Yes.
Ross : Yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grownups now?
Chandler : - Who are those people? - Got me.
Monica : That's Nana right there in the middle.
Phoebe : - Wow. - Let's see.
UNK: "Me and the gang at Java Joe's."
UNK: Monica, you look like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica : Let's see, 1939.
Monica : Yeah, 24, 25.
Ross : Looks like a fun gang.
UNK: Look, look, look! I got Monica naked.
UNK: Let me see.
Ross : No, that would be me again.
Phoebe : - Hey, you guys. - What's going on?
UNK: Well, we were just talking about...
UNK: ...you guys getting married and how great it is.
Joey : Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
UNK: That's so sweet.
Chandler : - So we both finished our vows. - Can we read them?
UNK: Just as long as I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
UNK: Oh, that's beautiful.
UNK: Funny one! That's good!
Chandler : Monica, will you marry me?
UNK: What? I don't get it.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah!
Ross : - Man, this is hilarious! - Chandler!
UNK: Don't worry, honey. We'll make yours funnier.
Chandler : Okay, what do you guys think?
Ross : - Dude... - I have never known love like this.
Chandler : - You really like it? - Dude!
Ross : How did you write this?
UNK: I stole Monica's and changed the name.
UNK: - You can't do that! - If he goes first, he can!
