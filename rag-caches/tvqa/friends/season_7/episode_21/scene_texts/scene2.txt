Monica : ...in all my life...
Monica : ...I never thought I would be so lucky...
UNK: ...as to fall in love with my best...
Monica : My best...
UNK: - There's a reason why girls don't do this! - Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.
Chandler : I thought...
Chandler : I can do this.
Chandler : I thought...
Chandler : ...that it mattered what I said or where I said it.
Chandler : Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you...
Chandler : You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
UNK: And if you let me...
Chandler : ...I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.
UNK: Monica?
