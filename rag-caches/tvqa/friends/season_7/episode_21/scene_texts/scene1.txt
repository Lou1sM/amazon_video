Joey : I got it! How about saying something like :
UNK: "Monica, when I look back over our time together..."
Phoebe : - Yeah? - I can't do everything.
Joey : Look back over your time together.
Phoebe : Oh, look, twins!
Monica : No fair! I don't even have one, how come they get two?
Chandler : - You'll get one. - Yeah, when?
Chandler : I'll tell you what.
UNK: When we're 40, if neither of us are married, what do you say you and I have one?
UNK: Why wouldn't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler : Oh, no. No, I just meant hypothetically.
Monica : Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler : No, no.
UNK: What is it? Seriously, is there something fundamentally un-marriable about me?
UNK: Well?
Chandler : Dear God, this parachute is a knapsack!
UNK: I'm getting married today!
UNK: Do you think he knew I was here?
Chandler : Nice try.
UNK: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Chandler : Look, Monica...
UNK: - This is not gonna work. - I bet this will work.
Chandler : You are so great! I love you.
UNK: What?
UNK: Nothing! I said, you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.
UNK: - You said you love me! I can't believe this. - No, I didn't.
Monica : - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't!
Monica : - You love me! - No, I don't!
Chandler : Stop it! Stop it!
UNK: You know, I was thinking, what if I unpack here?
Monica : Then all your stuff would be here.
UNK: Well...
Chandler : What if all my stuff was here?
UNK: Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
UNK: Doesn't make any sense.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying?
