Monica : - Hi. - What have you guys been up to?
Ross : We were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out...
Ross : ...because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Joey : How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass" inappropriate?
UNK: How's Monica doing?
UNK: Let's say it's lucky she's got a sweet ass because she's not so good at the writing.
UNK: I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
UNK: Let's just hope it works.
UNK: Nine out of 10 marriages end in divorce.
UNK: Phoebe, that's not true.
UNK: Yeah, you're right. How's the missus?
UNK: I can't believe they've been together 3 years.
Joey : That long?
UNK: Maybe it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
UNK: Hey, it's me. Coming in.
Chandler : I've had a very long, hard day.
UNK: - I'm gonna get some chicken. Want some? - No, thanks. No, chicken. Bye, then.
UNK: Are you okay? I'm sorry. He wouldn't leave. He kept asking if I wanted chicken.
UNK: Chicken?
Monica : I could eat some chicken.
Chandler : Hey, Joe!
UNK: Can I get a three-piece, some coleslaw and some beans and a Coke?
Chandler : Diet Coke.
UNK: - I don't know why they didn't just tell us. - It's not like we weren't cool about it.
UNK: You? And you?
UNK: You cannot tell. No one knows.
Joey : How? When?
Chandler : - It happened in London. - In London?!
UNK: We didn't tell anyone, because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Joey : But it is a big deal!
Joey : - I have to tell someone. - No, no!
Chandler : - You can't. - Please!
UNK: We don't want to deal with telling everyone. Just promise you won't tell.
Joey : All right!
UNK: I can't wait to be with you. I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a few hours.
UNK: Laundry? Is that my new nickname?
UNK: You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Phoebe : Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler. Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!
Phoebe : Chandler and Monica! Chandler and Monica!
Chandler : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : - Chandler and Monica! - Oh, my God!
Phoebe : - Oh, my eyes! My eyes! - Phoebe! Phoebe!
Rachel : - It's okay! It's okay! - No! They're doing it!
Rachel : I know! I know!
Monica : - You know? - Yes, I know!
Rachel : And Joey knows, but Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop screaming!
UNK: - Hey, what's going on? - Oh, hi!
Phoebe : What? What?
Rachel : Oh, God! We're just so excited that you might get this apartment!
Ross : - Actually, it looks really good. - It looks pretty good!
UNK: Get in here! Come on!
UNK: So they know you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows?
UNK: Yes, but you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what.
Joey : Now enough of us know, that we can just tell them we know.
UNK: Now all the lying and the secrets will finally be over.
Phoebe : Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
UNK: All right, we better go if we're gonna catch that movie.
Chandler : - Bye. - Bye.
UNK: Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
Chandler : Did you see that? With the inappropriate and the pinching?
Monica : Actually, I did.
