Phoebe : What happened, you just drift apart?
UNK: Do you remember our wedding day?
UNK: Did you know I slept with the best man?
UNK: Yes, he told me.
UNK: At least I think that was what he said.
UNK: It was difficult to understand with his legs wrapped around my head.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Here comes the bride.
Phoebe : Oh, my God, Monica!
UNK: I want to wear this every day.
Rachel : You look so beautiful.
UNK: I'm so happy for me.
UNK: Mr. Bing : - Hello? - Did Chandler show up yet?
UNK: - We got him back. Everything's fine. - Damn it!
Ross : - Where are you? - I'm still on the set.
Rachel : The wedding is in less than an hour.
UNK: I know. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk. They won't let me go until we get this.
UNK: Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to find another minister.
UNK: No, I'm the minister!
UNK: Look, put them both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Rachel : Joey, I have to go.
UNK: Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Ross : There you go! You put on a tuxedo!
UNK: That wasn't scary, was it?
UNK: No.
UNK: I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
UNK: What's the next little bit?
Ross : Getting married.
Ross : You can do that too. Just like you've done everything else.
UNK: Yeah, you're right. I can do that.
Chandler : - Excuse me for a minute. - Where you going?
UNK: I'm not gonna run away again. I just want some fresh air.
Ross : - Okay. - Okay.
Chandler : Oh, fresh air!
UNK: - Cover for me. - Maybe you're overreacting. You do that.
Rachel : We gotta do something.
UNK: Joey won't make it, so I'll look around the hotel for other weddings.
UNK: Don't tell them Monica's pregnant, because they frown on that.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding. Excellent.
UNK: Congratulations.
Rachel : Mazel tov.
Rachel : Hi! Oh, great hat.
Rachel : I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
UNK: I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Ross : Yeah. Yeah.
UNK: They're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis.
UNK: And Chandler Acidophilus.
Chandler : Hi. Hi.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Has anyone seen Chandler?
UNK: Mr. Geller : - I thought he was with you. - He was with me.
UNK: We're playing a little game. Hide-and-seek.
UNK: You can't ask us, son. That's cheating.
UNK: You're right. Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.
UNK: He better not come here. He can't see the bride in her wedding dress.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : As I recall, when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
UNK: Mr. Bing : That was after the wedding. It's not bad luck then.
UNK: Honey, it isn't good luck.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! Monica.
Joey : I know!
UNK: - How's Chandler doing? - Great.
UNK: He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Monica : Are you okay?
