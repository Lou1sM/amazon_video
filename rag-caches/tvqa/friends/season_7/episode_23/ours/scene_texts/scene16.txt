Joey : Aaron, you gotta let me go. The guy's hammered.
UNK: I'm sorry. As long as he's here and conscious, we're still shooting.
UNK: You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
UNK: So I just talked to the director.
UNK: That's it. We're done for the day.
Richard : We finished the scene?
Joey : - You were wonderful. - As were you.
UNK: So I got your car. It's right outside.
Richard : Why? Are we done for the day?
UNK: That's what you told me.
UNK: Thank you. You're welcome.
Joey : No, we gotta go. Come on. Here we go.
Richard : Is that my ass?
Ross : - There he is! - What?
UNK: You're not getting away this time, mister!
Ross : Unless you want that ass-kicking we talked about!
UNK: Ross!
UNK: I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
UNK: That's right. I'm not.
UNK: - Then where have you been? - I know about Monica.
Ross : - You know? - What?
Chandler : I heard you and Rachel talking.
Ross : - What? Talking about what? - You don't know?
UNK: If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
UNK: What, you'll "hi-yah"?
UNK: Monica's pregnant.
Chandler : Oh, my God.
Chandler : Oh, my God. And you're not freaking out?
UNK: I was. Then I went to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes.
Chandler : - Cigarettes? - Big picture, please!
UNK: So when I was in the gift shop, that's when I saw this.
UNK: And I thought, "Anything that can fit into this can't be scary."
UNK: You obviously didn't see Chucky III.
Chandler : But come on, look at how cute and small this is.
Chandler : So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
UNK: Dude.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Way to go, son. I knew you'd find him.
UNK: Mr. Bing : Our little boy is getting married.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : Look at you, so handsome.
Chandler : You look beautiful, Mom.
