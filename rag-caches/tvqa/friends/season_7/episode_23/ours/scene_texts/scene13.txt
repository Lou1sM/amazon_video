Richard : Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Joey : Look, my best friends are getting married in, like, an hour, okay?
UNK: And I'm the minister. Please, can you pull it together?
UNK: Of course. I'm sorry. I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me.
Richard : - I can do this. - Thank you. Thank you.
UNK: Still rolling. And, action.
Joey : I would sooner die in this hellhole than see her back with you!
Richard : That can be arranged!
Richard : Slippery little bugger!
Phoebe : So you two were married, huh?
