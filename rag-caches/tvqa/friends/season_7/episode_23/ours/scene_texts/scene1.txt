UNK: Richard, we're ready for you.
UNK: The Assistant Director : Joey Tribbiani, this is Richard Crosby. He's playing Vincent.
UNK: - I'm acting with you? - Nice to meet you.
UNK: I can't believe this. This is incredible. You just won an Oscar.
UNK: No, I didn't.
Joey : I think you did.
Richard : I think I lost, three times.
UNK: - Cookie? Would you...? - No.
UNK: We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit.
UNK: - Can you guys run it a couple times? - Yeah, sure.
UNK: All right. Let's do it.
UNK: And... Action!
UNK: - We have to find the platoon! - Forget it, the platoon is gone!
Phoebe : - What? - The platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!
UNK: What'll we do? We have no reinforcements or food.
UNK: There's food in the basement. Potatoes and some pasta.
UNK: The Director : Hang on. Joey, you keep touching your face.
UNK: The Director : Something wrong?
Joey : No. No.
Joey : I thought it might be a cool character thing.
UNK: He's a face toucher.
UNK: I don't think so.
UNK: Let's take it back to Richard's last lines. Action!
UNK: We may not have weapons, but we still have food.
