UNK: Do you realize this is the last time we'll be here...
Monica : ...as six single people?
UNK: What's happening to the coffeehouse?
UNK: From now on, it's you four and me and the missus.
Chandler : The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Chandler : - Old? - The young, hot ball and chain.
Monica : - Much better. - We gotta go.
Ross : - Where? - Get the dress and lunch with Mom.
UNK: Joey, you too?
UNK: I just heard "lunch."
Joey : Yeah, I can go. Sure.
UNK: Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.
Ross : I need to talk to you about something.
UNK: - What's up? - This may be a little awkward.
UNK: If you need money, it's a bad time. I'm buying 128 dinners tomorrow.
UNK: No, it's not that.
UNK: I'm not gonna say this as your friend...
UNK: ...but as Monica's older brother.
UNK: - But you're still my friend? - Not for a few minutes.
UNK: - Right now, are you still my best man? - No.
Chandler : Do I still call you Ross?
Ross : You guys are getting married, and I couldn't be more thrilled.
UNK: But as her older brother, I have to tell you this :
Ross : If you ever hurt my little sister...
Ross : ...if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind...
Ross : ...I will hunt you down...
Ross : ...and kick your ass.
UNK: What? I'm serious.
UNK: - Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding. - I hear what you're saying...
Chandler : ...and thanks for the warning.
Ross : No problem.
UNK: Are we friends again?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: You won't believe what Monica's brother just said to me!
UNK: The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding
Phoebe : - What are they? - So far, the dresses won't get picked up...
Monica : ...my veil gets lost or I don't have something blue.
UNK: I'm responsible for all those.
Monica : I had to go with the odds.
Joey : Remember that audition I had a while ago and I didn't get the part?
Rachel : - The commercial? - That play?
Monica : That other play?
Phoebe : - The movie? - Yes!
UNK: The one about the dog who flies planes?
UNK: No. But, man, that one hurt.
UNK: - This is the one about WWI soldiers. - Oh, yeah.
UNK: Back then we called it "The Great War."
Phoebe : It really was.
Joey : The guy they wanted backed out! I start shooting today!
UNK: Congratulations!
UNK: - Today's the rehearsal dinner. - I'll be done by then.
UNK: Oh. Then way to go, you big movie star!
UNK: See you. I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Rachel : Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis in WWll, not WWI.
UNK: Who was in WWI?
Phoebe : Go ahead.
UNK: You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
UNK: Who did we fight in WWI?
Rachel : - Mexico? - Yes. Very good.
UNK: - Hey, Joey. We're ready. - Yeah, me too.
