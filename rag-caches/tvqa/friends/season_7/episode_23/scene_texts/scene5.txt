UNK: How cool is it that the next time you see Chandler you'll be walking down the aisle?
UNK: I can't believe that after tomorrow it's all gonna be over.
UNK: Honey, it's not gonna be over. You're gonna be married to Chandler.
UNK: Maybe I can wear the dress for Halloween!
UNK: I'm gonna steam my dress.
UNK: Who will make sure nothing happens to it?
UNK: - I'll do it. - Who wants it? Anybody?
UNK: - I said, I'll do it. - Nobody?
UNK: - All right, I'll do it myself. - I'm not gonna screw it up.
UNK: You're right. I'm sorry. You were a big help tonight.
UNK: Thanks for helping my grandmother get to the hotel safely.
UNK: - Of course! That's what I'm here for. - Okay. Sorry.
Rachel : What grandmother?
Joey : - Where have you been? - Taking my parents to the hotel.
Ross : - Going back to work? - Yeah.
Ross : - Nice shades. - Thanks.
Joey : I figure if I wear these in my scenes, I won't get spit in my eyes.
Ross : And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban was the official sponsor of WWI.
Joey : Great! All right!
UNK: - I'll see you later. - All right.
UNK: - Where's Chandler? - I think he's in Rachel's room.
UNK: Chandler?
Ross : - Is Monica here? - She's steaming her dress. Why?
UNK: - I think Chandler's gone. - What?
Ross : - He left that. - "Tell Monica I'm sorry."
Chandler : Oh, my God.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: "Tell Monica I'm sorry."
Phoebe : Tell her yourself.
Chandler : Oh, my God. Chandler just left, though?
UNK: Maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's :
UNK: "Tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk."
UNK: Or "Tell Monica I'm sorry I used her tweezers to pluck my nose hair."
UNK: He does that. I've seen him.
UNK: Or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name :
UNK: "Tell Monica I'm Sorry."
Ross : - It means he freaked out and left! - Don't be so negative!
UNK: Good God, isn't it possible that "Sorry" is sitting in there right now?
UNK: Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
UNK: I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back.
Ross : You make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
UNK: But if you don't find him and bring him back...
Phoebe : ...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Ross : I will find him.
UNK: Well, the dress is done.
UNK: What?
UNK: We're just so happy for you.
UNK: That's so sweet!
UNK: Can we just take a minute and talk about the man I'm gonna marry tomorrow.
UNK: I mean, how lucky am I?
UNK: That's a good question.
UNK: I just hope that someday you guys find someone like Chandler.
UNK: I hope we find someone exactly like Chandler and soon.
UNK: Joey? Can you go through these lines with me?
