UNK: Monica.
Ross : So you know, I had my "older brother" talk with Chandler.
Monica : What is that?
Ross : I told him that if he ever hurt you...
Ross : ...I would hunt him down and kick his ass.
Ross : What is the matter with everybody? I'm serious.
Ross : I would kick his ass!
Phoebe : Ross, please, my makeup!
Ross : - Chandler. - Mom.
Chandler : Thanks for wearing... something.
UNK: Mrs. Bing : This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up too much for this.
UNK: Just think, soon there will be lots of little Bings.
UNK: I can't believe I'm going back to work to get spit on again.
UNK: You're lucky. At least the people that spit on you are famous.
UNK: - Who spits on you? - I don't want to talk about work.
UNK: Mrs. Bing? These are my parents, Judy and Jack Geller.
UNK: - It's lovely to meet you. - Are you his mother or father?
UNK: Jack!
UNK: What? I've never seen one before.
UNK: Dad, there's Ross. Go talk to him.
UNK: I wasn't even able to act like I'm okay with it.
UNK: Mr. Bing : Hello, all.
UNK: Hi... Dad.
UNK: Hi, Mr. Bing.
UNK: Mr. Bing : - Nora. - Charles.
UNK: - It's so great to see you both here. - Yes.
UNK: Although we may be seeing too much of some people.
UNK: Aren't you a little old to wear a dress like that?
UNK: Don't you have a little too much penis to wear a dress like that?
Chandler : Oh, my God.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Of course you can kick his ass, son.
UNK: You could kick anyone's ass you want to.
Ross : Thanks, you guys.
Monica : - Rach, Rach? - Yeah?
UNK: Talk to Chandler's dad and keep him away from Chandler's mom.
UNK: - But I don't know what he looks like. - He's the man in the black dress.
UNK: Hi! I'm Rachel, a friend of Monica and Chandler's.
UNK: - I'm Amanda. - Oh, I get it.
UNK: "A man, duh!"
UNK: Could I have your attention?
UNK: - I'm Ross Geller. - Dr. Ross Geller.
Ross : Dad, please. As I was saying...
UNK: ...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
UNK: And I'm the best man.
UNK: And I have to say, I'm a little surprised we're all here today.
UNK: For those of you who don't know Chandler...
UNK: ...he's not the biggest fan of relationships.
UNK: In fact, I think before he met Monica...
UNK: ...the only real relationship he had was with a girl named Molly.
UNK: And he would've married her, only she couldn't control her bladder.
UNK: It was his dog. Did I say it was his dog?
UNK: Any... Anyway...
Ross : This marriage is doubly special for me...
Ross : ...because not only is the groom my best friend...
Ross : ...but the bride is my little sister.
UNK: She's the greatest sister a guy could ask for.
Ross : Please join me in raising a glass...
UNK: ...to the couple we're here to celebrate.
Ross : - To the Bings. - To the Bings!
