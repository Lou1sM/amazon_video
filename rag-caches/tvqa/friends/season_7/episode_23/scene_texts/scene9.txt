UNK: But they found the grandmother wandering down 5th Avenue.
UNK: Okay, well, there's one down.
UNK: I'm getting married today!
UNK: I cracked a rib, but I don't care. Today's my wedding!
Monica : My day is finally here!
UNK: She might not even notice he's gone.
UNK: I'm gonna start getting ready!
UNK: We can't let her start getting ready. This is too awful!
UNK: But she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up...
UNK: ...then she'll have to take off the gown...
UNK: Stop it. You can't do this here.
UNK: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
UNK: It's just so sad.
Joey : Pull it together. She can't see you like this.
UNK: - She'll know something's wrong. - I know. I know. Oh, God!
UNK: There's no tissue.
Rachel : Can you grab me some toilet paper?
UNK: Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom, right?
Phoebe : - I found one. - Okay.
Ross : - Here you go. - Thank you.
Rachel : Oh, God.
Rachel : Can I have another one?
UNK: Sure.
Phoebe : Do you need some floss?
UNK: I can't imagine what will happen if he doesn't show up.
UNK: Here's a whole bunch.
UNK: She'll be at the wedding waiting...
Rachel : ...and people will be whispering, "Oh, that poor girl."
UNK: Then she'll have to come back here and live alone.
Chandler : - Oh, my God. - What?
Phoebe : There was a pregnancy test in the garbage. And it's positive.
UNK: Monica's pregnant.
UNK: So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!
UNK: Can this count as her "something new"?
Chandler : Oh, my God.
Phoebe : Do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Rachel : She had to have just taken that test. I took out the trash last night.
UNK: It's turning into the worst wedding ever.
UNK: The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and I'm still holding this.
Rachel : Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.
Phoebe : - Right. Yeah. - Okay?
Phoebe : Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she uses?
Rachel : No. Why?
Phoebe : Just for the future. This is hardly a commercial for it.
UNK: Anything?
Ross : No. I talked to Joey on the set. He hasn't heard from him.
UNK: I talked to Chandler's parents again.
UNK: You said he was missing?
Ross : No. I made it seem like I called to chat.
Ross : Pretty sure they both think I'm interested in them.
