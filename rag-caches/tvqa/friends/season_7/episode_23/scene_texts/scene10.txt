UNK: - We've got to tell her he's gone. - No, we can't.
UNK: She'll start getting ready soon.
UNK: Can't you stall her? I'll go back to the places I went last night.
Rachel : How much time?
UNK: How long before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Rachel : - One hour. - Give me two.
Rachel : Then why do you ask?
Ross : - Wish me luck. - I'm going with you.
UNK: Why?
UNK: You're tired. You looked all night. And, clearly, you suck at this.
UNK: I have documented night blindness.
UNK: No, you don't!
UNK: Okay. But I don't suck!
Joey : See you later.
Phoebe : Do you know how you're gonna stall her?
UNK: Because she is insane about her schedule today.
UNK: - I'll figure something out. - Okay, good luck.
UNK: I thought we'd start with my makeup and then do my hair.
Rachel : Okay. But before you do that, I need you to talk to me.
Monica : About what?
UNK: I'm never gonna get married!
UNK: You will. The right guy's just around the corner.
Monica : Okay, are we done with that?
UNK: No, I'm serious.
Rachel : Maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
UNK: Any woman would be lucky to have you.
UNK: Maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Joey.
UNK: Rachel? Are you okay?
UNK: Excuse me, Aaron? I have a little problem with the schedule.
UNK: I wasn't supposed to work today. I have a wedding that I have to be at.
UNK: It's my best friend's and I'm officiating...
UNK: ...so I really can't work past 4.
UNK: You've gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you.
UNK: It's not like it's your wedding.
UNK: It is my wedding.
UNK: Did I not make that clear?
UNK: You said your best friend is getting married.
UNK: Yeah, to me.
UNK: Yeah, I'm marrying my best friend. Isn't that beautiful?
UNK: - But you said you were officiating. - Yeah.
UNK: - Your own wedding? - Happens more than you think.
UNK: I'm sorry, Joey. It's still no.
UNK: I'm having surgery.
UNK: What?
UNK: I made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry.
UNK: But I'm having surgery today.
UNK: The Director : What kind of surgery?
UNK: Transplant.
UNK: But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Joey : Hair transplant.
UNK: But you're not bald.
UNK: It's not on my head.
UNK: There's nothing I can do. You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.
UNK: We've just got one short scene, it's just you and Richard and he's a pro.
UNK: You'll be fine.
UNK: The Director : Morning, Richard.
UNK: Hey, you're here! Great! Let's go, buddy!
UNK: We got a scene to shoot!
UNK: I'm wearing two belts.
Joey : - Are you drunk? - No.
Joey : Yes, you are!
Joey : All right.
Ross : We are never gonna find him. He's one guy in a huge city.
