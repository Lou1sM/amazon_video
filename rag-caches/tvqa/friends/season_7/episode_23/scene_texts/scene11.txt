Phoebe : Oh, my God. Is that him?
Ross : That is an old Chinese woman.
UNK: He could be in disguise, you know.
UNK: You know what? You're right. You're absolutely right.
Chandler : Wait a minute.
UNK: Chandler!
UNK: Now you're thinking.
UNK: Maybe we're just approaching this all wrong.
UNK: If you're Chandler and you want to hide...
Ross : ...where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
Ross : So this is your office.
UNK: How'd you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym.
Phoebe : - What the hell are you doing? - Panicking.
Chandler : And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.
Chandler : - How is she? - She doesn't know you're gone.
UNK: And she doesn't have to know. Come on, we're going home.
UNK: - I can't do that. - Why not?
Chandler : Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.
UNK: I can't be the Bings.
UNK: What's wrong with it?
Chandler : The Bings have horrible marriages.
Chandler : They yell, they fight...
Chandler : ...and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games.
UNK: Have you ever put on a black dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Chandler : - No. - Then you are neither of your parents.
UNK: It's not just their marriage. Look at yours. Look at everybody's.
UNK: Only Paul Newman can make marriage work.
UNK: And I've met me. I am no Paul Newman.
UNK: I don't race cars or make popcorn. None of my proceeds go to charity.
Phoebe : But look, Chandler...
UNK: ...right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do.
Phoebe : But I totally believe you can do this.
Chandler : I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afraid...
UNK: This is too huge.
UNK: You're right. It is huge.
UNK: So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time.
Ross : Forget getting married for a sec. Just forget about it.
Ross : Can you just come home and take a shower?
Chandler : Well, yeah. But then...
UNK: We're just gonna go home and take a shower.
UNK: That's not scary, right?
UNK: Depends on what you mean by "we."
Joey : - All right! - There he is!
UNK: Good old Chandler with the homophobic jokes.
UNK: So, what do you say?
UNK: I'll shower, but I won't promise anything.
UNK: Okay, that's all we're talking about. Okay? Come on, let's go home.
UNK: Who's Mike Smith?
UNK: I was sure this was my office.
Rachel : The nights are the hardest.
Rachel : But then the day comes...
UNK: ...and that's every bit as hard as the night.
Rachel : - Then the night comes again... - The days and nights are hard, I get it!
Monica : I have to start getting ready. I'm getting married today.
Rachel : I know. At dusk.
UNK: That's such a hard time for me.
UNK: I'm gonna put my makeup on. We have to be at the hotel in an hour.
Monica : - Wait! - What?
UNK: Let's go to lunch!
UNK: I can't go to lunch!
UNK: Right.
UNK: Oh, good God, I've fallen down.
UNK: What's going on?
UNK: All right, honey, listen.
UNK: When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember...
