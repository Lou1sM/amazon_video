Chandler : You look beautiful.
Chandler : - Is this new? - Not now.
UNK: - Who's this? - I'm Father Karabasos.
UNK: He's Greek Orthodox.
Richard : As are you.
UNK: The Rabbi : Let us begin.
UNK: The Rabbi : Dearly beloved...
UNK: That's my line!
Joey : I can take it from here. Thanks.
UNK: The Rabbi : Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late.
Joey : You may be confused by this now...
UNK: ...but you won't be Memorial Day weekend, 2002.
UNK: Let's get started before the groom takes off again.
Joey : We are gathered here today...
Joey : ...to join this man...
Joey : ...and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
UNK: I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I cannot imagine...
Joey : ...two people more perfect for each other.
UNK: And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room...
Joey : ...we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Monica : - He took off? - Go on. Go on.
Monica : Chandler, for so long...
Monica : ...I wondered if I would ever find my prince.
Monica : My soul mate.
Monica : Then three years ago, at another wedding...
Monica : ...I turned to a friend for comfort.
Monica : And instead I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life.
Joey : And now...
Monica : ...here we are...
Monica : ...with our future before us.
Monica : And I only want to spend it with you.
Monica : My prince.
Monica : My soul mate.
Chandler : My friend.
UNK: Unless you don't want to.
Monica : You go.
UNK: Chandler?
UNK: No, that's okay.
UNK: I thought this would be the most difficult thing I ever had to do.
Chandler : But when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized it's simple.
Chandler : I love you.
Chandler : Any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because I will always love you.
Chandler : You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.
UNK: You want to know if I'm sure?
UNK: You may now kiss the bride.
Joey : I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York...
Joey : ...and the Internet guys...
Joey : ...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Joey : Oh, wait. Do you take each other?
Monica : - I do. - I do.
Joey : Yeah, you do!
UNK: Rings.
UNK: Oh, crap. Okay.
UNK: Let's do the rings.
Joey : We good? Yeah? Good?
Joey : Once again...
Joey : ...I pronounce you husband and wife.
Joey : Now kiss her again.
Chandler : I love you.
Chandler : And I know about the baby.
Monica : - What baby? - Our baby.
Monica : We have a baby?
Chandler : Phoebe found your pregnancy test.
UNK: I didn't take a pregnancy test.
UNK: Then who did?
UNK: Look at them.
UNK: And they're gonna have a baby.
