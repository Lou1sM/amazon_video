UNK: Potatoes, pasta...
Richard : ...and a few tins of tuna!
Monica : Honey, we gotta go!
UNK: Here's a question you never want to ask :
UNK: Can my dad borrow one of your pearl necklaces?
UNK: Did he say what kind of neckline he's wearing?
UNK: No.
UNK: I just met him once, but I'm guessing...
UNK: ...plunging?
UNK: He is more of a if-you've-got-it- flaunt-it kind of father.
UNK: Let me see if Rachel has anything.
Chandler : Yes, include more people in this.
Monica : Do you realize that at this time tomorrow we're gonna be getting married?
Chandler : I have a date tomorrow night.
UNK: - I can't believe we made it. - Don't sound so surprised.
UNK: I'm sorry, but...
Monica : - Nothing. - What?
UNK: Well, honestly? Ever since we got engaged...
UNK: ...I've been waiting for something to flip you out.
Chandler : Honestly? Me too.
Phoebe : - Really? - Yeah.
UNK: I think that something will come up and I'll go all...
UNK: Well, Chandler.
Chandler : - But nothing has. - I'm so glad.
UNK: Thank you for staying so calm during this.
UNK: It's made me stay calm.
UNK: I could've been worse.
UNK: I'll be right there.
UNK: If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler.
UNK: But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.
Monica : Please leave a message for... the Bings!
