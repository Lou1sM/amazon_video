Rachel : All right, back to work.
UNK: Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?
UNK: I don't want to be known as the office bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.
UNK: Great, that's great, Monica. Great.
UNK: The Photographer : Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: - I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? - No, I am.
UNK: Chandler, I know you can do this. You have a beautiful smile.
Chandler : - I do? - Yeah.
UNK: Maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else.
Monica : - Try looking sexy. - Okay.
Monica : Or not.
Rachel : Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?
UNK: I got an audition down the street, and I spilled sauce on my shirt.
Joey : - You got an extra one? - Yeah, sure.
UNK: Here.
UNK: Great.
UNK: You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
UNK: Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.
Joey : I guess this'll be fine.
Rachel : - What are you doing tonight? - Nothing. Why?
Rachel : How would you feel about taking out my assistant, Tag? I'll pay.
UNK: It's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
UNK: I'm not asking you to go on a date with him.
UNK: Really? Because I could kind of use the money.
UNK: He's new in town, and I know he doesn't have any guy friends.
UNK: Take him to a ball game or something. I'd really appreciate it.
UNK: - Yeah, okay, no problem. - Thank you.
UNK: Ooh, hey, doughnuts!
UNK: You got a red shirt?
UNK: I know. Let's try a look...
UNK: ...of far-off wonderment.
UNK: Gaze into our future, and think about our marriage and the days to come.
Monica : Chandler, what is the matter with your face?
UNK: This picture should say, "Geller and Bing to be married,"...
Monica : ...not, "Local woman saves drowning moron."
UNK: Hey, don't laugh at him. He's my drowning moron.
UNK: That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!
Ross : I like this one.
Ross : It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
UNK: Can't all be bad.
Monica : Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.
Monica : There it is.
Phoebe : Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes?
Chandler : Why did you ever sleep with me?
Monica : Do you really want to pull at that thread?
UNK: - I'm really having a good time. - Me too.
UNK: Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.
UNK: No, that's okay. He's a friend.
UNK: I don't mean to be presumptuous...
UNK: ...but I have tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.
Chandler : Yeah, I...
UNK: Well, I missed the semifinals, so I think I would just be lost.
UNK: I know that it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss...
Kyle : Oh, no, no, no, my God!
UNK: Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
UNK: It's my ex-wife, Whitney.
UNK: I cannot deal with her now. That woman is crazy.
