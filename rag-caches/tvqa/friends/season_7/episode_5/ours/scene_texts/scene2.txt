Phoebe : Okay, I know. Hold on.
Phoebe : - Hey, Ross. - Yeah.
UNK: That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife, out there.
UNK: Do you think you could divert her so we could slip out?
Ross : What? No.
Phoebe : Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.
UNK: I don't think so, Pheebs.
UNK: All right, I'll do it.
UNK: - But just because you're a friend. - Okay.
Phoebe : Hi, Ginger.
Ross : I want my key back.
UNK: - I don't have it. - It's right there.
Phoebe : Okay, Sherlock.
UNK: I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.
UNK: I just wanted to thank you, though, for diverting Kyle's ex.
UNK: You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Ross : - Hi, Whitney. - Hi, Ross.
UNK: - Are you ready for breakfast? - Yep.
UNK: Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her.
Ross : Can you give me a second while I talk to this woman...
Ross : ...who, by the way, did not spend the night?
Rachel : - Sure. - Okay.
Ross : I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?
Phoebe : Watching ballroom dancing?
UNK: Yes, that's where we realized we were both super-cool people.
UNK: Look, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Ross : - Like what? - Like she's really mean...
UNK: ...and she's overly critical and...
Phoebe : She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : And she uses sex as a weapon.
Ross : Thank you for warning me.
UNK: At breakfast, I'll be on alert for room painting and sex weapons.
UNK: - You're still gonna go out with her? - Yeah.
UNK: Well, didn't you hear what I just said?
Ross : Pheebs, come on. I mean, consider the source.
UNK: Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Phoebe : Listen to me, she is crazy!
UNK: Your door isn't soundproof.
Phoebe : You see? Nothing is good enough for her.
Ross : - Excuse me. - He's not here!
UNK: My God, do you people have nothing better to do...
UNK: ...than to traipse into my office and just gawk at my assistant.
UNK: I'm Emily from upstairs.
UNK: Susan's still in the hospital, and I'm collecting money to send her flowers.
UNK: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Okay. Yes, of course.
UNK: Just take it all. Take it all. And please, please, give my best to Emily.
UNK: I'm Emily.
UNK: Yeah. No, I meant...
UNK: ...the other one that you said.
