UNK: Someone I can spoil, you know.
UNK: Spoil?
Tag : Let me ask you something.
UNK: Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone?
UNK: I'm starting to.
UNK: If that person's in your life, should you do something about it?
Rachel : Yes. Hell, yes.
UNK: All right, then, it's settled.
UNK: - I'm getting back together with my ex. - I would love to!
UNK: What?
UNK: Hello?
Rachel : This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Yeah.
Phoebe : My God!
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?
UNK: And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
UNK: Maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed...
Ross : ...if someone else knew where everything was.
Phoebe : Oh, he knows.
Phoebe : For the most part.
Kyle : Oh, hey. Good, you're both here.
UNK: We kind of need to talk.
Phoebe : - Both of you, together? - What's up?
UNK: Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things...
Whitney : ...and we got to reminiscing.
UNK: We talked most of the night...
UNK: ...and realized the reason we're angry with each other...
UNK: ...is because there are still feelings there.
UNK: So...
Ross : Oh, just say it, Kyle!
UNK: We're gonna try again.
Phoebe : What about her whining, and her constant need for attention?
UNK: I'm gonna work on that.
UNK: Right, because you're so capable of change.
UNK: You know, he hums when he pees.
Whitney : - I do know. - Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
UNK: We're so sorry.
UNK: That's all right. We don't need you. I'm over it already.
UNK: Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.
UNK: Yeah, we're gonna go.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: Pheebs, you were right about her.
UNK: You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.
Ross : Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
UNK: You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.
Ross : We're better off without them.
UNK: Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.
UNK: - Divorced men's club. - Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
UNK: You know, Pheebs, we don't talk that much anymore.
UNK: Yeah.
Monica : Hey, guys, check it out.
Monica : - My mom sent me the paper. - Let's see it.
Chandler : - Oh, yeah, that looks good. - You make a very attractive couple.
Joey : - Yeah, we look great together. - We really do.
UNK: Okay.
Monica : Imagine what our kids would look like.
UNK: We don't have to imagine.
UNK: I'm marrying her.
UNK: We'll just see.
