Tag : - Morning. - Hi, Tag.
UNK: - Did you have fun with Joey last night? - Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
UNK: That's nice.
UNK: Then we went to a bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.
Rachel : Women? You mean, like old women?
UNK: Kind of old, like 30.
Tag : I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars...
Tag : ...but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
UNK: That's great.
UNK: Joey must have really taught you some stuff.
Rachel : A little.
UNK: How you doing?
UNK: See? That's a great smile. Easy, natural.
Joey : Now pretend I have a camera.
UNK: - You're changing it. - I can't help it.
Chandler : Borrow money from me?
UNK: Yeah. Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.
UNK: So here's what I do. I look down, look down, keep looking down.
Joey : Then I look up.
UNK: See? Now you try.
UNK: Look down. You're looking down. Keep looking down.
Chandler : Why is there jelly on your shoe?
UNK: I had a doughnut.
UNK: So I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
UNK: Yeah, that guy's all right.
Rachel : Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey."
Monica : - What? - You know, all the women.
UNK: You can't teach someone to be good with women.
UNK: That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
UNK: I'm right here.
Rachel : Would you mind just not going out with him again?
Rachel : Just the idea of you, and he, and all these women...
UNK: I know he's my assistant, and I can't date him!
Rachel : But it just bothers me, all right?
UNK: No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.
Joey : I got a great partner to pick up girls with. Finally!
UNK: I'm still right here.
UNK: Will you at least talk to him...
UNK: ...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
UNK: What?
UNK: I just don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.
Rachel : And I will get over it.
UNK: It's not like I love him. It's just physical.
Rachel : I get crushes like this all the time. I had a crush on you at first.
Joey : I know. Monica told me.
Chandler : Did you have a crush on me when we first met?
Rachel : Yeah, sure.
Chandler : Can you people not see me?
Rachel : Will you talk to him?
UNK: - I don't know, Rach. - I'll give you 10 free Ralph Lauren shirts.
UNK: One.
UNK: No, 10. You said 10. You can't take that back.
Tag : You wanted to talk to me?
UNK: I don't know. You got something for me?
Tag : Yeah, this is from Rachel.
Joey : Ten. Okay.
UNK: Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.
Rachel : - Really? - Yeah, for you.
UNK: Hey, how much would it cost to get a big fan in here?
Monica : - Hey, there you are. - There I am.
Monica : - You okay? - Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.
Chandler : So he gave me an antihistamine.
UNK: What?
Chandler : I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.
UNK: Brooklyn is far.
