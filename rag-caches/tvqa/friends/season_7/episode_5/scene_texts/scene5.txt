Ross : Listen, you are hearing one side of the story. Okay?
UNK: FYI, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples...
Ross : ...before she painted that room.
Ross : And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
UNK: Maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating...
Phoebe : ...and a little more time in the bedroom.
UNK: I don't think we are going to have that problem...
UNK: ...but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable.
UNK: You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Ross : I think he can be.
UNK: Maybe he wouldn't be...
UNK: ...if she didn't bring the office home every night.
Ross : Excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.
Phoebe : Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve, 1997.
UNK: I knew you were going to throw that in my face!
Ross : That was three years ago. She apologized and apologized.
Ross : What more do you want?
Phoebe : We want the last six years back!
Ross : So do we! So do we!
UNK: I'm sorry you had to see that.
