UNK: Bye-bye.
Chandler : I just got us reservations at Michelle's...
UNK: ...and tickets to The Music Man to celebrate...
Chandler : ...our first holiday season as a betrothed couple.
UNK: - "Betrothed." - Betrothed couple.
Phoebe : - Hey! - Hi!
UNK: Pheebs?
UNK: Skull?
Phoebe : Yeah, it's my mom's.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: No, no, no. It's not my mom.
UNK: It belonged to my mom.
Phoebe : She used to put it out every Christmas...
Phoebe : ...to remind us that even though it's Christmas, people still die.
Phoebe : And you can put candy in it.
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: Licorice?
UNK: Sure.
Ross : - I get Ben for the holidays this year. - That's great!
Monica : - Are you gonna dress up as Santa? - Nope.
Ross : I mean, I know Susan does every year...
UNK: ...but I want to take this year to teach him about Hanukkah.
Phoebe : And maybe I could teach Ben...
Phoebe : ...about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Rachel : You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
UNK: Hey.
Rachel : - Did you know he was in there? - No.
Chandler : - How long have we been home? - About half an hour.
UNK: Lovely.
UNK: The One With The Holiday Armadillo
Chandler : Why not?
UNK: "Bing" is weird.
UNK: Yeah, I know what you mean. Gellar!
Phoebe : Oh, hey, you guys.
Phoebe : Guess what. My landlord just called. My apartment's gonna be ready soon.
Phoebe : So I guess I'll be moving out.
Monica : Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.
Phoebe : Yes, you will be very sad.
Phoebe : - I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. - You guys are gonna live together again?
Phoebe : - Yeah, why not? - She's just having so much fun with Joey...
Chandler : ...I just assumed she'd still be living with him.
Phoebe : Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?
UNK: No reason, except she...
Rachel : ...told me.
UNK: Really? She said she didn't want to live with me?
Chandler : No. No, she didn't say that.
Chandler : I think you should talk to Monica now.
UNK: Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Phoebe : You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
UNK: No, but I'll bet she probably does.
UNK: Oh, probably?
Phoebe : I don't like that word.
UNK: I know what "probably" really means. Yeah, yeah.
UNK: "Oh, your mom probably won't kill herself."
UNK: You know, "No, the funeral director probably won't hit on you."
UNK: "Yeah, that nice couple probably will adopt you. " Okay, I'm sorry.
Phoebe : I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes...
Phoebe : ...of Rachel and I living together on "probably."
UNK: You gotta take care of yourself in this world.
Phoebe : History teaches us nothing.
UNK: "Bing" doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
