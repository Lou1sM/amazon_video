Monica : - Santa! - Hey!
Ross : What are you doing here, Santa?
Chandler : Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.
Ross : What are you doing here...
UNK: ...Weird Turtle Man?
Ross : I'm the Holiday Armadillo...
Ross : ...your part-Jewish friend.
Ross : You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
UNK: Remember?
UNK: What?
Ben : Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
Chandler : You bet I did, Ben.
UNK: Put her there.
Chandler : Well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small.
Chandler : Ho, ho, ho!
Monica : Ben, why don't you come open more presents.
Monica : Santa, the armadillo and I will have a talk in the kitchen.
Monica : There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.
Ross : What are you doing?
Chandler : You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume...
Chandler : ...so I borrowed one from a guy at work.
UNK: Thank you, but you gotta leave.
Chandler : - Why? - Because...
Ross : ...I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah...
UNK: ...and you're wrecking it.
Chandler : But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly.
Ross : I'm sorry, Chandler, but this is really important to me.
Chandler : Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Monica : Hey, you think you can keep it another night?
Chandler : Santa? Really?
UNK: Yeah, is that okay?
Chandler : Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
Phoebe : - No. - Then it's okay!
Ross : Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.
Ross : Say goodbye.
Ben : No, why does he have to go?
Chandler : Because if Santa and the Holiday...
UNK: ...Armadillo...
Chandler : ...are ever in the same room for too long...
Chandler : ...the universe will implode!
Ross : Merry Christmas!
Ben : No, why can't the armadillo leave? I want Santa.
UNK: Fine, I give up. Santa...
Ross : Santa can stay!
Chandler : Well, I'll stay...
UNK: ...but only because I want to hear about Hanukkah.
Chandler : Ben, will you sit here with Santa...
Chandler : ...and learn about Hanukkah?
Ben : Okay, Santa.
Chandler : - Thank you. - You're welcome.
Ross : All right, it's time...
Ross : ...for the story of Hanukkah.
Ross : Years and years ago...
