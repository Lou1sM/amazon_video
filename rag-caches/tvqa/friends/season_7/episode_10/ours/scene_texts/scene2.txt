Phoebe : That's fun.
Gunther : Here you go.
Chandler : Thank you, Gunther. Put her there.
Chandler : Definitely not easier with coins.
Chandler : - Thank you. - Thank you.
Joey : - Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.
UNK: Here. Now I only owe you 49.50.
Joey : Hey, Pheebs...
UNK: ...if you want to get Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building...
Chandler : ...why not get him something more subtle...
Chandler : ...like a wrecking ball...
UNK: ...or a vial of smallpox to release in the hallway?
Monica : It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes...
Monica : ...Joey throws his sticks in the air...
UNK: ...and I have to hear : "Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"
Monica : - I mean, it is so annoying. - Yes, thank you.
Phoebe : You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Monica : Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...
UNK: ...so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?
Phoebe : Maybe on some level.
UNK: Joey, you know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Joey : What is rock 'n' roll about that?
Phoebe : Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
UNK: Hold it! Before you tell me what it is...
Joey : Okay, what is it?
Phoebe : It's a...
UNK: ...tarantula!
UNK: God, Rachel, I'm sorry. What was I thinking...
Phoebe : ...giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider...
Phoebe : ...in such a poorly constructed cage?
Rachel : What are you talking about? I love them.
Rachel : I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it died because my cat ate it.
UNK: And then my cat died.
Rachel : But, Joey, isn't this cool?
Joey : Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got...
Rachel : Oh, isn't that adorable?
Rachel : Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Phoebe : He's so adorable.
Phoebe : God, he's just so much fun.
UNK: Joey's the best. I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
Rachel : Wait a minute.
Rachel : What's the matter?
Phoebe : Our apartment is ready.
Rachel : And that makes you angry because...?
Phoebe : Because you'd rather live here with Joey.
Rachel : - Where did you get that? - Monica and Chandler...
Phoebe : ...said that you were having so much fun here...
Phoebe : ...and apparently no amount of drums or tarantula is gonna change that.
UNK: Phoebe, did you get all this stuff for Joey...
Rachel : ...to try and drive me out of the apartment?
UNK: You might as well have just gotten him a fish.
UNK: You know how fish freak me out.
UNK: Fish.
UNK: But it wouldn't have mattered. You and I are gonna live together.
Rachel : We're roommates. That's the deal.
Phoebe : Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me.
Phoebe : But, okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Rachel : It's so much more fun with you.
Phoebe : - We did have fun, didn't we? - We had so much fun.
UNK: Remember the time we were playing with the SuperBall...
UNK: ...and we accidentally threw it through the window and it broke?
UNK: I remember paying for the window, but I don't remember how it broke.
UNK: Yeah, stuff like that.
UNK: Well, anyway, they say, if we want, we could see it tonight.
Rachel : - I would love to. - Yay, okay!
Rachel : - Good, good, good. - Great. All right. Good.
UNK: And Monica asked me to make the drumming stop.
UNK: Done.
