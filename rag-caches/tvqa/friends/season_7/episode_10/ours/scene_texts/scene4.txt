Ross : ...and he sent me here to wish you...
Ross : ...a merry Christmas!
Monica : What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Ross : Santa was unavailable...
Ross : ...so close to Christmas.
Monica : Come in, have a seat.
Monica : You must be exhausted, coming all the way from Texas.
Monica : - Texas? - That's right, Ben.
Ross : I'm Santa's representative...
Ross : ...for all the Southern states.
Ross : And Mexico!
Ross : But Santa sent me here...
Ross : ...to give you these presents, Ben.
Ross : Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
Ben : Wow, thanks!
Ross : You're welcome, Ben.
Ross : Merry Christmas.
Ross : And happy Hanukkah!
Ben : Are you for Hanukkah too? Because I'm part Jewish.
Ross : You are? Me too.
Monica : Because armadillos also wandered in the desert?
UNK: You want to wander in the hall?
Ross : Hey, Ben!
Ross : What if the Holiday Armadillo...
Ross : ...told you all about the Festival of Lights?
UNK: Cool!
Monica : Come on, Ben.
Ross : Years and years ago...
Ross : ...there were these people called...
Ross : ...the Maccabees! - Ho, ho, ho!
Ross : Merry Christmas!
