Ross : ...there were these people called the Maccabees!
Ross : Merry Christmas!
Rachel : Oh, wow, look at this place!
Phoebe : Oh, this is terrible.
UNK: They've made so many changes...
UNK: ...I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore.
Phoebe : Oh, new sconces!
Rachel : - Oh, my God! - What?
UNK: Okay, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall...
Rachel : ...to make that into two bedrooms? - Yeah.
UNK: And that the landlord might find out...
Rachel : ...and then tear it down? - Yeah?
Rachel : Do you really not know where I'm going with this?
UNK: No, of course I do. What?
UNK: It left. It's one huge room.
Ross : Oh, no!
UNK: Wow!
UNK: See?
UNK: I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
UNK: - You can't, because of the new skylight. - There's a skylight?
UNK: Wow!
Rachel : So, what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
UNK: You know, I'm sensing...
Phoebe : ...that my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah?
UNK: Starting to feel her again there, are we?
Phoebe : - A little bit. Yeah. - Yeah.
Rachel : Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
UNK: You heard it too? You have the gift.
UNK: Phoebe, it's okay.
Rachel : I like living with Joey.
Phoebe : - Are you sure? - Please. I hate packing...
UNK: ...it's closer to work.
Rachel : And we do have fun.
UNK: Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Phoebe : - Oh, me too. - I know.
Rachel : Oh, wait. Did you hear that?
UNK: Listen. I'm getting something from your grandmother.
Rachel : She said that since you get to keep the one-bedroom apartment...
Rachel : ...you should give Rachel the purple chair.
Phoebe : No, I do not hear that.
UNK: Oh, no, wait a minute. Oh, okay.
UNK: She didn't say "chair," she said "share." You should share the one-bedroom apartment.
UNK: Oh, the purple chair. No, yeah, I heard that.
Ross : And the miracle was that that little bit of oil...
UNK: ...that should have lasted just one day, burned for...
Ben : - Eight whole days. - That's right.
UNK: And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Ben : - Awesome. - Yeah.
Chandler : My favorite part...
Chandler : ...was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Ross : The armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part.
UNK: Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?
UNK: Because Aunt Monica was very, very good this year.
UNK: Okay, Ben, it's time to light...
Ross : ...the Hanukkah candles!
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Ross : Come on, come on. We're lighting the candles.
Phoebe : I understand why Superman is here...
Phoebe : ...but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
UNK: - Did you get it? - I got it.
Joey : Is it back in the cage?
UNK: It's back in the cage.
UNK: Is the cage closed?
UNK: Joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
