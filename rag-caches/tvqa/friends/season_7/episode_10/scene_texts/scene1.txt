UNK: Great, you're home.
Joey : Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas.
Rachel : - Drums? - No, drums!
Chandler : Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
Monica : I'm sorry. But not that sorry, because you don't have to live with it.
Monica : We have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
UNK: Okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
UNK: Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to The Music Man at 8.
Phoebe : I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Chandler : Is this because of the burrito thing?
Monica : - You need to give him money. - Give him money? It was a joke!
Monica : No. To get a table. Places like this are always shaking you down.
UNK: - Everybody wants a payoff. - All right, calm down, O'Malley.
Chandler : - I'll slip him some money. - But you've got to be smooth about it.
Chandler : Hey, I can be smooth.
UNK: We're in a bit of a hurry, so if you could get us a table...
Chandler : ...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
UNK: Maitre D' : - Of course, sir. - Okay.
UNK: - How'd it go? - Had the money in the wrong hand.
UNK: Hey. You don't feel...
UNK: ...like you're gonna throw up, do you? - No.
Ross : Well, I do. So let's...
Ross : So, Ben, you...
Ross : You know what holiday is coming up, don't you?
UNK: Christmas.
UNK: Yeah, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Ben : Christmas Eve.
Ross : Yes, but also...
UNK: Hanukkah!
Ross : See, you're part Jewish, and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Ben : Santa has reindeers that can fly.
Ross : Right, but on Hanukkah...
Ross : Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle.
Ross : See, years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Ross : Okay, that's right. Yes...
UNK: ...but on Hanukkah, we sing :
Ross : Okay, it's not a contest.
Ben : When is Santa coming?
Ross : How about this year, instead of Santa...
Ross : ...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Ben : No Santa?
Ben : Was I bad?
UNK: No. Oh, no, no. Hey, you weren't bad. You've been very good, Ben.
Ben : - Santa's mad at me. - No, hey, hey, come on.
Ross : Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?
Ross : You're his favorite little guy.
Ben : So Santa's coming?
UNK: Yes!
Ben : Santa's coming.
UNK: Will he bring me an ant farm?
UNK: Will you keep it at Mommy's?
Chandler : - Okay. - Then sure!
UNK: Maybe this slipping-him-money thing is not gonna work.
UNK: Maybe we should just wait.
UNK: You're the one who said you would die if you didn't see Music Man.
UNK: I didn't say "die."
UNK: I said "cry."
Monica : It's easy. Just keep it casual.
Monica : Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money.
Chandler : - How do you know so much about this? - I don't know.
Chandler : Richard used to do it, didn't he?
Monica : We'd be eating our soup right now.
Chandler : Mustached bastard.
Monica : Okay, those people just left. Come on. Quick, give him the money.
Chandler : Excuse me.
UNK: We're in a bit of a hurry. Can we...?
Phoebe : So you like the drums.
All : That's great.
UNK: You know, I was worried that they would create maybe...
Phoebe : ...an unbearable living situation.
UNK: But, okay, well, apparently not. So, yay!
Joey : Hey, Pheebs, we already learned a song.
Joey : Ready? One, two, three, four.
UNK: Tequila!
