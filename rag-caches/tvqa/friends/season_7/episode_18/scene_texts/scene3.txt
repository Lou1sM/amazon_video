Joey : Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
UNK: A kid in my class said he's in love with me.
UNK: Whoa!
Rachel : - Whoa, what? - Ross has a boyfriend!
Ross : I do not have a boyfriend.
UNK: There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me.
Ross : - Really? - Yeah.
UNK: Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...
Ross : What is it? Am I giving out some kind of...
UNK: ...sexy-professor vibe?
Rachel : Not right now.
Ross : The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Rachel : Now I feel bad for the kid.
Rachel : I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard.
UNK: I couldn't concentrate. I blushed every time he looked at me.
UNK: You remember what it's like to be 19 and in love.
Ross : - I can cut him some slack. - Yeah.
UNK: - How'd you get over that teacher? - I didn't. I got under him.
Joey : Problem solved.
Jake : - Bye, Phoebe. - Okay, bye.
