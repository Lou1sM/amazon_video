UNK: Oh, well, I was in the bathroom, and Susan Lucci came out of a stall...
UNK: ...and she had toilet paper on her shoe, so I took it.
UNK: - Favorite Returning Male... - This is my category!
UNK: - Got your speech? - Got my speech.
UNK: Got your gracious-loser face?
UNK: Try to remember, if you win, you have to hug me.
Joey : Can I squeeze your ass?
Rachel : On TV?
UNK: Yeah!
UNK: They say you can't go home again...
UNK: ...but these four exceptional actors have proven that this is not always the case.
