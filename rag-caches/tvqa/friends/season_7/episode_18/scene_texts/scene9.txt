Morse : - Why? - Because you're marrying him!
Monica : You gotta help me out here.
UNK: I've never been engaged. I've never really been married.
Phoebe : I can only tell you what my mother told me.
UNK: When you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship...
UNK: ...don't communicate them to your husband.
UNK: I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears...
UNK: ...with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with?
Phoebe : That is correct. Yes.
UNK: You're supposed to put all that stuff in a little box in your mind...
UNK: ...and lock it up.
Monica : - Your mother told you this? - Yes.
UNK: The woman who married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
UNK: Oh, my God, you're right.
Phoebe : Tell Chandler. Hurry, before it's too late!
UNK: Wait! Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love?
UNK: - I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! - Wait, wait.
UNK: Rach, please be cool, okay? I work with this woman.
