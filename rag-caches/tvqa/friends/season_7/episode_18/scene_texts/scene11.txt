Joey : - Take it back? - Absolutely.
Joey : Yeah, you do!
UNK: Honey? As we get closer to the wedding...
Monica : ...is there anything you'd like to share?
UNK: Okay. I think the centerpieces are too big.
UNK: You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine.
Monica : - Do you ever get scared at all? - Kind of. They're really big.
UNK: Doesn't it freak you out that you'll never be with anybody new again?
UNK: What?
Monica : I love you so much.
Monica : Sometimes it bothers me that I'll never have that feeling.
UNK: When you first meet someone...
UNK: ...and it's new and exciting. You know that rush?
UNK: No, when I first meet somebody...
UNK: ...it's mostly panic, anxiety and a great deal of sweating.
UNK: Okay. But you're a guy.
UNK: Aren't you freaked out that you'll never sleep with anybody else?
UNK: Sleeping with somebody, no.
UNK: Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid, even more sweating.
Monica : Even with me?
UNK: I was dangerously dehydrated the first six months of our relationship.
UNK: For me, the rush is knowing that we'll be together the rest of our lives.
Ross : - Really? - Well, yeah.
UNK: Knowing you're having these thoughts, we're back to panic, anxiety and...
UNK: ...I'll definitely need some kind of sports drink.
UNK: Come here. Oh, you don't have to worry.
UNK: Besides, you know what? I'll have a lot of new things with you.
Monica : The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid.
Chandler : Water. Water. Water.
Ross : Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you for a moment?
Morse : That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little haircut?
UNK: Yeah, yeah. Do you like it? Do you love it?
UNK: I want you to know I'm changing your grade back.
Morse : What? Why?
UNK: I know what you're trying to pull here. It won't work.
UNK: I'm not trying to pull anything. Look, I love you, dude.
UNK: I'm not even gonna talk about this. This little "thing" is over.
Ross : I know you have a girlfriend. And I know about the other professors.
Ross : How do you think that makes me feel? You used me!
UNK: You don't love me and you never did!
Ross : Professor Winston. Professor Frederickson.
UNK: I'll be right with you.
UNK: Don't make this worse and I'll give you a "C." Shall we?
UNK: I'll be out in a second.
UNK: "It's just so unexpected!
UNK: I'll tell you, it's such an honor to just be nominated...
Phoebe : ...for a Nobel Prize.
UNK: And, you know, to win one for a massage!
UNK: Especially just after winning a Tony Award for Best Actress..."
UNK: Our reservations are at 8.
UNK: "...in Reservations at Eight by Neil Simon.
UNK: Thank you, Neil. Thank you for the words."
Rachel : Finish this later. We're gonna be late.
UNK: Please don't play the music. Just one more thing.
UNK: "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"
