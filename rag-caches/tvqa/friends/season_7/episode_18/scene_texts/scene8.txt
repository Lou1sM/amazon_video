UNK: I was this close to getting Luke and Laura to sign Susan Lucci's toilet paper.
UNK: We had to get out of there because... Look what I won!
Rachel : Oh, my God. You stole her award!
UNK: No, no, no. I'm accepting it on her behalf.
UNK: I don't think you know what "behalf" means.
UNK: Sure I do. It's a verb. As in "I be half-in' it"!
UNK: - You've got to take this back. - I should've won. I really wanted it.
UNK: She didn't care enough to come to the thing. It could also be a Grammy.
Rachel : No, Joey.
Joey : No one saw me take it. There's a whole table of them.
UNK: Do you want an award you didn't win?
Joey : No, I want an award I did win. But nobody's given me any of those!
UNK: If I put it up, when people come over, they'll see it...
UNK: ...and think I won it.
Rachel : Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress."
Joey : I can scratch that right off.
UNK: This is wrong. You have to take it back.
UNK: You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented.
UNK: Someday you'll win one of these for real and that one will mean something.
UNK: - Oh, all right. - All right? Thank you.
UNK: - I'll take it back tomorrow. - Thank you.
UNK: If I can't have it, you can't have it!
Lewis : - Professor Geller? - Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?
UNK: I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff.
UNK: But I was hoping you could change my grade.
Ross : And why, exactly, would I do that?
UNK: Because I'm in love with you.
UNK: What?
UNK: Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.
Lewis : - So could you change my grade? - No!
UNK: Why not? You changed Ned's grade.
UNK: That's different. Because he was actually in love with me.
UNK: No, he's not! He's totally yanking your chain.
UNK: He's done this with three other teachers.
Lewis : - What? - He's got a girlfriend.
UNK: I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
Joey : I know.
UNK: It's awful.
Lewis : I love you.
Jake : - All right. - What? It's true.
UNK: Oh, God... Okay. Oh, you love me? You love me?
UNK: All right, fine. You love me so much, come over here and give me a kiss.
UNK: You got an 80! You didn't even fail! Have some self-respect!
Monica : - Have you seen Chandler? - No, why?
UNK: I keep thinking about all the things I won't have.
UNK: It's freaking me out. I don't know what to do.
UNK: Don't sweat it.
UNK: Chandler's not around, so get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
UNK: Come on, I'm serious.
UNK: - I've got to talk to him about this. - That's the last thing you want to do.
