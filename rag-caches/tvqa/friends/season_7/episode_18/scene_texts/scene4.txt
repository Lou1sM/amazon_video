Jake : - All right. Bye. - Bye.
UNK: Bye!
UNK: [scene : - Bye! - I'll miss you!
UNK: I'll miss you too!
Phoebe : We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
UNK: It's okay. You don't have to tiptoe around me.
UNK: I've thought about it. You know what?
UNK: I'm okay, not having that new-relationship feeling.
Jake : - I miss you already! - I miss you too!
UNK: That's great, but I wouldn't trade what I have for that.
UNK: I'll be with Chandler the rest of my life. That makes me happy.
UNK: Come sit down. We're talking about how our relationship's deep...
Monica : ...and meaningful. It is, don't you think?
Chandler : Oh, totally.
Chandler : Pull my finger.
UNK: Okay, everybody, we're back in 30.
