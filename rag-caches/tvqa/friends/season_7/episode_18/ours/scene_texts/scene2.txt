UNK: Stop it. You're getting me all tingly.
Phoebe : All I could think of was, is he gonna kiss me?
Monica : - Did he? - I'm a lady. I don't kiss and tell.
Phoebe : But this hickey speaks for itself.
Monica : Okay, I got it. I got it.
UNK: I like him so much, I feel like I've had 10 drinks today.
UNK: I've only had six.
UNK: I haven't had that feeling since I first went out with Chandler.
UNK: - I'll never have that feeling again. - You sound like a guy.
UNK: No, a guy would say, "I'll never get to sleep with anyone else."
UNK: I'll never sleep with anyone else!
UNK: - Are you just realizing this now? - No. Maybe. Yes!
UNK: I'm so busy planning the wedding, I forgot about what I'll give up.
UNK: I'll never have a first kiss again.
UNK: You'll have a last kiss.
UNK: Can I ask you something? Has a guy ever had a crush on you?
