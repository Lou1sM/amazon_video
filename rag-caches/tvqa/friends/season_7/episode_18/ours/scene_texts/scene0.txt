UNK: So, Pheebs, I was just at this bachelorette party...
UNK: ...and they had a cake that was in the shape of a man's...
UNK: ...thing-a-ding-ding.
UNK: And I was wondering, what would you have thought of that?
UNK: Offensive or amusing?
UNK: I'm not sure. Monica, what do you think?
UNK: - Sounds kind of tacky. - Damn it.
UNK: I'll see if they can cancel it. If not, maybe they can put eyes on the "hoojies"...
UNK: ...and we'll just say it's just some sort of weird elephant.
UNK: Guys, you won't believe this!
UNK: - I just talked to my agent... - Oh, my God!
UNK: I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.
Joey : I got nominated for Days of our Lives!
Phoebe : - Good for you! - Congratulations!
UNK: I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Monica : - Soap Opera Digest Award? - Nope. I'm up for a "Soapie."
UNK: Is that something you're making up?
UNK: No, no, no, it's real! And it has been, since 1998.
UNK: Okay, they said they won't cancel the cake...
UNK: ...but I was thinking we could write "NASA" on the side...
UNK: ...and then give it to Ross. - Okay. Yeah.
UNK: Hey, Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: Oh, my God! That's the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
UNK: Thank you! I guess we know who I'll take to the awards!
UNK: Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Joey : Many are scheduled to appear.
UNK: - I can't go. I'll be too nervous! - I'll go.
Rachel : You're getting married. This is all I have.
UNK: - We should celebrate. - Yes! And we will get you a cake...
UNK: ...in the shape of a microphone.
UNK: With two tennis balls.
UNK: The One With Joey's Award
UNK: ...to frighten off predators.
Ross : Mr. Lewis?
UNK: What kind of noise?
UNK: Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.
Lewis : But like how?
UNK: Well, we don't know for sure.
Ross : But in my head, it sounded something like this :
Ross : Of course, this is just conjecture.
UNK: Okay. That's all for today.
Ross : Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Morse : Yes, sir?
Ross : I need to talk to you about your midterm exam.
UNK: - I'm afraid I had to fail you. - Why?
Ross : Well, you need 60% to pass.
UNK: - What did I get? - Seven.
UNK: That's not so good.
UNK: No, no, it's not. What happened, Ned?
Morse : Maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
UNK: I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.
UNK: I'm in love with you.
Ross : That brings me in the loop a little.
