Ross : Guess what I got for your wedding?
UNK: A freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head?
Ross : Rachel hooked me up with a tux. But not just any tux.
UNK: Batman's tux!
Melissa : - What? - That's right.
Ross : Made expressly for Val Kilmer, and worn by him in the hit film...
Ross : ...that Batman film he was in.
UNK: You can't wear that. I'm wearing the famous tux.
UNK: - James Bond's tux! - So?
UNK: So? If you wear that, it'll make mine less special.
Ross : You need something to make this day special?
UNK: Hello! You have the most special thing of all.
Ross : You are marrying the woman you love.
UNK: Don't take away my cool thing. Pretty please?
UNK: "Pretty please?" Not very 007.
Chandler : If you were getting married, I'd never do anything to upset you.
Ross : - You slept with my sister. - That was pretty 007.
UNK: Okay, good, you're here. All right, I figured it out.
UNK: I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, add your parents...
UNK: ...and make them into 3 tables of 6.
Monica : And I called the caterer. We are good to go!
UNK: Yeah. They're not coming.
UNK: What?
UNK: They think that you only invited them because of me.
UNK: They feel unwanted.
UNK: That's too bad. It's true. But too bad.
Joey : If you could just call my mom.
UNK: Just let her know you want them there.
Joey : This is a woman who has sent you many lasagnas.
UNK: No, she hasn't.
Joey : Is it her fault if some didn't make it to you?
UNK: What am I gonna say?
UNK: Tell them you mixed up invitations. No, blame it on the post office.
Joey : They hate the post office. And the Irish.
UNK: But I don't think you could blame it on them.
UNK: Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbiani? This is Monica Geller.
UNK: I'm just calling to say that we really hope you can make it to the wedding.
UNK: Apparently some of our invitations weren't delivered.
UNK: I guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office.
Monica : Tell me about it!
Monica : Yeah, the U.S. Post Office? No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
Monica : What are they, Irish?
UNK: Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've been going out for three years.
Melissa : He was my first client when I became a party planner.
UNK: He was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Melissa : Oh, well.
Melissa : - He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. - That's great.
Melissa : - Were you ever in a sorority? - Of course.
UNK: Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.
Melissa : What one?
UNK: We were huge too. But they had to shut us down...
UNK: ...when Regina Phalangie died of alcohol poisoning.
UNK: Isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
UNK: Anyway...
Rachel : Speaking of drinking too much, I told Phoebe...
UNK: ...about that crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where we made out.
UNK: What?
UNK: Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops.
Rachel : We went back to the house and got really silly...
UNK: ...and we made out.
Melissa : Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea what you're talking about.
UNK: Really?
Chandler : Ross is Batman.
Monica : Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Chandler : Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
Chandler : Batman is so much cooler than James Bond.
UNK: - What? 007 has all those gadgets. - Batman has a utility belt.
