Chandler : - You mean like for award shows? - Some of them.
UNK: They've been down the red carpet with people yelling :
Chandler : "Who are you wearing? You look fabulous!"
Rachel : Might I suggest watching a little more ESPN...
Rachel : ...and a little less E!
Chandler : Okay. Who wore those?
UNK: - Well, this one's Tom Brokaw. - Not bad.
UNK: This one is Paul O'Neill.
UNK: Who's that?
Rachel : He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN.
UNK: Just once in a while. Have it on in the background.
Rachel : - This one was Pierce Brosnan. - Pierce Brosnan?
Chandler : Are you serious?
UNK: 007?
UNK: This is James Bond's tux? I have to get married in James Bond's tux.
UNK: It's a pretty cool tux.
UNK: It's not just that. I would be England's most powerful weapon.
UNK: A jet-setting heartbreaker on Her Majesty's secret service.
Chandler : A man who fears no one, with a license to kill.
Chandler : Would Monica let me wear this?
Joey : We should really learn how to play the real way.
Phoebe : I like our way.
UNK: Chess!
Joey : - Nice move. - Yeah.
UNK: I hooked Ross and Chandler up with tuxedos. Do you need one?
UNK: No, I'm not wearing a tux.
UNK: - What are you gonna wear? - Multi-colored robes.
Joey : And maybe a hat.
Rachel : - Does Monica know about this? - No.
Rachel : Can I please be there when you tell her?
Phoebe : You want to go to a movie tonight?
UNK: I'm having dinner with Melissa.
Joey : Can I come?
UNK: I won't talk. You'll just hear my video camera.
UNK: - What? What's going on? - Can I tell her?
UNK: Do you want what happened, or Joey's lewd version?
UNK: - Joey's. - Okay.
UNK: I had this college friend...
UNK: ...and I made the mistake of telling Joey that one time...
UNK: ...she and I, you know, kissed a little bit.
UNK: Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
Rachel : - It did. - Sure.
UNK: Hey. It happened.
Rachel : It was senior year. It was after the Sigma Chi luau...
Rachel : ...and Melissa and I got very drunk.
Rachel : And we ended up kissing.
Rachel : For several minutes.
Phoebe : Which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek.
Joey : Why are you taking this away from me?
Rachel : Why is it so hard for you to believe?
UNK: Okay. I just didn't know that you were a lesbian.
UNK: I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian. I'm just saying that this happened.
Phoebe : It just seems pretty wild. And you're so...
UNK: ...vanilla.
UNK: Vanilla? I'm not vanilla. I do lots of crazy things.
UNK: I mean, I got drunk and married in Vegas.
Phoebe : To Ross.
UNK: If you don't believe me...
Rachel : ...just come with me to dinner tonight and she'll tell you.
UNK: Okay. Because I can't picture it.
Joey : You should get inside my head.
