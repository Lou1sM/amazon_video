UNK: Melissa Worbert. I don't think I have the energy for this.
UNK: Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene?
UNK: What's up?!
UNK: You've been MIA for seven sorority newsletters.
UNK: What's up with you?
UNK: Why don't I tell you over here?
Melissa : So last I heard you were gonna get married.
Melissa : Poor Ray-Ray.
UNK: Oh, no. It's all good.
Rachel : - I actually work at Ralph Lauren. - Shut up!
UNK: I will not. I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear.
Melissa : Shut up more! Are you friends with Ralph?
Rachel : - Oh, please. - Are you?
UNK: No.
Melissa : We have to have dinner. What are you doing tomorrow?
UNK: - Tomorrow. I don't know. - You're having dinner with me.
Melissa : Shut up.
UNK: I've gotta go. This has been so great.
Melissa : Oh, there you are. You're a bad man for giving me these.
UNK: - So listen, just call me. Here's my card. - Oh, wow, thanks.
UNK: - You're in real estate? - No, that's an old card.
UNK: I got out of that to do something...
UNK: ...where I could help people and make a difference.
Rachel : What do you do now?
UNK: I'm a party planner.
UNK: - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.
UNK: Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.
