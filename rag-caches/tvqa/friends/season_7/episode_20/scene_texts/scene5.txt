Monica : - 007 has a fancy car. - Batman has the Batmobile.
Monica : - 007 gets all the ladies. - Batman has Robin.
Chandler : We get ESPN, right?
Monica : How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?
UNK: I don't like martinis.
UNK: - A Yoo-hoo with a funny straw? - Yum.
UNK: I know the invitation says 6 p. M.
UNK: But does that mean get there at 6, or the show starts at 6?
UNK: "The show"?
Joey : Right, the wedding. Gotcha.
UNK: But weddings start a little late, right?
Monica : Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
UNK: Well, it's the same day as my niece's christening...
UNK: ...and I want my parents to see me.
UNK: My part's in the beginning. I'm not in the rest of the show... Wedding.
UNK: The wedding starts at 6.
UNK: Okay. I totally hear you.
Joey : How about this? I vamp till they get there.
UNK: You'll "vamp"?
Joey : Like warm up the crowd. Ask where they're from.
UNK: Because in Joey Tribbiani, you get a minister and an entertainer.
UNK: I'm a "ministainer." All right?
UNK: There's no one better. There's no one greater.
UNK: Oh, please, God. Don't vamp.
UNK: Okay, maybe I'll talk to Chandler.
UNK: And maybe he'd like to get married at 007 o'clock.
UNK: All right. I will give you 10 extra minutes. That is it.
UNK: That's great! Thank you so much.
UNK: Well, we're in luck. The tux fits perfectly.
UNK: Chandler, that jacket, it's way too big.
UNK: Oh, that's okay. The pants are way too small.
UNK: I'm sorry, sweetie. You cannot wear that.
UNK: Now this means Ross is gonna be the only cool one.
UNK: Something, by the way, I never thought I would say.
UNK: Dude, take that thing off. You look like a fool.
UNK: Come next door. I got some minister headdresses I want you to see.
Rachel : How can you not remember us kissing?
UNK: I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Rachel : Remember, we were on the sleeping porch? We couldn't stop giggling.
UNK: Our coconuts kept knocking together.
UNK: Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
UNK: I don't want to make you uncomfortable...
UNK: ...but I told Phoebe it happened, and she doesn't believe me.
UNK: I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought it happened, I would say it.
Melissa : Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
UNK: No!
Monica : - All right. - Okay, fine.
UNK: You don't have to admit it because I know that it happened.
UNK: Okay!
UNK: You have to admit it! We kissed! Say it!
UNK: It's okay, you don't have to do this. I believe you.
UNK: If you say you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Rachel : - Thank you, Phoebe. - Okay.
UNK: - But she didn't. - I know.
UNK: You carry that around?
Ross : Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Monica : - Between you and...? - Gunther.
UNK: Why don't we put them on?
Ross : Get a picture of Batman and James Bond, together.
Chandler : I would, but my pants are a little tight.
Chandler : A little tight? I could see 00 and 7 in those things.
Ross : Well, that stinks.
UNK: I was looking forward to wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
UNK: - So you're not gonna be wearing yours? - Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!
Chandler : Let me try it on.
