Rachel : That was my friend, Melissa, from college.
Ross : She seems really, really fun!
UNK: She's actually sweet, and we used to be very close.
Monica : Wait a minute. She's not the one who you...?
Joey : Who you what? Who you what?
Rachel : - Yes. - Wow!
UNK: Wow, what? Who you what?
UNK: Oh, it's not a big deal.
Monica : They were lovers.
Melissa : - What? - What?
UNK: No, we weren't. It was nothing.
Rachel : It was one night, senior year, and we went to a party...
Rachel : ...had a lot of sangria, and you know, ended up...
Rachel : ...kissing for a bit.
UNK: So that's two of my wives.
UNK: Where are you going?
UNK: To bring her back here! Ross, get the sangria!
UNK: The One With Rachel's Big Kiss
UNK: Why don't we just put me with a Manhattan in my hand...
Rachel : ...talking to the cute bartender.
UNK: These pins aren't for playing, are they?
UNK: The red are my guests, and the blue are yours.
Chandler : This is so sad. I only have like 10 pins.
UNK: Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.
Monica : Certainly not a close one.
Joey : Hey, Rach.
Rachel : Stop picturing it!
UNK: I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding.
UNK: They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Joey : So where are my parents gonna be?
UNK: Well, if this is the wedding hall...
UNK: ...then your parents would be over here at home in Queens.
UNK: They're not invited? Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!
UNK: Why would they think they're invited?
UNK: You got me. I don't...
UNK: [scene : - Joey! - Look, I thought parents were coming.
UNK: Your parents are coming. Chandler's are coming.
UNK: Ross' parents are coming.
UNK: Ross' parents are my parents.
UNK: Well, see, parents are coming.
Chandler : - We should invite them. - You just want more blue pins.
Chandler : Well, this is just sad.
Monica : All right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging.
UNK: Rachel may have to sit at the bar.
Rachel : That is not a problem.
UNK: - Maybe you'll order a little sangria. - Get out of here!
UNK: These are our tuxedos. If you like anything, we can make a deal.
UNK: Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
UNK: Thanks a lot for hooking me up.
UNK: And I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
UNK: I'm Monica's maid of honor.
UNK: Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.
UNK: - Well, these look nice. - They are nice.
UNK: When celebrities are done with them, they send them back.
