Ross : Okay. But just the jacket. 00 and 7 are not getting in there.
Chandler : Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!
UNK: What's this?
UNK: An invitation to the At First Sight premiere?
UNK: Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman.
UNK: He wore it to the premiere of a fruity love story where he was a blind guy.
Ross : Let me see that.
Ross : Oh, man.
UNK: The only super power you have is the slightly heightened sense of smell.
Joey : Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Monica : I give up. Whatever you want, you can have it.
UNK: You want to sing a song or do a dance?
UNK: You want your mom at the altar screaming racial slurs? I don't care.
UNK: I just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents.
UNK: They're so happy to be a part of your special day.
UNK: Tell them we're glad they're coming.
UNK: I will. Oh, check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
Joey : I wear it like this when I marry you guys. And then this...
Joey : ...is for party time.
Joey : It happened. I am telling you it happened.
Melissa : It was great meeting you.
UNK: And, Rachel? I don't think I'll be calling you because...
UNK: ...you know, you've gotten weird.
Melissa : Take care, you guys.
UNK: Wait a minute. Okay, look.
Rachel : That night was the one wild thing I've ever done in my life.
UNK: I won't let you take it away.
UNK: So if you don't remember that, maybe you'll remember this...
UNK: Oh, my God. You love me.
UNK: What?
Melissa : Of course I remember. I think about it all the time.
Melissa : I can still hear the coconuts knocking together...
UNK: I didn't want to tell you, because I didn't think you'd return my love...
UNK: Look who's being suddenly shy.
UNK: You have to feel what I feel.
Melissa : Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
UNK: I'm just a good kisser.
Melissa : Shut up.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: You don't have to be sorry.
UNK: I'm obviously kidding.
UNK: I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her.
UNK: I don't hear coconuts banging together.
UNK: I don't picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend.
Melissa : Anyway, I gotta go.
UNK: A kiss goodbye?
Melissa : No? Okay.
Rachel : I mean, I had no idea that that would...
Rachel : What the hell was that?
Phoebe : Just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
UNK: [scene : - And? - I've had better.
Chandler : I found one that fits.
UNK: Well, you know what they say? 23rd time's a charm.
Rachel : Look at you, all handsome.
Chandler : - Whose is it? - Does it matter?
Rachel : All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Chandler : - Whose is it? - I don't want to say.
UNK: Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?
Rachel : Diane Keaton.
