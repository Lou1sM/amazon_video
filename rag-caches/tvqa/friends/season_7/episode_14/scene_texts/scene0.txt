Ross : Happy birthday!
Ross : Happy birthday!
All : Rach, come on.
UNK: It's your birthday!
UNK: Hey...
UNK: She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
UNK: Ms. Green wants to establish some ground rules before she comes out.
UNK: She'd appreciate it if you didn't use the words "old" or "downhill"...
UNK: ...or "They still look pretty damn good."
Joey : They do.
Phoebe : Rachel, come on out.
Phoebe : Monica made breakfast.
UNK: Chocolate chip pancakes.
UNK: We've got presents.
Rachel : Good ones?
Monica : They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Rachel : Can I keep the presents and still be 29?
UNK: Come on, Rach, turning 30 is not that big a deal.
Ross : Really? Is that how you felt when you turned 30?
Joey : Why, God, why?
Joey : We had a deal. Let the others grow old, not me!
UNK: You know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Ross : Hey, 30 is not that old.
Ross : Do you know how old the Earth is?
UNK: Late 30s?
Rachel : You guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting?
UNK: No, it's not just you. My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.
Joey : And now Chandler!
UNK: We're all getting so old.
Joey : Why are you doing this to us?
UNK: I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry at this one.
UNK: I know my life's going pretty well, but I see so many people...
UNK: ...who've accomplished their goals before they're 30.
UNK: Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
All : - Come on, Phoebe! - You can do it!
All : - Come on. - There you go.
Phoebe : I did it! One mile on a Hippity Hop.
UNK: That's everything I wanted to do before I was 30.
Phoebe : Except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.
UNK: Oh, well. But, yeah!
Phoebe : Girls, this thing is a godsend, if you know what I mean.
UNK: Thirty. Oh, I mean, 30.
UNK: Monica, you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreiger in fifth grade? She was 30.
UNK: Let's have some fun. What do you want to do?
UNK: Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
UNK: Doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Ross : That was a practical purchase.
Ross : I needed that car for transportation.
UNK: Okay? I have a child.
Ross : How hot do I look in this?
Chandler : Ross, a sports car?
UNK: Wouldn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
UNK: That's not what this is about.
Ross : I am a sports car enthusiast.
UNK: - I've always been into cars. - What's the horsepower?
UNK: I don't know, but look how shiny!
UNK: - I can't believe you bought this. - Really. God, Ross, what were you thinking?
UNK: I know it's really shallow, but part of me wants him again.
Phoebe : Well, get in line, missy.
