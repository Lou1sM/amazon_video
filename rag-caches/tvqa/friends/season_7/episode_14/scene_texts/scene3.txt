UNK: Look, I know what you're going through.
UNK: I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.
Rachel : Get out of my apartment.
UNK: Rach, I think that you're doing great.
UNK: Let's face it, no one handles this well.
Phoebe : Least of all you.
UNK: - Why, what did you do? - Weren't you asked to leave, sonny?
Chandler : Put that back on. Monica will be here any minute.
UNK: But it hurts my Joey's apple.
UNK: For the last time, it's not named after each individual man.
UNK: You've done a wonderful job with this party, Chandler. Everything's so lovely.
Chandler : Well, not as lovely as you.
UNK: I can't believe you have a 30-year-old daughter.
UNK: And I can't believe you have a tux that's 30 years old.
UNK: It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
UNK: Everybody hide! I saw her. She's coming.
Chandler : Everybody down!
UNK: Crap.
Chandler : Everybody stay here. I'll find out what's going on.
UNK: Hey, you got the door open!
Chandler : Hey, are you drunk?
UNK: No.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: See, I was a little nervous about turning...
UNK: ...30.
UNK: So the busboys took me out for some drinks.
UNK: Might want to puke on you later.
UNK: Here's the thing. We've thrown a very formal surprise party for you.
Chandler : - Your friends are in there, and your parents. - No!
Chandler : - Yes! Yes! - No.
Monica : Oh, no! My parents have never seen me drunk.
Monica : That they know of.
UNK: We'll get you some coffee. They'll never know that you're drunk.
Monica : - You promise? - I'll take care of it.
Monica : I love you so much.
Chandler : Okay, we have to do something about your breath.
Monica : What about your breath?
UNK: That's still yours.
Chandler : Now remember, it's a surprise party.
Chandler : So when you go in, act surprised.
UNK: Ready?
UNK: Surprise!
Ross : Okay, forward. Forward.
UNK: Stop!
UNK: Okay, back... Stop!
UNK: Okay, for... Stop!
Ross : Stop! Stop!
Monica : Ross, just forget about it. The guy's got you totally wedged in.
Woman : - Is this yours? - No, it's mine! It's mine.
UNK: Dude, you so need this car.
UNK: Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
UNK: I'll break into this minivan, put it in neutral.
UNK: You push it forward so Ross can drive out of the spot.
Phoebe : All right. Here we go.
Phoebe : Haul ass!
