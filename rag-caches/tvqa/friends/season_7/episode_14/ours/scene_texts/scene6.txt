UNK: Did I not tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
UNK: How you feeling?
Monica : You are so handsome.
UNK: I want to make love to you right here, right now.
UNK: I really wish that you wouldn't.
Chandler : Just get through a little bit more, then we can put you in bed.
UNK: Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Phoebe : Speech, speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl.
UNK: Pheebs!
UNK: See, everybody's looking at me.
UNK: The plan's working.
UNK: I didn't even have to take off my top yet.
All : Speech. Come on, speech!
UNK: You can't keep your hands off her for one second.
UNK: I think it's nice.
UNK: I think it's necessary.
UNK: I want to thank you all for coming.
Monica : My family and...
Monica : ...my friends.
UNK: I'd really like to say that I'm...
UNK: You know what I'd really like to say?
UNK: I'm drunk!
UNK: That's right, Mom and Dad.
UNK: Your little Harmomica is hammered.
Monica : And guess what?
UNK: I've been drunk before.
UNK: And I've smoked a cigarette.
UNK: And I've had a box of Ding Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer.
UNK: It's all okay. It's okay because...
UNK: ...I turned 30 today.
Monica : And I can do anything I want.
UNK: Because I am a grownup.
Phoebe : Okay, quick. Help me get this off.
Phoebe : I lost a whole year.
UNK: I can't believe it. This is so unfair!
UNK: Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.
Phoebe : Will it? Will it?
Phoebe : How would you feel if you found out you were 31?
UNK: That's not gonna happen. Because we have a new deal.
UNK: Plus, it ruined my schedule.
UNK: I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31.
UNK: - Like what? - Like I haven't met any Portuguese people.
UNK: I haven't had the perfect kiss.
UNK: And I haven't been to sniper school.
UNK: Why don't we go and have some birthday cake.
Phoebe : I just feel like being by myself for a while. See you guys later. Thanks.
Rachel : Poor Pheebs.
UNK: Hey, you know what, you guys? I think I'm gonna walk her home.
Monica : - Oh, man. - What?
UNK: He's gonna eat the cake.
UNK: Pheebs!
UNK: Listen, I...
Joey : Close your eyes.
