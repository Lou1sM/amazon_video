UNK: That's one thing you can cross off your list.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah.
UNK: Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.
Ross : Okay, is everybody clear?
UNK: We're gonna pick it up...
Ross : ...and move it.
Ross : All we need is teamwork. We're gonna lift the car...
Ross : ...and slide it out.
UNK: Lift...
Ross : ...and slide.
UNK: - Ross, I really don't think this... - Lift...
Ross : ...and slide.
UNK: All right. Come on, dogs, let's lift this sucker.
UNK: Oh, unless you're scared. Little weaklings scared?
UNK: Good teamwork.
Chandler : - Okay, here we go. - All right, everyone.
UNK: Lift...
Ross : ...and slide.
Rachel : - Hey, Joey... - Come on, Rach, my turn just started.
UNK: Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.
Joey : Oh, okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
UNK: Whatever. I'm not your mother.
Rachel : Not in the street!
Tag : - Are you feeling any better? - Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm...
UNK: Let's talk.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: Oh, Tag...
UNK: You're such a great guy. And we have so much fun together.
Rachel : - But I... - Wait.
UNK: I think I see where you're going.
Tag : But before you say anything else, can I say one more thing?
Rachel : Well said.
Rachel : And a good example of the fun I was referring to.
UNK: But I think I'm past the point where I can just have fun.
UNK: Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning 30.
Rachel : Yeah, it is.
UNK: But you're just a kid. I mean, you're 25.
Tag : - Twenty-four, actually. - Oh, God.
UNK: You know what I wish? I wish you were six years older.
UNK: Well, if I'm wishing for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Tag : - Me too. - Yeah. Sorry.
UNK: Hey, how'd it go?
Rachel : If I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Phoebe : You did the right thing.
UNK: I don't like this anymore.
Chandler : Well, here we are. Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.
UNK: Do you realize in 10 years we're gonna be 40?
Joey : Why, God?
Joey : Why are you doing this to us?
UNK: Yes! My baby's finally free.
Monica : All right!
UNK: Start it up. Let's go!
UNK: The Man In The Sportscar : How hot are we?
UNK: You want to buy a car?
