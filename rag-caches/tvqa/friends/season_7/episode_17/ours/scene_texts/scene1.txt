UNK: Sure. Being engaged, I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
UNK: Could you guys help me?
UNK: Yeah, let me get that for you.
UNK: - It's really heavy. - I got it.
UNK: So hi, I'm Ross, and this is my friend Chandler.
UNK: I'm Kristen.
Ross : Kristen, hi. Are you new to the area?
UNK: Because if you are, I'd love to show you around sometime.
Kristen : I actually just moved from four blocks over.
UNK: But this block is like another world.
Ross : Actually, it does have a very interesting history.
UNK: This street is the first in the city to have an underground sewer system.
Ross : Before that, sewage and waste...
Ross : ...would just flow right down the street.
UNK: Sometimes ankle-deep.
UNK: Smooth.
Kristen : Excuse me?
UNK: You're gonna be starving after moving. What do you say I take you to dinner?
UNK: - I'd like that. - Great.
Ross : Let me take this up.
Kristen : - After you. - Oh, no. After you.
Ross : Oh, my God!
