Phoebe : Excuse me! Excuse me!
Monica : Go! Go! Go!
Chandler : So, Ross, how was your date the other night?
Chandler : Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with every flush?
UNK: Laugh all you want, but she said she'd like to go out again.
UNK: In fact, I'll go call her right now.
UNK: And I'll make sure and tell her my friend Chandler says...
UNK: Sorry I didn't stop by last night, but I had a date.
UNK: When it's 1 : 00 in the morning and you don't come by, that's okay.
UNK: It was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street.
Chandler : - Really? Right across the street? - Yeah.
UNK: - When did you meet her? - Two days ago.
UNK: Excellent!
UNK: You know, Ross met somebody too.
Monica : - Hey. - How'd it go?
UNK: Great. We're going out again Saturday.
UNK: But I just found out she's also seeing some other guy.
UNK: Really?
Chandler : Joe, what would you do if you were in Ross' situation?
UNK: I sort of am. I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy.
UNK: But I'm not worried about it.
UNK: You shouldn't be. I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.
Ross : I mean, that doofus is going to lose.
Chandler : So this is nice.
UNK: I wish I didn't have to go. Believe me.
UNK: But I have to.
UNK: By the way, what's the name of the girl you're dating?
UNK: - Kristen Leigh. - Bye.
Ross : Well, obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Joey : Obviously. So how do we decide?
Ross : Well, now, let's look at this objectively.
Ross : I think I should date her.
UNK: Or I'm the one who dates her.
UNK: That's interesting. But check this out. I date her.
UNK: Okay, but to go in another direction...
Ross : Okay. This can go on for a while.
Joey : - We should order some food, then. - No, Joey.
UNK: Look, why don't we just let her decide, okay?
UNK: We'll each go out with her one more time.
UNK: And we'll see who she likes best.
Joey : That sounds fair.
UNK: Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant.
UNK: Wait a second. We have to set a spending limit on the date.
UNK: I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Ross : Well, sorry. That's what I do on dates.
UNK: Well, I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
UNK: - So let's decide on a spending limit. - Yeah.
UNK: And a slice...
UNK: ...$6?
UNK: - I was thinking more like 100. - Okay.
UNK: Can I borrow $94?
UNK: I know. Can you hand me a tissue?
UNK: You're out of Diet Coke.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: What? You what?
Monica : You listen here, missy!
UNK: That was Megan. She booked The Swing Kings on the day of our wedding...
UNK: ...and said I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Phoebe : Does that mean Carcass is available?
