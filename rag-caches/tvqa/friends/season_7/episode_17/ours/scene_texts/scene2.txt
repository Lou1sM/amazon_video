Phoebe : Am I crazy, or does this totally go?
Rachel : Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!
Phoebe : Thank you, Rachel. But look at Monica!
Monica : This is it. Yeah, this is the one.
UNK: I can't believe I found it.
UNK: Wow, you look so beautiful. If I knew you, I'd cry.
UNK: I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.
UNK: I'm Megan Bailey.
Monica : - Have you found your dress? - These dresses are amazing...
UNK: ...but I couldn't afford one. - I can't either.
UNK: I'm here to figure out which one I want, then I'll get it at Kleinman's.
Monica : They're having a huge sale.
Megan : - Thanks for the tip. - When are you getting married?
UNK: - I'm not. I just like to try these on. - I do the same thing.
UNK: I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25.
UNK: I'm just kidding too.
UNK: I'm getting married in December.
Monica : - When are you getting married? - May 15.
UNK: It's getting close. Who's your photographer?
UNK: - Jeffrey. - We met with him.
UNK: - Did he show you nude wedding photos? - The best man? Wow!
Megan : I know. I almost called off my wedding.
UNK: Is that spelled with a C or a K? It doesn't matter, they're both great!
UNK: Oh, don't buy that here.
Rachel : Now that you know what you want, go to Kleinman's.
Rachel : This place is so overpriced.
UNK: I own this store.
UNK: So does this come in another color, or...?
UNK: Hi. You moving in or moving out?
Ross : - Moving in. - Can I give you a hand?
UNK: Okay, but be careful. Guy who was helping me had to leave because he hurt his back.
Joey : - Boyfriend? - No.
UNK: I'm Joey.
UNK: Kristen.
Joey : What a beautiful name.
Joey : What is it again?
UNK: Kristen.
Kristen : - You live around here? - Right down there.
Joey : Let me give you a little tip.
UNK: Don't take a nap on this stoop. You could wake up with your shoes gone.
UNK: I'll remember that.
UNK: Listen, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Kristen : I have plans tonight. How about tomorrow?
Joey : Sounds great. Well, where does this go?
UNK: You look strong. Why don't I take that, and you grab one of the boxes.
UNK: Yeah, I'll get this one.
Rachel : So this is Brooklyn?
UNK: Listen up. There's usually only one dress in each size.
Monica : So when they open those doors, fan out.
UNK: This is what you're looking for. Memorize it.
Monica : When you locate the dress, blow on these, all right?
UNK: Three sharp blasts. When you hear it, come running.
UNK: Here he comes!
UNK: - They're pushing! - Don't be a baby!
Chandler : - Out of the way! - Let's go!
