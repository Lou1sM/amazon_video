UNK: Joey doesn't like to talk about it...
UNK: ...but he's one of the stars of Days of Our Lives.
UNK: That's right. Don't you play a woman?
UNK: A woman in a man's body.
Ross : Much better.
UNK: It's funny, because you look familiar to me too.
Joey : Have you ever been married?
Ross : Yes, I have.
UNK: In fact, just the other day...
UNK: ...Kris and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Kristen : - Little Eric. - That's right. Wait. No, Ben.
UNK: So you've just been married the one time, then?
Ross : - Well... - You've been married twice?
Ross : Yes. And...
Ross : ...another time after that.
UNK: Boy, I'm getting hungry.
Ross : Have you ever been so hungry on a date...
UNK: ...that when the girl goes to the bathroom, you eat her food?
Kristen : You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
UNK: So, Ross, now why did that first marriage break up?
Joey : Was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian?
Kristen : - Do you two know each other? - No.
UNK: Just seems like Ross is the kind of guy who'd marry a woman...
Joey : ...on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Ross : Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Joey : Have you ever slept in the same bed with a monkey?
Ross : You leave Marcel out of this!
UNK: Fine! You ever gotten stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?
Ross : Have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?
UNK: Monkey-lover!
UNK: Where do you think we lost her?
Ross : Probably around gonorrhea.
UNK: Geller, table of two?
UNK: - You hungry? - Does a bear shit in the woods?
UNK: - Hi, honey, I'm home! - Don't come in here!
Chandler : Why, do you have another boyfriend in there?
Monica : No. We only mess around at his place.
UNK: I started it, but now it's scaring me, so could you come out here, please?
UNK: No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Chandler : You got a wedding dress?
UNK: - Yeah, but I'm not keeping it. - Then why can't I see it?
Monica : Oh. I guess you can.
UNK: But I have to return it, so you can't like it.
UNK: Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.
UNK: Wow. You look hideous.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Yeah. That's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen.
Chandler : Why do you have to return it?
UNK: Because it doesn't really fit.
Monica : Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.
UNK: Oh, that's great. Thanks.
UNK: But that dress is terrible.
UNK: - It makes me want to rip it off you. - Okay.
UNK: But you can't rip it.
Monica : Well, maybe a little.
UNK: Guys, you want to look at the song list for the wedding?
UNK: Guys?
Chandler : I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
UNK: All right, what's going on?
UNK: I'm sorry. I should probably leave you girls alone.
UNK: Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes, we'll have younger-looking skin.
UNK: You know, she could use a little...
UNK: Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
