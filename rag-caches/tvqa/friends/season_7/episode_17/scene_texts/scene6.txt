UNK: What am I gonna do? That's the dress! That is the dress!
Monica : Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Phoebe : - Figure out a way to talk him out of it. - How?
UNK: You're out of toilet paper!
UNK: I wanted to wish you good luck on your date.
Megan : - Thanks. - What time are you meeting?
UNK: We have 8 : 00 reservations at Grand Merci Bistro.
UNK: That's in 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
Ross : - I am dressed. - Oh, well, good.
Monica : For me.
UNK: What's this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Ross : I have an oily T-zone.
Joey : Okay, dude.
Joey : - You sent Kristen flowers? - That's right.
UNK: You spent $ 100. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Ross : I sent the flowers before the actual date, so technically...
UNK: ...I didn't break any rules.
Ross : Thanks for stopping by, though.
UNK: That's the way it's gonna be? I can break the rules too.
Ross : - What are you gonna do? - I don't know.
Ross : - Why am I not surprised? - Not gonna let you get away with this.
UNK: - I don't think you have much choice. - We'll see!
Joey : Hey! So, just a light layer?
UNK: Yeah, just here and there.
Chandler : Joey got meat sauce on the banister again.
Phoebe : Swing music is so out.
UNK: He's gotta be in the room for that to work.
Chandler : What are you guys talking about?
UNK: We're talking about The Swing Kings...
UNK: ...and wondering whether they're the right way to go.
Rachel : I went to a wedding once where they had swing music...
Rachel : ...and two months later, the couple divorced.
UNK: I'm not saying there's any connection here...
Rachel : ...but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
Chandler : But I love swing music!
Phoebe : But The Swing Kings?
UNK: They suck so much that people die at their concerts. They just stop living.
UNK: All I know is that when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun.
UNK: And there's another reason.
Rachel : - Well, what is the other reason? - I don't want to say.
Rachel : Well, you have to because maybe it's stupid.
UNK: It's just, while Monica and I were dancing to them...
UNK: ...it was the first time I knew that...
UNK: ...you were the woman that I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Monica : Oh, crap.
UNK: - Our table will be ready in a few minutes. - Oh, great.
Kristen : - Is your back feeling better? - Yeah, that's fine.
Ross : I guess the more muscles you have...
Ross : ...the more they can spasm out of control.
Ross : - Kristen? - Joey!
Kristen : - What are you doing here? - I like this place.
UNK: And technically, I'm not breaking any rules, so...
Kristen : Well, Ross, this is Joey. Joey, Ross.
Monica : - Hi. - Hi. It's nice to meet you.
Ross : I used to have a friend named Joey.
UNK: I don't anymore.
Ross : Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Joey : Sure, I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
UNK: So, Joey, you look familiar.
Ross : Are you on TV or something?
