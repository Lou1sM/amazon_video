UNK: Hey, what's going on?
Ross : I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's.
Ross : Bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
UNK: Yeah, I'll take that.
UNK: What's up?
Chandler : - Monica and I are engaged. - Oh, my God.
UNK: Congratulations. Where is she?
UNK: I'm engaged! I'm engaged!
UNK: She's been there for 20 minutes. You didn't hear?
UNK: I thought it was a kid yelling, "I'm gay!"
UNK: No, that guy moved.
Ross : - Can I bring her in? - Let her stay. It's sweet.
UNK: I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride!
Monica : No, I will not shut up, because I'm engaged!
UNK: Oh, big talk! Why don't you come here and say that to me?
Monica : Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.
UNK: You get her in, you bolt the door, I'll be in the closet.
UNK: The One with Monica's Thunder
Monica : ...and thank you for being here on my special night.
Monica : Our special night.
UNK: It just wouldn't be my night... Our night...
UNK: ...if you weren't here to celebrate with me... Us. Damn it!
UNK: It's okay, I want this to be your night too.
Ross : To Monica.
UNK: Come on, wait, stop it.
Monica : Okay, to Monica.
Phoebe : Have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because I'm kind of musical.
UNK: She got engaged a few hours ago, I doubt she's had time to think...
Phoebe : Speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
UNK: Yeah, you're on your own.
UNK: We should get dressed up and go have champagne at the Plaza.
UNK: I can't stay too long.
UNK: I gotta get up early for an audition. I gotta look good.
UNK: I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
UNK: What?
UNK: So when you said get up early, did you mean 1986?
UNK: You guys don't think I look 19?
Phoebe : Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.
UNK: Okay, everybody, let's go.
UNK: Is my candy bar around here?
Phoebe : No, you ate it all.
Joey : I was afraid of that.
UNK: You know what shoes would look great with this ring?
Monica : Diamond shoes.
UNK: You're not getting dressed.
Chandler : Know what I mean?
UNK: Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
UNK: There's gonna be a wedding.
