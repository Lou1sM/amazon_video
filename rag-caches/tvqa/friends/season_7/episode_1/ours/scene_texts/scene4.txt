Monica : Come on.
UNK: Why aren't you dressed yet?
UNK: I wrote the best song for your wedding.
Phoebe : Check this out.
UNK: If you get ready now, you can play.
Rachel : - Really?! - Yes.
UNK: That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.
UNK: But if you touch my guitar again, I'll have to pound on you a little bit.
UNK: Fair enough. Get ready. I'll get everybody.
Monica : Finally we can start celebrating my...
UNK: I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.
Ross : Okay, Monica, Mon. Okay, what you just saw...
Monica : Can I ask you just a little question? Why tonight?
UNK: I waited my whole life to be engaged...
Monica : ...and unlike some, I only plan on doing this once.
UNK: Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I hoped tonight could just be about that.
UNK: But it is just about that.
UNK: Now it's about you getting back together.
UNK: See, you kind of stole my thunder.
Ross : We did not steal your thunder. We are not getting back together.
Rachel : Yeah, no, and you know what? Nobody even saw.
UNK: That's true.
Rachel : - We just kissed. - It was just a kiss.
Phoebe : You guys kissed?!
Phoebe : What does this mean?!
UNK: Are you back together? Can I sing at your wedding?
Monica : Thunder being stolen.
UNK: - Phoebe, it's nothing. - Let's not make a big deal of this.
UNK: It was a one-time thing. It doesn't even matter.
Ross : Oh, my God.
Joey : I cannot believe you guys are talking about this.
Joey : Problems in the bedroom are between a man and a woman.
Joey : All right? Now, Chandler is doing the best he can.
UNK: I don't think that's what they were talking about.
UNK: No, but let's talk about it.
Phoebe : What a great night. Chandler can't do it, they kissed.
Ross : - What? - You guys kissed? This is huge.
UNK: No, it's not huge.
UNK: People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe...
Ross : ...we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't.
UNK: We're still talking about it.
UNK: That and Chandler's problem.
UNK: Monica, listen, listen.
UNK: Would you feel better if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel?
Monica : - That would be lovely. - You got it.
Joey : Now, I can pass for 19, right?
Chandler : Yes, you can pass for 19.
Rachel : - Really? - Yes.
Joey : - Seriously? - Seriously?
UNK: Seriously, no. Okay? You can play your own age, which is 31.
UNK: I'm 30!
UNK: Joey, you are not. You're 31.
UNK: Oh, crap!
UNK: So the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais? Maybe no more for you though.
UNK: You know, I think I don't feel like going to the Plaza.
Rachel : Monica, this is ridiculous.
UNK: I don't want to talk about it. I don't. Especially with you.
