UNK: And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.
UNK: It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : What is this drawing? I can't figure it out.
UNK: It's upside down, you gotta... It doesn't matter.
UNK: It's not like I don't have a sense of humor.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.
UNK: There's a time and a place.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Unless you have a limerick right now.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : No? Okay. Well, you've got my fax number.
UNK: I can't believe you did that. That was sweet.
UNK: - Don't worry about it. - You could've lost your job.
UNK: Are you kidding me? With this cute butt, I'd find work.
UNK: Thank you, you're great.
Monica : - You know what? - What?
Tag : I feel great.
Tag : In fact...
UNK: What?
UNK: It's just... It took me so long to get that desk organized.
UNK: I'm sorry.
Rachel : There it is.
Chandler : What is going on?
UNK: We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Joey : Yeah, lady, give us candy!
UNK: Joey!
UNK: - What's up, buddy? - What are you doing?
UNK: Waiting to get candy.
Chandler : Get in here.
UNK: Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.
Chandler : Merry Christmas.
UNK: The candy is coming! I need another 15 minutes for it to cool.
Chandler : All right, everybody, just be quiet. Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!
Chandler : What is the matter with you people?
Chandler : This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you, and look at her.
UNK: She is a mess.
UNK: Her hair's not brushed. She's got dark circles under her eyes...
UNK: ...chocolate on her face, and she is still stunning.
Chandler : She was making candy so she could get to know all of you.
UNK: And I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name.
Chandler : Am I right?
UNK: The Man : Candy Lady?
UNK: No, not "Candy Lady."
Joey : If we know it, can we have candy?
UNK: All right, you know what?
UNK: Forget it, you've ruined it.
UNK: Go home. You've ruined it.
UNK: That's all wrong! You guys ruined everything. You ruined it!
Rachel : - Thank you. - You're welcome.
Monica : Did you smoke?
Chandler : No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
Chandler : Are you okay?
UNK: Fine, but it was really scary for a while.
UNK: Someone slipped a threatening note under the door!
Joey : Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever.
UNK: I can't believe it. I did it. I rode a bike!
UNK: I never thought I'd be able to do that. Thank you.
UNK: Oh, hey, don't thank me. Thank yourself.
UNK: You're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them.
UNK: Don't be so corny, Ross. It's not an After School Special.
