UNK: - I'm ready. - You sure?
Chandler : Let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Ben : - Thanks, Daddy. - No, no. One daddy, two mommies.
UNK: - All right, it's all yours. - Okay, okay.
UNK: There you go, there you go.
UNK: Wow, Ben's first big-kid's bike. This is so exciting!
Monica : Oh, yeah, I remember mine.
Monica : It was my sixth birthday. I went to the park...
UNK: ...and I got on it, and it bent. - Yeah.
Phoebe : - I never had a bike of my own. - What?
UNK: We didn't have a lot of money.
Phoebe : But the girl across the street had the best bike.
UNK: It was pink, and it had rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handles...
Phoebe : ...and a bell and this big, white wicker basket...
Phoebe : ...with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Chandler : That sounds like my first bike.
Chandler : My dad gave me his old one.
Monica : - Did the girl ever let you ride it? - No.
Phoebe : But she gave me the box that it came in.
Phoebe : It had a picture of the bike on the front.
Phoebe : So I would sit on it, and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard.
Ross : That is so unfair.
Phoebe : Not really, I got to drag him around too.
UNK: Making candy for the neighbors.
UNK: I'm sorry, who?
UNK: I'm gonna hang a basket on the door.
Monica : When the neighbors walk by, they can take a piece.
UNK: - But we don't know the neighbors. - I do.
UNK: There's, let's see, the guy with the mustache...
Joey : ...smokes-a-lot lady, some kids I've seen...
Joey : ...and a red-haired guy who does not like to be called Rusty.
UNK: Oh, I know that guy. He also doesn't like it when you say :
UNK: "Back off, Howdy Doody. I'm engaged."
UNK: You got hit on by Firebeard?
Monica : See, this is exactly why I'm making this candy.
UNK: We can get to know our neighbors.
UNK: Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
UNK: Good morning!
UNK: - Somebody's in a good mood. - Well, why shouldn't I be?
Rachel : I have great friends. I have a wonderful job...
Monica : Where you can make out with your assistant.
UNK: It's not a big deal.
UNK: We stayed up all night creating a plan so that us dating won't be a problem.
UNK: Oh, yeah? What's the plan?
UNK: We... We are not...
Rachel : ...going to let it...
Rachel : ...be a problem.
Monica : It took you all night to come up with that plan?
UNK: Well, you know, we did other stuff too.
Monica : Did you two...?
UNK: Oh, I don't sleep with guys on the first date.
UNK: - Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise... - Anymore!
Rachel : Hi, Tag, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
UNK: - Yes, at 4. - Okay, thank you, that'll be all.
Rachel : Wait, wait.
Rachel : Did you see that? He had no idea...
Rachel : ...there was something going on between us.
UNK: - I'd better get back to my desk. - Okay, hard worker.
UNK: I'll put that in your evaluation.
Tag : - My what? - You've been here for two months now.
Rachel : And your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
UNK: But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
