UNK: Hey, there's some people outside asking about candy.
UNK: They'll just have to wait, won't they? I only got two hands!
Ross : - Need some help? - No, you don't know the system.
UNK: I don't need nobody messing with the system!
Ross : By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see a lot of me.
Phoebe : Oh, hello, liar.
UNK: Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
UNK: I could've been killed, you know.
Ross : I know, I know.
Ross : But can we please try it again?
Ross : I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.
Phoebe : Well, I would love to...
UNK: ...but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
UNK: [scene : - Phoebe. - What?
Phoebe : What the hell?
Monica : You know what?
UNK: If you won't learn how to ride, then I'm sorry...
UNK: ...I have to take it back. - What? Why?
UNK: Because it's...
UNK: It'd be like you having this guitar...
Ross : ...and never playing it.
Ross : Okay, this guitar wants to be played.
Ross : And this bike wants to be ridden.
UNK: And if you don't ride it...
UNK: ...you're killing its spirit.
Ben : The bike...
Ross : ...is dying.
Phoebe : All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Ross : Great, great.
UNK: You're making the bike very happy.
Phoebe : Okay, Ross.
UNK: Please don't die!
UNK: To get the evaluation before they see it...
UNK: ...we gotta get into Zelner's office. He doesn't get in until 10.
UNK: But his assistant, Betty, comes in early to eat breakfast at her desk.
UNK: - That's kind of sad. - Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.
Rachel : Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.
UNK: While I distract her, you go in.
Monica : - Got it. - Let's roll.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?
Rachel : Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner. For you? Anything. Minute.
UNK: Okay, great.
Rachel : Abort the plan.
UNK: Actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Well, can we get you anything, Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : No, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : So I read your evaluation of Tag.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Or to use his full name, Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Is something going on with you two?
Phoebe : Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was?
UNK: I mean, what would happen exactly?
UNK: Well, I'd be forced to file a report.
UNK: I'd have to consult with the legal department.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : And your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Phoebe : - Well... - Mr. Zelner...
UNK: I filled in that evaluation.
Phoebe : - Oh, no... - Yeah, yeah.
Tag : I thought it would be funny.
UNK: You wrote that you have a cute tushy?
Tag : Yes. I have a weird sense of humor.
