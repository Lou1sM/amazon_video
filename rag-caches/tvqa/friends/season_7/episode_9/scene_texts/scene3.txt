Ross : Just remember everything I taught you, and you'll be fine.
Ross : Okay? Here we go.
UNK: Ready, set...
Phoebe : Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.
Phoebe : Maybe before we start we should just get another one.
Phoebe : Perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair!
UNK: You can't get out of this. You have to learn how to ride a bike.
Phoebe : Why? Why do I have to learn?
UNK: - Well, in case of an emergency. - What kind of emergency?
UNK: Well, what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says :
UNK: "You ride this bike or I'll...
UNK: I'll shoot you."
Phoebe : I would ring the bell to distract him.
UNK: Then I would knock the gun away with a Chinese throwing star.
UNK: Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...
UNK: ...and, hey, I'll hold you up and push you. Okay?
UNK: You won't let go?
Ross : - No. - You swear?
Ross : I swear.
Chandler : - Okay. - Come on.
Ross : All right, here we go. All right?
Ross : - All right. - All right?
Ross : Feel good? All right, try pedaling.
UNK: That's it, you're doing great. Yes, take control.
Ross : Yes, yes, yes!
Phoebe : Oh, no!
Phoebe : You swore!
Ross : - I just thought you were doing so well. - I am shocked. Shocked!
UNK: It's a legitimate learning technique.
UNK: Wow.
