Joey : - Morning. - Hi.
Rachel : How was your date?
Joey : - Pretty good. - Oh, good.
UNK: My God. Sorry about that.
Joey : Okay, really good.
UNK: I gotta go. I'm late.
UNK: You're going to leave her with me?
UNK: Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.
UNK: Can you do me a favor?
UNK: Could you mention I'm not looking for a relationship? That'd be great.
Rachel : What, are you kidding?
UNK: Just casually slip it in, you know. Lay the groundwork.
UNK: Tell her I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.
UNK: She doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
UNK: That's a lot to remember.
UNK: Can't I tell her that you're a pig?
UNK: I'm gonna call her later myself.
UNK: Honest.
Joey : Chandler used to do it. He'd make her pancakes.
UNK: He'd make extras and leave them for me.
UNK: I'm not telling her anything. It's not my responsibility.
UNK: Fine.
UNK: Now, where did we land on those pancakes?
