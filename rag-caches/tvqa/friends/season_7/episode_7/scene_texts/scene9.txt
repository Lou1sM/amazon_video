Erin : - What about Benitez? - What about game one of the series?
Erin : - What about shut up? - You shut up.
Joey : I love arguing with her.
Joey : - Be right back. - Okay.
UNK: So how's the second-greatest love affair of the century?
UNK: Second? Who's the first?
UNK: Me and this muffin. My God, it's delicious.
UNK: How's it going with Joey?
UNK: Oh, okay.
UNK: Okay?
Rachel : Tell me that you like him, please. I mean, tell me that you like him.
UNK: He's a really great guy, and I know you really want this to work out...
UNK: ...but I just don't see this having a future.
Rachel : But you said that you liked him. What happened?
UNK: Did you just change your mind?
Phoebe : - Kind of. - Then change it back!
UNK: I'm sorry. It's just, there's no real spark.
UNK: Didn't you sleep together?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Tramp.
Phoebe : Does Joey have any idea?
UNK: I don't think he does. You know what?
UNK: Maybe you could tell him I'm not interested...
Erin : ...in a serious relationship.
Phoebe : You mean, like, that you're kind of a loner?
Erin : Yeah, that'd be great.
UNK: - And maybe that you're a real stronzo. - I'm sorry?
