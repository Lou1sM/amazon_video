UNK: I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
UNK: - Hey. Want to go? - Yeah, let's go.
Joey : - Okay. See you guys later. - Bye, guys.
Joey : Hey, thank you so much.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: I guess it wasn't cupid that brought her here.
Phoebe : No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Ross : Yes, yes? How can I help you?
Guy : We were just looking around.
UNK: Oh, you're fellow scholars.
Ross : What exactly were you looking for?
UNK: Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...
UNK: ...on the Smilodon californicus?
Ross : Get out of here!
Ross : Meeting someone?
Ross : Or are you just here to brush up...
UNK: ...on Merriam's views on evolution?
UNK: Actually, I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
UNK: I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
UNK: I'm sorry. Who are you?
UNK: I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.
Woman : Ross Geller? Why do I know that name? It's a...
UNK: Wait.
Woman : Did you write this?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: You're the person who checked out my book?
UNK: You know, you look nothing like I would have thought.
UNK: You're so young.
UNK: Well, I skipped fourth grade.
UNK: I am very, very sorry.
UNK: - So how was your date? - Great. We walked around the Village.
UNK: We went to this ice-cream place. Split a milk shake.
UNK: Seventy-thirty, but still.
UNK: I'm thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Phoebe : Really? She said she wants to go?
UNK: No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky because she's busy at work.
UNK: - She said that? - Yes.
UNK: Joey, don't you think maybe it's kind of quick...
UNK: ...for you to be going away together on a trip?
UNK: Not for me. No, I want to spend as much time with her as I can.
UNK: Okay, honey. Joey, we need to talk, okay?
UNK: I got the feeling from her...
UNK: ...that she's not looking for a serious relationship.
UNK: - Where are you getting this? - She told me.
UNK: She said she's kind of a loner.
UNK: [scene : - Joey... - Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.
UNK: I'm a loner too, right?
UNK: Hey, Joey. You know what? You are way too good for her.
UNK: I promise, next time I will tell them you're not looking for a relationship.
UNK: No, don't do that. Just...
UNK: - Next time, make sure she likes me. - Well, that too.
UNK: Joey?
Rachel : - Do you want some pancakes? - Finally.
Monica : What are we gonna do?
UNK: I say we go with "Careless Whisper."
UNK: Chandler?
Chandler : Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
UNK: Janice, what are you doing here?
UNK: I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment...
