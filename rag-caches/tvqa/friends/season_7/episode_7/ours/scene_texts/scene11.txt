UNK: ...but I just felt like I really couldn't be alone tonight.
UNK: I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you.
UNK: Just, I really feel like I need to be with family.
Monica : Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice, aren't they?
UNK: Please. Because otherwise, I really don't know what I might do.
UNK: Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?
Janice : - Do you have any tissues? - Yeah, in the bathroom.
UNK: We'll just let her stay.
Chandler : No. If we let her stay, she will stay forever.
UNK: - Kind of like your Barcalounger. - Is that what you're thinking about?
Monica : I never stop thinking about it.
UNK: - What are we going to do? - Nothing. We'll just have to let her stay.
UNK: We can't. We gotta fight!
UNK: Fight!
UNK: Chandler, she has beaten me.
UNK: I'm tired, Chandler.
UNK: So very tired!
Janice : Hey, you guys?
Janice : Do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath?
UNK: Janice, I'm sorry...
UNK: ...but you can't stay here tonight.
Janice : Why not?
UNK: Honestly?
Chandler : Our apartment is a hotbed...
Chandler : ...for electromagnetic activity.
Chandler : Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly...
Chandler : ...you have not.
UNK: I'm gonna need a comforter.
UNK: Do you have a hypoallergenic one? Because otherwise I get very nasal.
Janice : Do you have a cat? Because it's already happening.
UNK: Do you hear that? Listen.
Monica : Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You have to go.
UNK: Why?
Monica : Because Chandler still has feelings for you.
Joey : He does?
Chandler : Say again?
UNK: That's right. That's right.
UNK: And that is why you can't stay here tonight.
UNK: And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Chandler : Feelings. Such strong feelings.
Monica : I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away...
Monica : ...but you can.
Monica : Oh, my God.
UNK: I understand. I am so sorry.
UNK: I'll go.
Janice : Goodbye, Monica.
Janice : I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
UNK: Chandler.
Janice : You call me when this goes in the pooper.
UNK: I got this section covered.
UNK: Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby to shine in people's eye...
Ross : Okay, see you later.
Chandler : I just wanted to show Monica your book.
