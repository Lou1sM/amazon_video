Rachel : Oh, my Joey.
UNK: Please don't get married before I do.
Janice : I just cannot believe that Clark stood me up.
UNK: He may still show up.
Janice : What are you, stupid?
UNK: - It's been three hours. - Is that all?
UNK: I just feel like such a fool. I thought this guy was my soul mate.
UNK: I thought I was your soul mate.
UNK: What am I doing?
UNK: You know, let's just... Oh, let's forget about Clark.
UNK: Let's go on to happier things.
UNK: Why don't you tell me about your lovely wedding.
UNK: There was something that we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
UNK: It's going to be a small ceremony.
UNK: Tiny.
UNK: We're not even sure why we're having it.
UNK: It's actually going to be just family.
UNK: Oh, wait.
Janice : You two think of me as family?
Janice : I have to ask you something now, and be honest.
Janice : Do you want me to sing "Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?
Joey : How can you say that? The Mets have no closer.
