UNK: Hey, what's up?
UNK: Hey, who's your friend?
Erin : - Hey, Joey. - Erin.
UNK: You're still here.
Rachel : We ended up spending the day together and had such a great time.
UNK: Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.
UNK: And then there's you guys.
UNK: Well, listen, I better get going.
Erin : Today was great. Thanks.
UNK: And, Joey, last night was fun.
UNK: Yeah. I'll call you.
UNK: - I'll call you too. - Or I'll call you.
Phoebe : - And call me. - Okay.
UNK: Look at that, we're all gonna call each other.
Joey : Good to see you again.
Joey : - Bye-bye. - Bye.
UNK: The system kind of broke down, huh?
UNK: Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't tell her all those things.
UNK: And we got to talking, and I...
Phoebe : We want you to marry her.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : She is so amazing. You have no idea.
Joey : Who do you think brought her here?
UNK: Cupid.
UNK: She's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Joey : Man, do you know what guys want.
UNK: Come on, she's so perfect for you. She's sweet.
Rachel : She likes baseball. She had two beers at lunch.
Joey : My beers?!
UNK: Look, she's a very nice girl.
UNK: We had a very good time, but I don't see it going anywhere.
Phoebe : You always say that.
UNK: Maybe if you gave her a chance, it would go somewhere.
UNK: I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.
Phoebe : - Whatever. - Fine.
UNK: Hey, don't start judging me.
UNK: You're in love with your assistant.
UNK: You're having an affair with the guy who keeps pigeons on the roof.
UNK: Phoebe!
Phoebe : Secret affair.
UNK: What did I say?
UNK: Hey, cutie-cutie.
UNK: So I ran into someone you know today at work.
UNK: Oh, yeah? Who was it?
Monica : Oh, my God.
Chandler : I am so sorry, sweetie.
Chandler : Are you okay?
UNK: You didn't tell her we're engaged?
Monica : - She saw the ring. - Did she freak out?
Monica : She was shocked, but then again, so were most people.
UNK: She actually has a boyfriend herself.
UNK: Name's Clark.
UNK: She also invited herself to our wedding.
Monica : Clark too.
Chandler : You said no, right?
Chandler : You said no, right?
UNK: She cornered me. She asked me if the wedding was in town.
Monica : - What was I supposed to do? - Lie.
Chandler : How hard is that? "Your check's in the mail."
UNK: "Oh, your baby's so cute."
UNK: "I can't wait to read your book, Ross."
Monica : So she comes to the wedding. Maybe it won't be so bad.
UNK: Think she'll sit quietly? Think she'll want to make a toast?
UNK: You don't think she'll want to sing "Part-Time Lover"?
UNK: Oh, my God. She's not gonna like the chicken either, is she?
UNK: You know what? Lt'll be okay.
UNK: She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Joey : - Really? - No, that was a lie.
