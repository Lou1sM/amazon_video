UNK: Hi.
UNK: What's wrong?
Ross : People are doing it in front of my book.
UNK: I'm sorry?
Ross : My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school. I went to see it.
UNK: And there were students making babies right in the paleontology section.
Monica : Oh, my God. Did you get to see anything good?
UNK: - That's not the point. - I know that's not the point.
UNK: I'm trying to make it the point.
Ross : At your school...
UNK: ...was there a place on campus where students went to fool around?
Rachel : Yeah, there was.
UNK: In the corner of the library where all the books were that nobody ever read.
Rachel : Yes, there was.
Ross : Great, because people kept showing up. I think it's like a thing.
Joey : Hold on a second.
Joey : Fifth floor, against that back wall?
UNK: Oh, for crying out loud!
Joey : - So we should go catch our movie. - What's the rush?
Joey : I like to see the previews.
Joey : The candy.
Phoebe : - Oh, hey. - Well, look who's here.
Erin : - Hey, Joey. - Hey, Erin.
Erin : - Hey, Rachel. - Hi.
UNK: We were about to take off and see a movie.
Rachel : - Oh, no! - What's wrong?
Rachel : Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Rachel : Oh, no.
Joey : What party?
UNK: - A birthday party. - A birthday party.
UNK: Whose birthday party?
UNK: - Alison's birthday party. - Alison's birthday party.
Joey : And how old is Alison?
UNK: - Thirty-two. - Thirty-two.
UNK: - I feel so terrible ditching you like this. - No, that's okay.
Rachel : Wait a minute. Why don't you guys do something?
Joey : Look how that worked out.
UNK: - You want to catch a movie? - Yeah, sure. That will be fun.
UNK: Guess I'll talk to you guys after Alison's party.
UNK: - That, actually, might go late. - I'll wait up.
UNK: Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.
Ross : Do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
UNK: The Librarian : Well, yes. Just give me five minutes.
UNK: The Librarian : I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
Ross : No, no, no.
Ross : Can I speak to someone in charge?
UNK: The Head Librarian : How can I help?
UNK: Hi, I was wondering, is it possible to increase security...
Ross : ...in the paleontology section?
UNK: I wrote a book that's up there.
Ross : And instead of reading it, people are...
UNK: Well, they're rolling around in front of it.
UNK: The Head Librarian : We are aware of the problem you're referring to.
UNK: The Head Librarian : As far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library's understaffed.
UNK: I can't help you.
Monica : Well, fine.
UNK: If I'm the only person with any appreciation...
Ross : ...of the sanctity of the written word, then I'll go defend it myself.
UNK: Don't you follow me.
Rachel : - How did it go with Erin? - Unbelievable.
Joey : We had the best time.
UNK: - So you're not mad anymore? - No, no. You guys were totally right.
UNK: This was much better than the first date.
UNK: That was awkward. We were both nervous.
UNK: - Didn't you sleep together? - Yeah, that calms me down.
Joey : And we have so much in common.
Joey : She loves sandwiches, sports. Although she is a Met fan.
UNK: Not an issue now, but if we had kids...
UNK: Oh, my God! Listen to you talking about having kids.
