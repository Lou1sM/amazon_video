UNK: I still don't get it.
Monica : You still awake?
Ross : Yeah. You?
Monica : You do know that was me that just said that, right?
UNK: Hey.
UNK: As long as we're both up...
UNK: Yeah?
UNK: I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
UNK: Man, I'm starving. What the hell was I thinking at dinner?
Joey : "Do you want soup or salad?" Both, always order both.
UNK: You know, I'm looking, and I don't think anyone's home here.
Ross : I say we just break the window...
Ross : ...crawl through...
UNK: ...and you know, explain later.
UNK: - No one's home? - I don't think so.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: So when you get in there...
Phoebe : Okay. This is where you and I part ways.
Phoebe : Noisy bitch!
UNK: Oh, what? What are you doing?
Chandler : Do you know what just happened?
UNK: Yeah. We had sex, and then we fell asleep.
Chandler : No. We were in the middle of sex...
Chandler : ...and you fell asleep.
UNK: No. No, that's not true.
Monica : No, best time ever.
UNK: Yeah. You rock my world.
Joey : - Monica? - What?
Chandler : I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it.
Chandler : So please wake up so we can do it right.
UNK: Okay. Okay. I'm ready.
Monica : - Come on, big fella. - Okay.
Monica : - Give me the good stuff. - Yeah.
UNK: No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.
UNK: Okay, I'm going to make you some coffee.
UNK: Well, I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
UNK: Okay, I'm up. I'm up.
Rachel : Hi. I got you some coffee to...
UNK: So you got anything for me?
Tag : - Still no luck. - Oh, my God.
UNK: You checked your entire desk and all the drawers?
Tag : - Want me to check again? - I wish you would.
UNK: Well, no, it's not in there.
Rachel : How about that drawer?
UNK: Well, it's not out here. Any chance it could be in your office?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: I mean, let me check.
Tag : Any luck?
Rachel : See you in my office for a minute?
Tag : You found them!
UNK: I'm not even gonna gloat.
UNK: - I'm just really relieved that this whole... - You put these on my desk.
Tag : - I did not. - Oh, really?
UNK: They slid out of your bottom drawer...
Rachel : ...crawled across the floor, then jumped onto my desk?
