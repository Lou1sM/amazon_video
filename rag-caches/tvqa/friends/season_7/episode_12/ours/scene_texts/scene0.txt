UNK: Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Ross : Well, technically, it started 7 billion years ago.
UNK: Okay. Fine, I'll stop. No teaching, okay?
UNK: We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.
UNK: Okay?
UNK: Whose official name is Bapstein-King. Okay! Okay!
Phoebe : There it is. Oh, look at that!
UNK: Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
UNK: That's a plane.
Phoebe : Well, all right, 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high...
UNK: ...that's pretty amazing too.
Tag : - I wonder if you can see my apartment. - No, you can't.
Tag : - What? - I don't know.
Ross : Man, look at all those stars.
Ross : Infinite space. It really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Joey : - Know what else makes you wonder? - What?
UNK: Check out the rack on that chick.
UNK: You think those babies are real?
UNK: The One Where They're Up All Night
UNK: No, I'm not.
Joey : Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
UNK: Because it's flattering!
Chandler : Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.
UNK: - We're gonna take off too. Rented a movie. - I won't say no to a movie.
UNK: Oh, Pheebs, we just actually wanted to be alone.
Phoebe : - Get me out of here. - Oh, okay.
UNK: - Hey, Ross. - What?
Joey : - Check this out. - Is it the comet?
UNK: No. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
UNK: I can't believe...
Ross : I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet...
UNK: ...one of nature's most spectacular phenomena...
Ross : ...and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and some woman.
UNK: You know, there's two women, dude.
Ross : Show me where.
UNK: Okay. Right up here.
UNK: Joey, where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
UNK: I don't know.
Joey : Yeah, I do.
Rachel : - Joey! - What? Hey, don't look at me!
UNK: You wanted to come up here and look for some stupid Burger King comet.
UNK: It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?
Ross : Hey, Bapstein was a very well-respected astronomer from...
UNK: No!
Joey : - Monica. - She's sleeping.
UNK: I know. Just a quick question.
Chandler : Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Monica : Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duvall.
UNK: Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
UNK: Sorry, I just can't sleep.
UNK: Where's that book you're reading with two women who are ice-skating...
UNK: ...and wearing those hats with the flowers on it.
Chandler : Because every time I look at that cover, I'm like...
UNK: It's in the living room, where there's also a light...
Monica : ...and no one will kick you in the shin.
UNK: What?
UNK: Please don't be a spaceship. Please don't be a spaceship.
Phoebe : Oh, thank God.
