Phoebe : ...is connected to this wire, which plugs into here.
Phoebe : Okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all I have to do...
Phoebe : Well done, Pheebs.
Phoebe : What do you want from me?!
UNK: Here's your milk. What do you wanna talk about?
Chandler : What? What? What?
UNK: Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
UNK: Oh, that's so much better. Okay.
UNK: At least I can hear myself think.
UNK: God, stop singing.
UNK: Stop singing!
Tag : Okay. Feel free to look...
UNK: ...but I'm telling you, those contracts are not on this desk.
UNK: How could you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag.
UNK: This is what I'm talking about. You have to be more organized.
UNK: You've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you... Oh!
UNK: And who's this chippy?
UNK: A little young for you, but whatever.
UNK: That's my sister.
UNK: Really? Very cute braces.
UNK: Anyway, you know what? The point is, Tag, start looking...
UNK: ...because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk.
Tag : So when do you imagine you gave them to me? Morning or afternoon?
Rachel : In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch...
Rachel : ...he put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it...
UNK: ...that said :
Rachel : "Must go out today."
Rachel : So you just keep looking in there, all right?
UNK: They're not here.
UNK: Puzzler.
Rachel : Bit of a puzzle.
UNK: Why don't you check the copy room. Maybe you left the contracts in there.
UNK: - How could I have left them there? - I don't know.
Rachel : How can your genitals make phone calls?
UNK: Okay? It's not a perfect world. Just go, please?
Ross : - Fine. - Thank you.
UNK: Hello?
