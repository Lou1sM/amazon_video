UNK: Oh, hi, Officer Fireman. Can I help you?
UNK: The Fireman : We found your fire alarm in the trash.
UNK: - That's not mine. - Yes, it is.

UNK: ...don't use a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica."
Phoebe : Do you have a search warrant?
Phoebe : Because the last time I checked, this was still America.

UNK: - Okay, here I come. - All right.
UNK: Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?

Joey : When we talked about face to face...
UNK: ...I don't think we thought it all the way through.

Monica : - Hi. - Hi.
UNK: You know, maybe I should hang, and you should climb down me.
Joey : Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
