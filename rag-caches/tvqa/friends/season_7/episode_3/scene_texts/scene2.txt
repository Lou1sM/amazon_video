Phoebe : That was the one legacy my grandmother left me.
Phoebe : And I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Ross : We have to get you an engagement present?
UNK: Don't worry about it.
Ross : No one got me an engagement present.
UNK: I don't have the recipe, but here.
Phoebe : I wish you health and happiness.
Chandler : An old cookie?
Monica : This is what happens when you don't register for gifts.
UNK: I made a batch and froze it. This is the only one left.
UNK: We can't accept this.
Phoebe : Why not?
UNK: Because it's gross.
Monica : No, wait. I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie.
UNK: I do this at work all the time.
Rachel : - Really? - I think so!
UNK: Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.
UNK: Two! I've been engaged twice.
Joey : Look at this clown.
Joey : He thinks he can take up the whole river.
Joey : Get out of the way, jackass!
UNK: Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway?
Rachel : That is the Coast Guard.
UNK: What are they doing here?
UNK: The coast is all the way over there.
Rachel : Joey, just ignore the boats.
UNK: - We're not finished with our lesson. - All right.
UNK: I'm gonna go over the basic points once more.
UNK: Come on, Rach. I got it, okay?
Joey : I want to go over there...
Joey : ...where that boatload of girls is.
UNK: Is that it? You want to give...
UNK: ...a shout out to the hot chicas?
UNK: Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.
UNK: Quick question, though : What's this called?
Joey : - Boat rope? - Wrong!
Rachel : How do you get the mainsail up?
Joey : Rub it?
Rachel : No. What do you do if I say we're coming about?
UNK: I say, "Come again?"
Joey : I know this one. I know this one.
UNK: Time's up. Now you're dead.
Joey : And deaf!
UNK: You go on and make your little jokes.
UNK: If you don't know what you're doing...
Rachel : ...you will die. Am I getting through to you?
Joey : - Yes. - Don't just say yes.
UNK: This isn't a game. You could get hurt out here!
Rachel : Do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die?
Joey : I want to make a ship-to-shore call to Chandler.
Monica : - I definitely taste nutmeg. - You do?
UNK: You don't? Well, that's the difference...
Monica : ...between a professional and a layman.
Phoebe : That and arrogance.
UNK: Hey.
Monica : Hey. How was sailing?
