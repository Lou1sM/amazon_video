Joey : I did learn.
Rachel : - Really? - Yeah, come on.
UNK: It's okay.
Joey : I know what a mainsail is.
Joey : I know to duck when the boom comes across.
Joey : - I know port is right. - Left.
UNK: Damn it!
UNK: What are we gonna do with all these cookies?
UNK: Joey.
UNK: It would make my grandmother happy...
UNK: ...that we're trying to figure out her recipe.
UNK: I bet she's looking up at us and smiling right now.
Ross : Looking up?
Phoebe : She was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
UNK: Well, I've tried everything.
Monica : I give up. I'm not gonna be the mom...
UNK: ...who makes the world's best cookies.
Monica : I do make the best duck confit with broccoli raab.
Monica : Kids love that, right?
UNK: Isn't there any relative that has the recipe?
Ross : What about your sister?
Phoebe : No. I made a promise to myself that the next time...
Phoebe : ...I would talk to Ursula is over my dead body.
UNK: And that's not happening till October 15, 2032.
UNK: That's the day you're gonna die?
UNK: I've got shuffleboard that day.
UNK: That's what you think.
UNK: What about friends of your grandma? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Phoebe : I may have relatives in France who would know.
UNK: My grandmother said she got it from her grandmother, "Nestley Toulouse."
Monica : What was her name?
UNK: Nestley Toulouse.
Phoebe : You Americans always butcher the French language.
Monica : Phoebe, is this the recipe?
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Oh.
UNK: I cannot believe that I spent...
UNK: ...two days figuring out that recipe.
UNK: It was here the whole time!
Phoebe : I know! You see, it is stuff like this...
Phoebe : ...which is why you're burning in hell!
Chandler : So you understand.
UNK: I'd feel better if you didn't tell what happened.
UNK: I'm a little embarrassed about it.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I understand completely.
UNK: Nothing's scarier than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws.
UNK: Mr. Geller : As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy, I was unemployed.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Her father asked me what I did for a living.
UNK: I said I was a lawyer.
UNK: - What'd you do when they found out? - They never did.
UNK: Mr. Geller : So if you ever see me giving them legal advice, just nod along.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Shall we?
Chandler : So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.
Rachel : Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...
Rachel : ...your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
UNK: Why don't you give a pull on that rope?
UNK: We're not sailing.
Joey : - Just pull on it. - All right.
UNK: Sandwiches!
Joey : What else?
Rachel : Here you go.
Ross : - Thank you. - Oh, wow.
Ross : - What are you doing? - Sorry.
UNK: Not like that. You're letting all the good stuff fall out.
UNK: Careful! You're wasting good pastrami!
UNK: Oh, my God. I'm my dad!
