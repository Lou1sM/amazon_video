UNK: Here's batch 22. Maybe these are like your grandma's.
UNK: This has a bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
UNK: Let's give it a shot.
UNK: I haven't made so many cookies since 9th grade.
UNK: What for, a bake sale?
Monica : No, just a Friday night.
Ross : These are pretty good.
Phoebe : Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Ross : Which one was that?
UNK: The ones we had after you almost threw up.
Ross : Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.
Ross : I did not like batch 16.
UNK: I'm okay.
Phoebe : Any more from the good batch? We could work off those.
UNK: I think there's one left.
Ross : Batch 16. Sixteen, people, get out of the way!
UNK: Okay, Joey. You're doing really good.
UNK: I just need you to step to the portside.
UNK: Remember talking about the portside?
Ross : Oh, yeah.
UNK: No.
UNK: It's left, sweetie, but that's okay. That's a tough one.
UNK: Why not just say left?
Rachel : Okay, go to the left.
Rachel : The left.
Rachel : Just sit over there!
UNK: You're yelling again. See that?
UNK: Oh, no, no. Very quiet. Said with love, no yelling.
UNK: You know what? Since I'm here, I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.
UNK: See what I did there?
UNK: We're luffing a little. Can you tighten up the Cunningham?
Joey : You just said a bunch of stuff I don't know.
Rachel : Joey, come on! We just went over this.
UNK: We did that when that bird...
UNK: ...flew over with the fish in his mouth.
Joey : Did you see it? It was gross.
UNK: I did not see the bird or the fish!
Rachel : I did not see the piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!
Rachel : I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.
Rachel : Which obviously is an impossible thing to do.
UNK: You're yelling, and I don't see you taking your top off.
Joey : I quit!
UNK: - What do you mean? You can't quit. - Why not?
UNK: You're not finished! I won't have it. Greens do not quit.
UNK: Greens?
UNK: I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.
Monica : Oh, my God.
UNK: I just said, "Greens don't quit," didn't I?
UNK: Did I say, "Greens don't quit"?
UNK: Yes! And you're still yelling at me.
UNK: No, I'm not yelling at you. I'm just yelling near you.
UNK: Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father.
Rachel : Oh, my God. This is horrible.
UNK: I try so hard not to be my mother, I didn't see this coming.
UNK: I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
