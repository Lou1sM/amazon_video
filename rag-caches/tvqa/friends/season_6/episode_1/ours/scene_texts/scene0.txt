UNK: Okay, this is it.
UNK: You sure you wanna do this?
UNK: Hello, Mrs. Ross.
UNK: Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.
UNK: -Whoa! -Oh, my God!
UNK: Come on, Phoebe, hurry!
Phoebe : Okay! Okay!
Chandler : Oh, my God! Is everybody getting married?
Attendant : No running in the chapel.
UNK: Hey, don't you give me any of your.. Hey!
UNK: Why are you here?
UNK: Ross and Rachel left a message. They're getting married.
UNK: -Isn't that why you guys are here? -Yes. Why else would we be here?
Joey : What happened? Did we miss it?
UNK: We missed it.
UNK: Maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel!
UNK: I can't believe they got married.
UNK: I know! I didn't even know they were dating.
UNK: I don't think they're as much dating as they are...
UNK: ...two bottles of vodka walking around in human form.
Monica : This is insane.
UNK: What's the big deal? It's not like it's a real marriage.
UNK: What?
UNK: If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
UNK: If you marry here, you're married everywhere.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Yeah.
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: Oh, well.
Ross : Why are we in bed together?
UNK: I don't know.
Joey : -Did we? -I don't know.
Rachel : Do you have any clothes on?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: -Really? -No.
UNK: But we didn't have..
UNK: ...sex, did we?
UNK: I don't remember much about last night.
Ross : It was such a blur.
Rachel : I remember laughing. I laughed a lot.
UNK: Then we didn't have sex.
UNK: Well, so, what did we do last night?
UNK: I don't know, but I think it was a lot of fun.
UNK: Luckily, not too much fun, right?
UNK: -I don't think so. -Oh, thank God.
UNK: Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.
UNK: I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Ross : Tell me about it.
UNK: Morning, Phoebe.
UNK: Well, my movie has been officially canceled.
UNK: Joey, I'm so sorry.
UNK: You want my breakfast?
Joey : Too depressed to eat.
UNK: I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.
UNK: I'll fly home with you. What time is your flight?
Phoebe : -What about my cab? -I don't need that anymore.
