Chandler : I know I love you.
Chandler : Where are we on the whole "going back...
UNK: to where they have the marriages" thing? I love you.
UNK: That's a good question.
Monica : Last night we let the dice decide.
Monica : We should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
UNK: We don't get married unless there's a sign.
Chandler : So say...
Chandler : you roll another eight, then there's a sign...
UNK: that we should marry.
Monica : Eight we get married...
Monica : but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married.
Chandler : Sounds great.
UNK: Hey, we got a shooter.
Croupler : Money, please.
UNK: -Ready? -Ready.
Monica : Come on, eight.
Chandler : Yes, yes, eight.
Croupler : Eight, easy eight.
UNK: -I can't believe I rolled an eight. -That was so unlikely.
UNK: Let's get married.
Joey : I guess.
Monica : Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Chandler : It was the wrong kind of eight. No wedding! Damn it!
Monica : I wanted it so bad!
Monica : Wanna go pack?
UNK: We're doing the right thing.
Monica : Of course we are.
Monica : We left it up to fate.
Monica : If we were supposed to get married, there would be a sign.
Phoebe : Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.
