UNK: Come on, Joey. You can't win if you don't ask any questions!
UNK: -What? -You promised me a fun road trip.
UNK: We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.
UNK: We are switching, and you are going to drive back.
Phoebe : That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
Phoebe : All right.
Phoebe : And until then, you are going to sing to me...
UNK: ...because the radio's broken and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.
UNK: -Really? -Sing!
UNK: I wanna rock 'n' roll all night
Joey : Man, this is a long drive.
