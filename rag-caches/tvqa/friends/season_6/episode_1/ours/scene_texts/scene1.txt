Phoebe : You borrowed my cab. You have to drive it back.
UNK: I don't wanna drive back by myself. I get lonely.
UNK: How about if you come with me?
UNK: -It's a long trip. -That would be great.
Joey : We could talk and play games.
Joey : This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.
Phoebe : Are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"?
UNK: Sure?
UNK: All right. Although, I don't think we need one. I never stopped loving you.
UNK: So has anybody talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Phoebe : They left me a message. They'll be here.
UNK: Where is the waitress? I'm starving.
UNK: It's a buffet, man.
UNK: Here's where I win all my money back!
Chandler : I gotta talk to you.
UNK: Sure.
UNK: What's up?
Chandler : Monica and I almost got married.
Chandler : My God!
UNK: That's huge!
UNK: Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?
UNK: And who was gonna be your best man? Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.
UNK: I just don't think that Monica and I are ready yet. I love her...
Chandler : ...but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel...
UNK: ...was like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast, you know.
Chandler : How do I tell her without crushing her?
UNK: Tell her she's not marriage material.
UNK: What?
Joey : Girls say it to me all the time.
UNK: And if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
UNK: How do I tell him that it's too soon?
UNK: He's gonna think I don't love him anymore.
UNK: -Well, you don't. -Yes, I do.
Phoebe : Good. I was just testing you.
UNK: -Hey. -Oh, hi.
Monica : We were just talking about bacon.
Phoebe : No, we were talking about tennis.
Phoebe : Tennis is more believable.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: Coffee.
UNK: What?
Chandler : Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night?
UNK: What do you mean "last night"? Nothing happened last night.
Phoebe : Ross invited us all to watch.
UNK: What is the matter with you?
UNK: We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married.
Rachel : Who got married?
Chandler : You did.
UNK: What?
UNK: -Hello. We didn't get married. -No, we didn't. That's ridi..
UNK: Wait, wait, wait. I remember being in a chapel.
Ross : They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.
Joey : They let you get married.
UNK: Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.
UNK: Now, I'm drunk right now.
UNK: I can't have a mimosa with breakfast? I'm on vacation.
UNK: What are you gonna do?
UNK: Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer.
Chandler : Well, I think.. I think Ross already has one.
UNK: Yeah, that guy's finally gonna be able to put in that pool.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two.
UNK: Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...
UNK: ...because we don't need to get divorced.
UNK: -We're just gonna get an annulment. -An annulment?
UNK: Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.
UNK: Oh, that's your thing!
UNK: What?
UNK: Your thing. You're the guy who gets divorced.
UNK: No, no, that's not "my thing."
Ross : I do not love getting divorced.
Phoebe : Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.
Phoebe : You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it...
UNK: ...and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it.
UNK: I'm so drunk.
UNK: -You wanna play some Pai Gow? -Maybe.
UNK: But I kind of think we should talk about last night.
UNK: That's a good idea. I wanna talk about last night too...
UNK: -and I don't know what Pai Gow is. -I see.
UNK: -So what should we do? -I don't know.
Chandler : I know I love you.
