Chandler : Me asking is kind of a sign.
UNK: Yes! Yes! Yes!
Monica : Okay. Okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
UNK: Here's your key. Here's your key.
UNK: Now go out and christen it!
Monica : Go out and come back in!
UNK: Door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay.
UNK: -Ready? -Ready!
Chandler : The key broke in the lock, and I can't get in.
UNK: Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!
UNK: -This isn't a sign! -No, it's a very old key!
UNK: -It's an old key! -Oh, my God, it's old!
Chandler : I love you.
Chandler : I love you.
Chandler : Are you hugging the door right now?
UNK: No.
UNK: Yeah, yeah, me neither.
Rachel : So did everything go all right with the annulment?
Ross : Oh, yeah. No problems. It's all taken care of.
Rachel : Ross, thank you.
UNK: Do you wanna go see a movie?
Ross : -Yeah, why not? -Phoebe?
Phoebe : No, thanks. I've already seen one.
UNK: Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Ross : You wanna hear something weird?
UNK: Always.
UNK: I didn't get the annulment.
UNK: What?
UNK: We're still married.
UNK: Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Joey : What are you doing?
UNK: Key is stuck in the lock.
Joey : I can fix it. Hold on.
UNK: Watch out, watch out.
UNK: It still doesn't work.
UNK: I'm not finished.
Chandler : Nice job, Joe. You're quite the craftsman!
