UNK: Now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
UNK: I'm not kidding.
UNK: Look...
UNK: ...I can't have three failed marriages.
UNK: I can't, okay?
Ross : I am not gonna be that guy.
UNK: Okay? No, no. That is not gonna be "my thing."
UNK: So, what, we just stay married forever?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: I mean, I haven't worked it all out yet, but...
UNK: Okay, I know it's a bit crazy..
UNK: How is this going to affect you, really?
Ross : I mean, you fill some form out once in a while...
UNK: instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs."
UNK: It's right next to it.
UNK: Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. You know what?
UNK: We can stay married...
UNK: because I thought that the boxes were far away from each other.
UNK: -No, they're right.. -Ross!
Phoebe : All right. Just...
Rachel : please take a moment here...
Rachel : and think about what you're asking of me. Okay?
UNK: I am asking you to do me a favor.
Rachel : You are asking me to be your wife.
Ross : And as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.
UNK: We did make vows.
UNK: That kid kicked me really hard.
Chandler : Well, you did pull his hair.
Monica : -He took my snack. -I'm not getting into this again.
UNK: All right, you know what? Hurts really bad.
Chandler : Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
UNK: There. There. Okay.
UNK: -This doesn't mean anything, does it? -No.
Phoebe : How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
UNK: He could be a rap.. He could be a rapist or a killer or something.
UNK: Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
UNK: I'm not talking to you. You go back to sleep.
Phoebe : -And, you, are you a rapist? -No.
Phoebe : Do you like car games?
UNK: Yeah, you know the license plate game?
Phoebe : I love the license plate game!
UNK: I'll play. I'll play.
Phoebe : No, you need your sleep. Night-night.
Ross : Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me...
Ross : but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married.
Ross : We register...
Ross : and you get to keep all the presents.
Rachel : No, Ross, come on. No, listen.
UNK: I've thought about how to tell you this.
UNK: I came up with an analogy about a little goldfish...
UNK: in a pond that freezes over in the winter...
UNK: but I realized that was a story about what to do when people pick on you.
UNK: So I'm gonna actually save that for my children's book.
UNK: -What's up? -Oh, sorry.
Rachel : The bottom line, Ross...
UNK: is we cannot stay married.
UNK: -I don't know if that's true.. -Oh, but it is.
UNK: Okay. You know what this is?
Ross : This is a difference of opinion.
Ross : -When that happens in a marriage.. -Ross, come on!
Rachel : This is not a marriage! This is the world's worst hangover!
Rachel : Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will.
Phoebe : All right. All right, I'll do it.
Rachel : Thank you.
Chandler : Hey, hey...
Rachel : is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
UNK: There's the train station. This is where I get off.
Hitchhiker : I have your address and phone number.
Phoebe : I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter.
