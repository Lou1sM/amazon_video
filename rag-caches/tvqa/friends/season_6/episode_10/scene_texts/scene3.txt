UNK: No, but she did. Look, there's that old hippie I've always wanted.
UNK: If they are here, Gunther knows about it.
UNK: And I could get it out of him. He's had a huge crush on me.
UNK: That's not fair to play with his head, though. You do it.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Hey, Gunther.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Getting to be that holiday time again, huh?
UNK: Yes, it's like a miracle.
UNK: I was thinking, since it's the time of giving gifts...
UNK: I was wondering, are there any presents around here for me?
UNK: You know what I mean?
UNK: -I think I found them. -That's the Toys for Tots collection bin.
UNK: -That's awfully convenient, don't you think? -For the tots it is.
UNK: -Hey, you guys, guess what. -Did you find them?
UNK: No, Gunther fainted.
