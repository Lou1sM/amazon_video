UNK: -Wait a minute. We can't do this. -Why?
UNK: I don't want to know what Monica got me.
UNK: I'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me.
Chandler : And you guys are gonna ruin that.
Chandler : We have to put these back. This is not what Christmas is about.
Rachel : Whatever, Linus. I'm opening mine.
UNK: Nobody is opening anything, okay?
UNK: I want to see the look on her face when I give her my present.
UNK: I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine.
Chandler : So, please, please, can we just...? Can we put them back?
Phoebe : -Will you get us better gifts? -Fine.
Janine : Hey, guys.
Monica : You found the presents?
Monica : You let them find the presents?
UNK: Great.
Monica : Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
UNK: -That's what you got me? -Yes, I see. That look is priceless.
Joey : Home sweet home, huh?
Joey : Nice to get back to reality.
UNK: Plus, we know how the New Year's gonna go off.
UNK: I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, you know?
UNK: Anyway, good night.
UNK: -Joey? -Yeah?
UNK: Three...
All : two, one.
Janine : Happy New Year.
Joey : What was that for?
UNK: Tonight when they yelled "cut" and we didn't get to kiss...
Janine : I was really, really disappointed, and I just...
Janine : I just really wanted to kiss you.
UNK: Really?
Joey : In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Joey : -In the moment. -But only in the moment.
UNK: So do you want to kiss again?
UNK: Sure. New Year's Eve is only two weeks away.
Janine : Can you wait?
UNK: No.
Janine : Me neither.
All : Three, two...
UNK: You don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Phoebe : Oh. Okay.
UNK: Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready.
Monica : We were on the platform, ready to dance into the new millennium...
UNK: and the guy yells, "Cut!"
UNK: -So Joey didn't get to kiss Janine? -Nope, he sure didn't.
UNK: I guess that means that you guys are still tied.
UNK: I don't know about that. I think she saw us do our routine.
UNK: I may have boogied right into first place.
Rachel : So you guys are telling me that you actually did...
Rachel : the routine from eighth grade?
Monica : Yeah! But of course we had to update it a little bit.
UNK: Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.
UNK: There's no way you could've done the end...
Rachel : the way you guys did it back then.
Monica : What? We could do it.
UNK: I don't know. You were a lot bigger.. I mean, stronger back then.
Monica : I can do it, okay?
UNK: Come on, let's go! Come on.
UNK: One, two, three, four...
UNK: five, six, seven, eight.
UNK: I can't do it!
UNK: Now, you do that, you're on TV.
