UNK: You'd be better if you loosened your hips.
Joey : -What do you mean? -Like this.
UNK: That's it. Feel the rhythm. That's better.
UNK: You're dancing with her.
UNK: -We're together. -Yeah, we came together.
UNK: I don't see it.
Director : You are dancing with the tall guy. Tall guy, raise your hand!
UNK: Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her. I like her, and I think I have a shot.
UNK: Really, you think so? I don't.
Chandler : I couldn't find anything.. Hey, wait!
Rachel : Yeah, we found them.
UNK: They were in the guest-room closet.
Phoebe : You have nothing to worry about because they're crap.
UNK: Those are mine. I got those for you.
UNK: Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!
Rachel : Chandler, what is this very weird metal A-Z thing?
UNK: Those are bookends. That's a great gift.
Phoebe : Oh. Okay, I'm sorry. Thank you for my "az."
Chandler : Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet.
Rachel : Yes, okay.
UNK: By the way, I think it's really nice of you that even after you moved...
Rachel : you still keep storing that stuff for Joey.
UNK: Hey, dancing girl?
Joey : Can I go to the bathroom?
UNK: Here we go. Yeah.
Joey : Looking good, Gellers!
Ross : We know!
UNK: That snippy guy's the one who decides who gets on the platform.
Monica : -We should go dance by him. -Okay.
Director : Okay, everybody, hold!
Director : Next on the platforms are...
Director : You two! And...
Director : -You two! -Cool!
Monica : Excuse me, sir?
UNK: Would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
UNK: Monica!
Monica : Would it?
UNK: How about me?
Joey : Hey, tall guy!
UNK: I want to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with.
UNK: She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this.
Joey : Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
UNK: Look, I came with that girl, okay?
UNK: I plan to kiss her at the New Year's countdown.
UNK: I'm trying to win her over. I..
UNK: I don't think so.
Joey : You can dance with my partner.
UNK: She's real mellow.
UNK: Look, you dating this girl you came with?
Joey : I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could...
UNK: No. No. She's fair game if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.
UNK: All right. Hey.
UNK: Fair is fair. When you're right, you're right. What can I say?
UNK: Tall Guy : Are you in second grade?
UNK: Hey, man, you're the one who wet his pants.
UNK: Monica would not hide the presents down here.
