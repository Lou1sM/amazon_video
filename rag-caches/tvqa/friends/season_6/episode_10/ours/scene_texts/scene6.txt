Phoebe : Hey, look who I found.
UNK: Oh, hi, guys!
Phoebe : Birds have a very good sense of direction.
Phoebe : I thought maybe they could help us find the presents.
Chandler : Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Phoebe : Or we could just follow your clever jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.
UNK: Come on, show us where the presents are.
Chandler : The duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage.
Chandler : I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage.
UNK: How about my "az"?
Rachel : -Hey. This is hollow. -What?
UNK: This bench, it's hollow. I can't believe I never knew that!
Rachel : -Oh, the presents! -Don't look directly at them!
UNK: What?
UNK: All right, no, we could look at them.
UNK: This one's for me!
UNK: This one's for Chandler. Here.
UNK: -And the big one's for me! -Oh, let's open them!
