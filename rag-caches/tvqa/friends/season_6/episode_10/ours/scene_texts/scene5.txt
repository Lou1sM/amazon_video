UNK: It's almost fake midnight. Do we really have any other choice?
UNK: Okay, let's do it.
Monica : Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
UNK: Five, six, seven, eight!
UNK: So do we really need to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Director : You get up there and do that again, exactly like that.
UNK: Get this. Dick will want it for the Bloopers show.
UNK: All right, cut! Listen up, everyone!
Director : When we start again, it'll be the countdown...
UNK: so I want to see everybody's excitement!
Janine : Hey, guy!
UNK: You got three seconds to get away.
UNK: What's going on here?
UNK: Take a look at the guy's pants!
Joey : You told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went overboard?
UNK: What's the matter with you? Go!
UNK: Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!
Ross : Can you believe this?
Monica : We're on the platform for the millennial moment!
Joey : I know!
UNK: You haven't been practicing the routine, have you?
UNK: No.
Janine : Me too!
Ross : When the music starts...
UNK: I was thinking about maybe going into the robot.
UNK: Ross, we should stick to the routine. We don't want to look stupid.
UNK: All right, we're back! Ten seconds left.
UNK: -Ten. -Nine, eight.
UNK: -Seven. -Okay, it all comes down to this.
UNK: Destiny.
All : three, two, one!
UNK: -Cut! -No!
UNK: Year!
UNK: Happy "No" Year!
UNK: Now we go to the live shot of Times Square. That's a wrap!
UNK: What did that snippy guy say?
UNK: I think he's kicking out anyone who's not dancing.
UNK: So just keep dancing.
