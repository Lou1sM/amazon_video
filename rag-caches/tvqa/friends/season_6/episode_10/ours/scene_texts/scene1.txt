Director : Yeah. Now, you guys dance over there...
Director : you guys, over there. I want you two here.
Director : Everyone else, spread out.
UNK: We'd rather not dance together because we're brother and sister.
UNK: Yeah, it would seem kind of weird.
UNK: As weird as coming all the way down here and then having to go home right now?
Joey : So when is it gonna air?
Rachel : You look in the kitchen, I got the closet.
Chandler : I can save you time, ladies. I'm right here.
UNK: Yeah. Why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
UNK: We're looking for our presents from Monica.
UNK: That's terrible.
Phoebe : No, we do it every year.
Chandler : Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe : Yeah, we never find them.
UNK: She's always bested us, that wily...minx.
UNK: We'll search here for an hour...
UNK: and then we'll go to Joey's and search, okay?
UNK: -You can't look for Monica's presents. -We have to.
UNK: You don't have to. And you can't, because I live here too.
Phoebe : Well, then you should look with us.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Aren't you worried about what to get Monica?
Chandler : No, I have a great idea for her present.
UNK: Oh, that's it? A great idea? Oh, yeah?
Rachel : What if she gets you a great present...
UNK: two mediums and lots of little ones...
UNK: and you just get her one present? She'll feel bad.
Rachel : Why would you do that to her? Why? Why?
UNK: -If I help, we can find them faster! -Right!
Phoebe : We have a live one!
UNK: -Oh, it's a Macy's bag! -Yeah.
UNK: Who's it for?
UNK: "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?
Rachel : P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
Phoebe : Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Rachel : We are so gonna find them this year.
UNK: You said you'd go across the hall and look. Do you do that every year?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: You don't go into the back of my closet...
Chandler : and look under my gym bag or anything?
UNK: -No. Never do that. -No.
UNK: That's where Joey gave me stuff to store that I've never seen.
Chandler : Okay, that did not just happen.
UNK: Here comes a camera.
Ross : Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Ross : Why do they keep doing that?
Monica : We have to get up on one of those platforms.
UNK: They've been taping them all day.
UNK: Right.
UNK: What'd you guys do to get up on there?
Girl : We learned how to dance.
UNK: When you learned to dance, did you forget how to put on underpants?
UNK: Yeah!
UNK: -Hey, you're a good dancer. -Really?
