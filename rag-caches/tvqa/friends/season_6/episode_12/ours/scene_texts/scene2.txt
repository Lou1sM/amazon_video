Ross : Oh, hey, Gunther...
Ross : check this out.
UNK: Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.
Joey : You want anything to drink? I'm heading up there.
UNK: -I'll take a coffee. Thanks. -Sure.
UNK: -Coffee? -No.
UNK: Coffee? I'm going up there.
Monica : No, thank you.
UNK: You need anything? I'm heading up there.
UNK: I'd love ice water.
Joey : You got it.
Phoebe : What are you doing?
Joey : Just being friendly.
UNK: You're not supposed to go back there.
UNK: It's okay. Right?
UNK: Don't wink at me.
Gunther : And put on your apron.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I don't see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
Monica : -Joey, do you work here? -No.
UNK: -Waiter. -Yeah!
UNK: What's going on? Why didn't you tell us you work here?
UNK: It's kind of embarrassing. I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.
UNK: It's supposed to go the other direction.
UNK: So's your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
UNK: I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know?
UNK: I guess if I'm hanging out here, I might as well get paid for it.
Joey : I just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know?
UNK: It'll be great.
UNK: Come on, I did it and it was fine.
Ross : Why would it be weird?
Ross : Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?
UNK: It doesn't seem that weird.
UNK: I asked before. You still haven't gotten it.
UNK: See, now it's weird again.
UNK: You're gonna make a lot of money. Here's your first tip.
UNK: Don't eat yellow snow.
UNK: 2 : 15, coffeehouse.
Rachel : This is great. Finally, someone I can pass my wisdom to.
UNK: Let me tell you some things I learned working here.
UNK: First, the customer is always right.
Rachel : A smile goes a long way.
Rachel : And if anyone is ever rude to you, sneeze muffin.
Joey : Thanks, Rach.
UNK: Hey, look, you guys are just terrific, you know?
Joey : How about clearing out so I can get some new customers?
UNK: It's all about turnover.
Ross : Seriously, can I get my coffee?
UNK: I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.
UNK: And since you waited, I'll toss in a free muffin.
