Joey : I like your natural color.
UNK: It's a great part. I'm the lead guy's best friend.
UNK: I wait for him and save his seat. Listen.

UNK: -That's the whole part? -Maybe he's not his best friend.
UNK: I'll see you.
Joey : Oh, man.
Joey : I could totally get that part. "I'm sorry, this seat is taken."
