UNK: Hey! You're not gonna believe this.
UNK: Yes, Ross, we know they have magazines with pictures of naked women in them.
UNK: Don't tell him about the videos!
Ross : I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy.
Ross : They printed it.
UNK: I didn't know they print jokes.
Ross : They print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.
UNK: It's not just about the pictures.
UNK: Didn't work on Mom, it's not gonna work on us.
UNK: Check it out. It's the first one.
UNK: Right there.
Chandler : That is funny.
Chandler : It was also funny when I made it up.
UNK: -What? -I made that joke up.
UNK: No, you didn't. I did.
UNK: Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
UNK: Hey, tell Dan thanks.
UNK: What?
Rachel : I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Chandler : Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
UNK: -No. -Seriously?
Monica : You tell a lot of jokes.
UNK: Look, it's my joke.
UNK: But if it makes you feel better, they don't print the name.
UNK: So it doesn't really matter who gets credit.
Chandler : Yeah, I guess.
Joey : -Hey, guys. -Playboy printed my joke!
UNK: No, it's mine! Call them! They'll tell you!
Ross : -My joke! -My joke!
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
UNK: Jokes? What...?
UNK: You know there's naked chicks in there, right?
UNK: The One With The Joke
UNK: Monica's watching a show. I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
UNK: Hey, Chandler? You know what we should do?
Joey : You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
Chandler : What? No, I want to watch this.
Chandler : -Did your cable go out? -No. No, that's VH1.
UNK: I tell you, the music these kids listen to today...
UNK: it's a lot of noise to me.
Chandler : Why is your cable out?
UNK: Oh, because I haven't really paid the bill.
Chandler : If you need money, would you please let me loan you some?
UNK: No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?
UNK: I know things have been tight since Janine moved out. God, was she hot.
Joey : I know, yeah.
Joey : Look, I can handle it, all right? I can listen to the radio.
Joey : And Ross gave me this great book.
Chandler : Want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch at his place?
UNK: Sure.
Chandler : -Paid your phone bill? -No.
UNK: It's only you.
Phoebe : -What are you doing? -Looking at a Playboy.
Phoebe : I want to look too!
UNK: Yikes!
UNK: Do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story?
UNK: Sure. Like in the case of this young woman...
Rachel : she has lost her clothes.
Rachel : So she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, "Where are they?"
UNK: She's not gonna find them, lying in the grass like that.
UNK: Remember the days when you'd go out to the barn...
Phoebe : Lift up your shirt and bend over?
Rachel : You see, now, I would date this girl.
UNK: She's cute, she's outdoorsy.
Rachel : And she knows how to build a fire. That'll come in handy.
UNK: I got a question.
Monica : If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
