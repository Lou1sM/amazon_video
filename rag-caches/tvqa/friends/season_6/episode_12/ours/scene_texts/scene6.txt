Chandler : And what may be perceived as high maintenance...
Chandler : is merely attention to detail...
UNK: and...
Chandler : generosity of spirit.
Rachel : Wow. You know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
UNK: Really? I've heard better.
Monica : Wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them.
UNK: I'm out of words. Should I say it again?
Monica : Look, I am not high maintenance!
Monica : I am not. Chandler!
UNK: You're a little high maintenance.
Monica : You are on my list!
UNK: Look, I'm sorry, but you're not..
UNK: You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.
UNK: And that's good.
UNK: And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good...
UNK: at making you feel better.
UNK: That's good too. They say you're high maintenance...
UNK: but it's okay, because I like...
Chandler : maintaining you.
UNK: I didn't tell him that.
UNK: -You're off my list. -I'm off the list.
UNK: Phoebe?
UNK: It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.
Monica : I have the best boyfriend.
Rachel : You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
UNK: How'd the audition go?
UNK: Oh, not good. No.
UNK: I didn't get the part. And I lost my job here, so...
Phoebe : Wow, that is a bad audition.
UNK: Well, how did you lose your job here?
Joey : I had the audition...
Joey : but Gunther said I had to stay so he could get his hair dyed.
UNK: So I went anyway, and he fired me.
Rachel : He left work to do a personal errand...
Rachel : and left you in charge when you've been here two days?
UNK: That's not right.
UNK: What are you gonna do?
UNK: You can't let him get away with that.
UNK: I won't let him get away with that. I'm gonna say..
UNK: I shouldn't say anything. No, I should say something!
UNK: Gunther? I want you to give Joey his job back.
UNK: -It's not fair that you have to fire.. -Okay.
UNK: -What? -He can have his job back.
UNK: That's right, he can have his job back.
Rachel : Glad we got that all straightened out.
Rachel : There you go, Joey.
Rachel : -Got your job back. -That's great. Thanks.
Rachel : Pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
UNK: -Rach, you're in my seat. -I'm sorry.
UNK: I never heard who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.
UNK: -I'd pick you, Phoebe. -Yeah, definitely you, Phoebe.
UNK: Yeah, I kind of thought.
UNK: -Never. -It would totally be you.
Monica : If you had to pick one of the other two to go out with...
Rachel : who would you pick?
Ross : -No way. -I'm not answering.
UNK: Joey.
UNK: No way, I'm not answering that.
