Rachel : Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.
UNK: Okay.
Monica : So, maybe I am a little high maintenance.
Monica : And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.
UNK: But you know what you are?
UNK: We are sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
UNK: That's true, I am flaky.
UNK: So, what, you're just okay with being flaky?
Phoebe : Yeah, totally.
UNK: Then I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Rachel : Yeah. And I am okay with being a pushover.
UNK: That's great. Good for you guys.
Monica : -I am not high maintenance! -I am not a pushover!
Phoebe : -Who said you were? -You did!
UNK: I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Ross : Hey, Gunther.
Joey : Can you cover for me? I got an audition.
