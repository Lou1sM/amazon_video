Patron : -Excuse me. -No, I didn't mean you.
Joey : But you believed me?
Patron : I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
UNK: So you'd hire me, right?
Patron : For what?
UNK: Exactly! All right, everybody listen up!
UNK: The coffeehouse will be closed for about an hour.
UNK: What?
UNK: It's for the kids.
UNK: Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.
UNK: It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy.
UNK: I'm sure you all read about it.
UNK: Hey! Don't you wanna keep guns away from kids?
UNK: -You said, "drugs." -It's a vicious cycle. Get out!
UNK: Go!
UNK: -It's my joke. -It's my joke.
UNK: It's my joke.
UNK: I don't think we're gonna settle this.
UNK: Let's have Monica decide.
Ross : -Hey, Mon! -Get out here!
UNK: -Monica? -Okay.
UNK: You have to decide whose joke this is.
Monica : Why do I have to?
UNK: You're the only one that can be fair.
UNK: I can't be. You're my boyfriend.
UNK: But I'm your brother. We're family.
UNK: That's the most important thing in the world.
UNK: Don't try to sway her.
UNK: I'm your only chance to have a baby.
UNK: -Okay, let's go. -All right.
UNK: We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke...
Ross : then you decide which one of us is telling the truth. Me.
UNK: Chandler, you first.
Chandler : I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
UNK: -Did I meet him at Christmas? -Can I finish?
Monica : You want me to pick you?
Ross : See, I would never snap at you like that.
UNK: Two babies.
UNK: -Continue. -Okay.
Chandler : Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
UNK: I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
Ross : Are you kidding?
UNK: Okay, look, I study evolution.
Ross : Remember? Evolution.
Ross : Monkey into man.
UNK: Plus, I'm a doctor. And...
Ross : I had a monkey.
UNK: I'm Dr. Monkey!
UNK: I'm not arguing with that.
UNK: I've heard enough for my decision.
UNK: -Okay, so what..? -Do tell.
Monica : You are both idiots.
UNK: It's not funny. And it's offensive to women.
Monica : And doctors. And monkeys.
UNK: You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.
UNK: You should argue over who gets blamed for inflicting this joke on the world.
Monica : Now, let it go.
Monica : The joke sucks.
UNK: -It's your joke. -It is not.
UNK: -Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are. -Hi.
UNK: Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.
UNK: Why don't you tell them...
UNK: what you told me about me not being high maintenance.
Chandler : Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.
Chandler : Being with her has been like being on a vacation.
