UNK: -I don't know. -Me neither.
UNK: Rachel.
UNK: What?
UNK: I don't know.
Monica : Me neither.
UNK: You know, you forget how many great songs Heart had.
UNK: "Barracuda" was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Chandler : So you heard it, you repeated it...
Chandler : so that must mean you wrote it.
Joey : You guys with this joke. Well, I gotta say...
Joey : I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
UNK: What?
UNK: You didn't get it?
Ross : The doctor is a monkey.
Chandler : And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Chandler : You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Ross : Your joke?
UNK: Well, I think the Hef would disagree.
Ross : Which is why he sent me a check...
UNK: for $100.
Chandler : So you stole my joke and you stole my money?
UNK: I was gonna stick it in the ATM.
UNK: But now I think I'll show the sexy teller...
Ross : that I am a published writer.
UNK: She'll know that you stole the joke.
UNK: You gonna follow me there?
UNK: -Yeah. -I'm not gonna go now.
UNK: Okay.
Gunther : Here you go.
UNK: Gunther?
UNK: I can't pay now, because I'm not working.
UNK: I've had to cut down on some luxuries like...
UNK: paying for stuff, so...
Gunther : Well, if you want, you can work here.
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: It's just...
Joey : See, I was a regular on a soap opera, you know?
Joey : And to go from that to this, it's just...
UNK: And plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
UNK: Okay. But the money's good.
Gunther : Plus, you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
UNK: What?
Gunther : Flexible hours.
Joey : Maybe I could be a waiter.
Joey : Could I use the phone?
Monica : She picked Rachel.
Monica : She tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
UNK: He took my joke. He just took it.
UNK: This is wrong. You know what else is wrong?
Monica : Phoebe picking Rachel.
Chandler : Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.
Chandler : Know what else Ross did? He stole my joke.
UNK: I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know?
Chandler : And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
UNK: Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?
Monica : -Picking Rachel. -That's right.
Monica : Did you hear something?
UNK: Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain to steal my thoughts.
UNK: It's coming from the living room.
Joey : I finished my book.
Monica : -Hey, you guys. -Hey.
UNK: Don't you guys look cute.
UNK: You guys make a cute couple.
Phoebe : What are you doing?
Monica : Just trying to re-create some of the fun that we had at my place.
Monica : Remember? When you picked Rachel over me?
Monica : That was funny.
UNK: -It was kind of funny. -It wasn't funny at all!
Monica : Why would you do that?
UNK: Why didn't you pick me?
UNK: Fine.
UNK: The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you...
UNK: is just, you know, you're...
Phoebe : high maintenance. Let's go to lunch!
Monica : That is completely untrue.
UNK: You think I'm high maintenance? Prove it.
UNK: You write out a list, and we'll go through it point by point.
UNK: No, you're right, you're easygoing.
UNK: You're just not as easygoing as Rachel. She's just more...
UNK: flexible and mellow. That's all.
Rachel : Well, people are different.
UNK: Rachel will do whatever you want. You can just walk all over her.
UNK: What? Are you saying that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
UNK: Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.
UNK: You think I'm a pushover. Well, watch this.
UNK: You're not invited to lunch!
Rachel : What do you think? Pretty strong, I think.
UNK: Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
Monica : You start working on that list.
Rachel : -I cannot believe her. -I know. Where do you want to eat?
Rachel : -Oh, I love that Japanese place. -I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.
UNK: Wherever you want to go is cool.
