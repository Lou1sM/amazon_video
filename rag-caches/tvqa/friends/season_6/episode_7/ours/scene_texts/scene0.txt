UNK: Ready?
UNK: Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's. Please...
UNK: -Leave.. -Leave.
UNK: But I just said "leave."
Phoebe : I know because you have all the good words.
UNK: What do I get? I get "it's," "and." Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a." Forget it.
Rachel : -That's silly. -All right. So let's switch.
UNK: No, I have all the good words.
UNK: Okay, fine, fine. We can switch.
UNK: [scene : - Hi... -everybody...
UNK: -It's... -Rachel...
UNK: -and... -Phoebe's.
Phoebe : Wait. How did you do that?
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Oh, you're no ordinary roommate, are you?
UNK: This is gonna be interesting.
Rachel : Can we finish this later? I'm going running before it gets dark.
Rachel : -Why don't you come with me? -Really?
Rachel : It'll be fun! We'll run in the park. It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.
Phoebe : Okay, let's go running!
UNK: -There's cute guys there. -Let's run towards them!
Phoebe : Wait just one more second.
Phoebe : Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message. Thanks!
Rachel : Wait a minute. You took all the words!
UNK: You've met your match, Rachel Greene!
UNK: The One Where Phoebe Runs
Ross : So, theoretically, you could download...
Ross : your thoughts and memories into this computer...
Ross : and live forever as a machine.
Chandler : And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
UNK: Honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor.
Chandler : -I didn't nail the boxes to the floor. -So you can move them!
Chandler : And while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Joey : Hey, everybody! I'd like you to meet Janine.
Joey : She's gonna be my new roommate!
UNK: And she's gonna live with me!
Monica : It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
UNK: Le Croix.
Joey : I didn't know that. What a pretty last name.
UNK: So where are you from?
UNK: Australia. I just moved here.
Joey : From the land down under?
Joey : I didn't know that either!
UNK: So what do you do?
Janine : -I'm a dancer. -You're a dancer?
Joey : She's a dancer!
UNK: I think I'll go unpack.
UNK: Did you interview her before you asked her to move in?
Joey : Of course!
UNK: What did you ask her?
Joey : When can you move in?
Ross : Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
UNK: Unbelievable.
UNK: Down, boy.
UNK: Oh, no, no, no. She's not my type. Not for me, she's not my type. She's too..
UNK: Beautiful, tall, sexy, showing her stomach?
Chandler : Look at all the boxes!
Joey : I cannot wait to ask her out.
Rachel : Wait a minute. You can't. She's your roommate.
UNK: It'll be too complicated.
UNK: Yeah, don't do it.
Ross : I mean, if you date her, then I can't date her.
UNK: What if you started going out with her and it didn't work out?
UNK: That's when I make my move.
UNK: Remember when you broke up with Donna...
Chandler : how horrible it was when you bumped into her at the supermarket?
Joey : Oh, God, yeah.
Chandler : Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
UNK: Okay!
Joey : You're right! I don't want that. I can't date her.
