Ross : Wow. Couples who live together do start to look alike.
UNK: I am working right now. So say what you have to say and leave me alone!
UNK: Sound alike too.
Ross : So, Mondler...
UNK: What are you doing?
Chandler : What does it look like? I am cleaning.
Ross : Did you get Monica's authorization to move all her stuff?
Chandler : I don't need that. I'll put everything back.
Ross : Put it back exactly where you found it?
Chandler : Yes. I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Ross : First of all, that attitude is not helping.
UNK: She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Ross : Hello? Did you just meet Monica?
UNK: She'll recognize that I did a nice thing...
Chandler : and appreciate it.
Ross : Actually, this will work out well.
UNK: Because when you move back with Joey...
Ross : Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.
UNK: Oh, I see. You're trying to freak me out.
Ross : Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?
Ross : Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She's going to freak out.
Chandler : Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.
UNK: That probably won't hurt as much anymore.
UNK: No, she is not. I'll prove it to you.
UNK: I'll call her right now.
