Rachel : I handled the situation horribly.
Rachel : And I should not have lied to you.
Phoebe : So what should you have done?
UNK: I should have told you the truth.
Phoebe : Which is?
UNK: Well, the reason I didn't want to go running with you is...
UNK: because...
Rachel : the way that you run is just a little...
UNK: -So? -It's embarrassing.
Rachel : People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Phoebe : -Why do you care? -Because they're people!
UNK: People you don't know and will never see again.
Rachel : Yes, but still they are people...
Rachel : with eyes.
Phoebe : I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss...
UNK: But okay.
Phoebe : I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.
Phoebe : Okay. You're uptight.
UNK: What? I am not uptight.
Rachel : I am not uptight, man.
UNK: That's okay. I'm not judging you. That's just who you are.
UNK: I'm more free, you know. I run like I did when I was a kid...
UNK: because that's the only way it's fun, you know?
UNK: Didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off...
UNK: Like when you were running towards the swings or running away from Satan?
Phoebe : The neighbor's dog.
UNK: Is this in the right place?
Ross : Who cares? I repel women.
Chandler : You can't come in here!
Chandler : Ross is naked!
UNK: I couldn't say I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
Ross : Why does anyone have to be naked?
Monica : Why is Ross naked?
Ross : I had to show Chandler something.
UNK: Naked?
UNK: I guess I have...
UNK: a "guy" problem.
Monica : Is it the same thing Chandler had?
Chandler : We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later!
Monica : There's still some of Chandler's medicine in the bathroom.
UNK: -Bye. -Bye!
Chandler : Thank God.
Ross : Dude, what'd you have?
Chandler : We have no time, okay? We must focus.
UNK: We've got to get everything back into its original place.
Ross : The photo album!
Ross : There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
UNK: We just match everything to the pictures!
Chandler : That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Ross : What'd you have?
UNK: I've got some beer for you.
Joey : Don't you mean "for whom"?
UNK: Sure.
Janine : I was gonna order some pizza. You wanna share one?
UNK: Pizza? It's not like I never had that before.
UNK: Is something wrong?
UNK: Yeah. I'm depressed about that Irish potato famine.
UNK: No, I mean with me. Because you seem to be acting really weird around me.
Joey : All right, all right.
Joey : Let's just get this out in the open, okay?
Joey : You're hot.
Joey : I'm lovable.
Joey : Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us.
Joey : But we're roommates...
Joey : and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
UNK: Imagine living in a supermarket...
Joey : and you'll understand.
Joey : Okay? So the question is, what do we do?
UNK: There isn't anything to do.
Janine : I think you're really sweet.
UNK: But I'm not interested in you like that.
