Chandler : We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Russell : -Hello, is Ross there? -No, he's not. Can I take a message?
UNK: Yes, this is Russell, Ross' divorce lawyer.
UNK: Since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's giving the marriage a try.

Ross : Phasing it out.

Ross : About paleontology?
Ross : I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Ross : Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is important...
UNK: because I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
UNK: So if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression..
Rachel : Ross! Are you crazy?
Rachel : I am still your wife? Were you just never gonna tell me?
Rachel : What the hell is wrong with you?
Rachel : I could just kill you!
Ross : Well, hello, Rachel!
UNK: You've really done this before?
UNK: You just take a big, big swing, okay?
UNK: Now, don't hold back.
Rachel : What are you doing?
UNK: We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
