UNK: "...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is.."
Joey : Are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Ross : No. Why?
UNK: I never seen a guy stare so hard at something that didn't have chicks on it.
Ross : "There are three primary theories...
Ross : concerning sediment flow rate.

UNK: Why don't you open with a joke?
Chandler : Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club.
Chandler : Wait a minute, hold the phone.
UNK: You're not talking about Chuckles University?
UNK: Come on, we're kidding.
Rachel : You know what might make it less boring?
Ross : Thank you.
UNK: Some visual aids.
UNK: -You know what's a good visual aid? -Don't say naked chicks.
Joey : Why not?
UNK: I don't even know why I talk to you guys about it.
UNK: I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.
UNK: That's the way I did it till I was 19.
UNK: All right, 20.
UNK: Twenty-three.
Joey : Any good mail?
Chandler : Something from the Screen Actors Guild.
UNK: It's probably a residual check. Can you open it? I got...
Chandler : "Benefits lapsed."
UNK: That's weird.
UNK: I don't remember being in a movie called Benefits Lapsed.
UNK: It's not a check. Your health insurance expired because...
UNK: -you didn't work enough last year. -Let me see that.
UNK: Oh, I can't believe this!
Joey : This sucks!
Joey : When I had insurance, I could get hit by a bus...
UNK: or catch on fire, you know?
UNK: And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?
UNK: I'm sorry. There's never a good time to have to...
Chandler : stop catching on fire.
Joey : All right, well...
UNK: I guess I gotta go see my agent.
UNK: Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.
UNK: "Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street."
UNK: Hey, you're still alive!
UNK: How are you feeling?
UNK: It's so exhausting, waiting for death.
UNK: Oh, by the way, do you think you..
Rachel : What are you doing?
Phoebe : Preparing you for.. Didn't you think I was dead?
Phoebe : Did that not come off?
Rachel : Yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever.
UNK: -You wanna lie down? -Yeah, thanks.
Phoebe : Can you do me a favor?
Phoebe : Wake me up in a couple hours.
UNK: You know, if you can.
Rachel : Did you take these back?
Monica : I liked them so much that I bought some for myself.
UNK: They're really great, aren't they?
UNK: I love them.
Rachel : Nice try.
UNK: How'd the lecture go?
