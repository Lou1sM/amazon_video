UNK: Wait. Could I come back and haunt Monica and Rachel when they're in the shower?
UNK: -That's my girlfriend. -Hey, I'm dead!
UNK: -Give me them! -No, they are mine!
Monica : -You stole them from me! -You stole them from me!
UNK: Give me them!
Monica : Just wanna each take one?
Rachel : Yeah, that seems fair. We never use them.
Ross : Look, I really need some help, okay?
Ross : Why did I have to speak in a British accent?
Ross : What do I do?
UNK: Why don't you call Mummy and Daddy?
UNK: I'm serious! Someone's gonna find out and then they're never gonna offer me a job.
UNK: Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, phase the accent out.
UNK: People will think you're adjusting to life in America.
Rachel : Come on. No one will even notice.
UNK: They're probably not even listening to you.
UNK: They're not listening to me?
UNK: Of course they're listening to you.
Rachel : Everybody listens to you.
UNK: Monica, do you think I should try this phasing-out thing?
Monica : I think you look fine.
UNK: Whenever you're ready.
Joey : Hey, Timmy.
UNK: I've got a surprise...
Joey : for you.
UNK: Casting Director #1 : Hold it. I'm sorry.
UNK: Casting Director #1 : The surprise is a new swing set. If you could play it less intense.
Joey : Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.
UNK: Just hold on one second.
Joey : Hey, Timmy.
UNK: I've got a surprise for you!
UNK: Casting Director #1 : Oh, my God!
UNK: So that's why I feed my dog Purina One.
Joey : Pick up a bag today.
UNK: -That's where you pick up the bag. -Exactly.
UNK: The line is, "Pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.
Joey : Or I could just point to it.
Joey : Purina One. Point to a bag today.
UNK: I didn't get it, did I?
Estelle : Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: I'm here to audition for "Man."
UNK: You mean "Dying Man."
Monica : -Do it one more time. -Really? Really? Okay.
UNK: Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely from the Fake Accent University.
UNK: We'd like you to come onboard full-time!
Phoebe : Listen to this!
Phoebe : My reading was wrong. I'm not going to die.
Rachel : Really? How do you know?
Phoebe : My psychic is dead!
UNK: She must have read the cards wrong.
UNK: I'm sorry.
Phoebe : Better her than me.
UNK: Hey, let's bake cookies!
UNK: Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Chandler : Are you sure you can do this?
