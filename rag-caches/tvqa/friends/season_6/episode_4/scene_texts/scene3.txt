Chandler : Will you go to the hospital?
Joey : Hernia operations cost...
UNK: a lot probably, okay?
UNK: Besides, it's getting darker and more painful. That means it's healing.
UNK: Look, I'll loan you the money.
Chandler : Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...
Chandler : pushed back in.
Joey : Thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you back.
UNK: I don't want that hanging over my head.
UNK: Besides, when my insurance kicks in...
Joey : I can get all the free operations I want.
UNK: I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.
UNK: What's going on?
UNK: Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix.
UNK: I'm telling you, if I put my hand on my stomach...
UNK: it doesn't hurt that bad.
UNK: Hey, maybe you'll die!
UNK: Chandler, I'm scared.
Phoebe : No, we can go together.
UNK: Just don't wait too long, because I'm out of here sometime before Friday.
UNK: But I don't want to die.
UNK: It'll be fun. We'll come back and haunt these guys!
