UNK: Monica, which of all of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Monica : This bottle opener.
UNK: -And...? -And it's a magnet.
Rachel : Look at that!
Ross : How weird is that? You're moving in with me...
UNK: and you have the one thing I don't have.
UNK: It's like, in a way, you complete me.
UNK: -Kitchen. -What?
Ross : You complete me kitchen, matey!
UNK: I know what you're thinking.
UNK: That she'll move in with you, then fall in love with you, and then...
UNK: when she finds out you're already married, she'll be happy.
UNK: You know? You're just very sad.
UNK: Casting Director #1 : Oh, my God!
Ross : I see what this is. You are in love with Rachel!
UNK: It all adds up! You're obsessed with her. It's always :
UNK: "What will you do about Rachel? Why are you moving in with Rachel?
UNK: When will you confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
Ross : Saved by the bell.
UNK: Aren't these candlesticks mine?
Rachel : No, I bought those.
UNK: Oh, right. I forgot.
UNK: That you're a liar!
UNK: That's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again.

Ross : -They loved it. -Well, who wouldn't?
Phoebe : I know!
Ross : Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer.
UNK: It's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job.
Ross : How great would that look on the mailbox? Professor Geller.
Phoebe : Professor and Mrs.
Phoebe : And Mrs.?
Phoebe : You and Ross are still married.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Just kidding!
Rachel : Oh, God!
Phoebe : Saved your ass.
UNK: She told me I'm gonna die this week, so I'm bummed.
UNK: I know you don't know about readings, but that's the worst you can get.
UNK: That's crazy.
UNK: She'd say that to you?
UNK: You don't believe her, do you?
UNK: I don't know. She said that I'd have triplets...
Phoebe : but she also said one of them would be black.
Chandler : Just out of curiosity, did she say how you'd go?
UNK: She didn't tell me I'd die till the end of the session.
UNK: I wasn't gonna waste a whole other hour there!
UNK: I've only got a week left.
UNK: I've really gotta start living now!
Ross : Hey, everyone.
UNK: Well, today's my first lecture...
