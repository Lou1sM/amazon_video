UNK: -This is the temporary robot, right? -No. Why?
UNK: I thought it was gonna be a really cool robot.
Joey : Like the Terminator, or when I first saw you.
Wayne : I spent two years developing this. It's state of the art.
UNK: Sorry. It doesn't look like it can do anything.
Wayne : It can do this.
Elizabeth : This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
UNK: It's great to meet you, Paul.
UNK: I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me as Mr. Stevens.
Ross : Of course. Mr. Stevens.
Paul : So, Ross...
UNK: what's your problem?
Ross : Excuse me?
UNK: Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
UNK: It's funny...
UNK: It's not funny.
UNK: I don't like you going out with my daughter, Ross.
UNK: Okay, I can see that.
UNK: I think if you give me one chance, I can change your mind.
UNK: -Okay. -What?
UNK: Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind.
UNK: You've got one minute.
UNK: -Daddy. -Fine. Two minutes. Go.
UNK: A minute and 50 seconds.
UNK: I want you to know, I've never done anything like this before.
UNK: I mean, I've been in relationships in general.
UNK: But I've never done it with a student. I mean, not...
UNK: Not "it." We haven't done "it."
UNK: I mean, we've done stuff...
UNK: Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.
Ross : Two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
UNK: -I'm Irish. -And the Irish guy wins the joke.
UNK: Ross! How crazy that we would run into you.
UNK: Oh, my God! Thank you.
UNK: I'd like you to meet my friends. This is Phoebe, Monica and Chandler.
UNK: -Phoebe. -Hello.
UNK: -Monica. -Hi.
UNK: Chunder.
UNK: -Chandler. -Never going to remember that.
UNK: You're Elizabeth's dad? I see where she gets her...
Phoebe : rugged handsomeness.
UNK: Is there a Mrs. Stevens?
UNK: There's a Mr. Bing!
UNK: Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away after she was born.
Paul : I raised her by myself.
Paul : I get that a lot.
UNK: Why don't we all take a seat?
UNK: I'll get us all some coffees.
UNK: Yeah, why don't you...
Ross : Talk about whatever you want.
Ross : Whatever pops into your head.
UNK: It is strange seeing Ross here, this time of day...
UNK: because usually he's at the children's hospital.
UNK: But not looking for dates.
UNK: Monica is Ross's sister.
UNK: He's a great brother!
Paul : I had a sister.
Paul : She passed away.
UNK: You don't have to do that every time.
UNK: But Ross is a great guy. I was roommates with him in college.
Chandler : Funny story...
UNK: Your roommate in college died, didn't he?
Paul : A part of him did, yes.
Ross : Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
Ross : I hope you guys are finding something to talk about.
Chandler : -Yes. We were just.. -Sorry I'm late.
UNK: But I am ready to talk you up.
