UNK: -When does Liz's father get here? -I'm already here.
UNK: Ross is so great!
UNK: Hey, Phoebe. How's the book writing going?
UNK: Really well. I'm up to page 47.
UNK: -Wow! What are you writing? -Page numbers.
Chandler : Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.
UNK: You said you'd buy the kind with the baby.
Monica : -You said the baby creeps you out. -The little girl does.
Monica : -You said the baby. -Why would a baby creep me out?
Monica : Why would the little girl creep you out?
UNK: Can you please talk a little slower?
UNK: -This is for your book? -It's about relationships.
Phoebe : The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.
UNK: Keep going. This stuff's great.
Ross : Excuse me.
Phoebe : And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
Phoebe : And how people will believe anything as long as it's a compliment.
Rachel : -Oh, hi! -Hi.
Paul : -I left my keys here somewhere. -Well, let's look for them.
UNK: Hey, look! Are these them?
UNK: No.
Rachel : All right.
Paul : -Here they are. -Good.
Paul : -Thanks for your help. -Wait! Sorry!
Rachel : -Mr. Paul? -Just call me Paul.
UNK: Paul. I just wanted you to know that...
Rachel : Ross really is a great guy.
UNK: Maybe you could date him. It'd save me the trouble of killing him.
Paul : Are you okay?
UNK: You don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter.
Paul : Well, we were very young when we had her.
UNK: -We? -It usually takes two people to...
Rachel : Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!
UNK: What I meant was are you still "we" or are you just you?
UNK: I'm just me.
Paul : My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Rachel : So you raised her all on your own?
Paul : Yes, I did.
UNK: -What are you writing there? -I'm drawing a picture of you.
UNK: Well, that's very flattering.
UNK: But it'd be great if you could draw me with some clothes and a head.
Monica : How was your first day?
UNK: Pretty good. Except I got attitude from the robot.
UNK: Damn those robots. They're supposed to be our faithful servants!
UNK: It was the guy who controls the robot.
UNK: He hates me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich table...
Joey : right when I was reaching for one.
UNK: Why don't you get him fired?
Joey : I may have to. I hate to do it. But I'm the star, you know?
UNK: There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
Ross : Excuse me.
Rachel : Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: Joe! I'm glad I found you! I got an audition for you.
