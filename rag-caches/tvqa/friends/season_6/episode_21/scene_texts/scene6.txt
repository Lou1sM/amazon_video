Paul : So Ross was in college...
Paul : and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom.
Rachel : I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
UNK: -I'm going to the bathroom. -Take your time.
Ross : I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as..
UNK: Look. I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.

Rachel : We were. But that was just a...
Rachel : That was just a big drunken mistake.
UNK: You're back.
Paul : You two were married?

Monica : We said we would meet at the coffeehouse at 6 : 00.
UNK: We said 7 : 00.
UNK: We said 6 : 00!
UNK: The only way that I said 6 : 00...
