Paul : Hi, Ross.
Rachel : I was just getting him to like you.
UNK: Joey!
Rachel : Ross, Joey is not here.
UNK: I'll just wait for him in here!
UNK: Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
UNK: Yeah. It's okay. It's me...
Paul : Mr. Stevens.
UNK: I didn't... Oh, my gosh. I didn't even see you.
UNK: You did. You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.
UNK: You were shouting, "Joey!"
UNK: -Bye, Rachel. -Bye.
UNK: I'll call you later.
Ross : -See you. -Bye, Ross.
UNK: What? What the..? How did...? What?
UNK: You know, he lost his keys. So he was looking for them.
Ross : In your mouth?
UNK: No!
Rachel : Downstairs. And we got to talking...
UNK: for two hours. I liked him. I invited him for coffee.
Ross : You were at the coffeehouse!
UNK: What's the big deal? So I kissed the guy.
UNK: He is my girlfriend's father. It's weird!
Rachel : -You dated my sister! -That was different!
Rachel : -What? Why? -This is weird for me!
UNK: Ross, look. This is good for you.
UNK: Let's face it. So far the guy's not loving you.
Rachel : But I can turn that around. I've got the inside track.
UNK: We could all go out to dinner. And I could talk you up.
UNK: Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer.
Ross : -How is that important? -It's important!
UNK: There's a million guys who can play Mac...
UNK: and there's one robot.
Joey : And this one guy who controls it. I didn't know he could get me fired.
UNK: -What am I gonna do? -You're a pretty charming guy.
UNK: Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.
UNK: No, you've got to win over the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.
UNK: Go back there and kiss some serious robot ass!
UNK: That's not a bad idea!
UNK: If I have to be charming tomorrow, I'm not wasting it on you guys.
UNK: I got some saved for you, Phoebe.
UNK: Do you think Joey is more charming than me?
UNK: Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Chandler : You wish.
Phoebe : "You wish."
Monica : Stop writing about us.
UNK: I'm not writing about you. I'm writing about other people.
UNK: -Who? -Marsha and Chester.
Monica : Fine. Then you know what? I will just write about Phyllis.
UNK: -"Phyllis is sitting in the chair." -I see what you're doing.
UNK: "Phyllis sees what I'm doing."
Phoebe : I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
UNK: Morning!
UNK: How's my favorite genius and his robot?
UNK: -Don't touch him! -Okay.
UNK: Level with me. I keep hearing rumors that I might get fired.
UNK: They even have actors reading for my part.
UNK: Come on. You gotta give me a second chance.
Joey : I love this little guy.
