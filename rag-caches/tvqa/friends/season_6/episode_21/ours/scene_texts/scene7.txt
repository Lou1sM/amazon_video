UNK: would be if I said the sentence, "Let's meet at 7 : 00, not at 6 : 00."
UNK: If I had said 7 : 00, I would have said :
UNK: "My boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7 : 00!"
UNK: -Hi! -Oh, my good God!
Phoebe : -I know what time you said. -What?
UNK: Well, I know what time Chester and Marsha said.
Phoebe : What time?
Phoebe : Interesting turn of events.
UNK: Suddenly it's my book to the rescue. Let's see.
Phoebe : Very interesting.
Phoebe : Well this certainly clears things up.
Chandler : What does it say?
Phoebe : I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Chandler : Thank you for writing your book. It's a great book...
Chandler : and you are the queen of everything.
Phoebe : Thanks. So are you.
Chandler : I told you I should not wear this color.
UNK: "Monica.. Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday.
UNK: "Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6 : 00. Chester thinks it's 7 : 00."
Chandler : -You knew we were gonna miss the movie? -Right.
UNK: Instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book?
UNK: "Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."
UNK: I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.
UNK: I'm so sorry, man. Is there anything I can do?
Joey : Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Wayne : Joey, I want to talk to you.
UNK: I don't want to talk to you.
Joey : I hate you. You ruined my life.
Joey : -Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. -Hi.
UNK: I'll get you your job back if you help me out.
UNK: Why should I help you out?
Chandler : -The reason he just said. -What do you need?
Wayne : I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman.
UNK: You know, Sarah. I wish I could talk to her.
Joey : -Are you in love with her? -Yeah.
Wayne : Her. All of them. Anyone.
UNK: Yeah. I've been there, my friend.
UNK: Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...
UNK: if you can teach me to talk to women like you do.
UNK: You can't teach it. It's something you're born with.
Joey : You can teach it. I can show you right now.
UNK: -Really? -Sure. Yeah. I taught him.
UNK: Yeah. You should see the woman I'm with, way out of my league.
UNK: In fact, if you want, I can get you her.
UNK: Well, if you think about it...
Rachel : Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Paul : How to make the next one even shorter?
UNK: Wait a minute. That's not fair.
Rachel : He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily.
UNK: He just didn't tell me.
Rachel : Maybe I have to pee again.
Paul : Well, this is fun.
Paul : So, Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
UNK: I have had enough of this! I care a great deal about your daughter.
UNK: And I have treated her with respect!
UNK: So if you've got a problem with me..
Paul : -Are you yelling at me? -God, no.
Monica : You know what? If you don't like Ross, that's fine.
UNK: It doesn't matter. I'm going out with him anyway.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Well, if it doesn't matter to her...
UNK: it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling.
Paul : What can I say?
UNK: I still don't like you.
UNK: I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Paul : -Then we agree? -I guess so.
Paul : -Neither of us like Ross. -I like Ross.
UNK: Kids!
UNK: I just thought of a story about how nice Ross is.
UNK: That's okay. We're not liking Ross right now.
UNK: Well, I got a lot of those too.
Joey : You were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.
UNK: -The shipment never made it to Omaha? -You got it.
UNK: And the rabbi's beard? 100 percent horsehair.
Joey : Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.
UNK: It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey : Wayne! Wayne!
