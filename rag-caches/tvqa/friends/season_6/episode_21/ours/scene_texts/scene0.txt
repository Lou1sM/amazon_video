Rachel : -Okay, Chandler. -Okay.
UNK: And your horoscope says :
UNK: "On the 5th, a special someone will give you a gift."
Chandler : Well, thank you in advance.
UNK: "But the 12th brings a lover's spat."
UNK: You're going to make fun of my present.
Monica : Why would you do that?
UNK: Wait. "On the 19th, a secret crush announces itself."
Joey : -Hey, guys. -Hey.
UNK: It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
UNK: That's right. It's your first day.
UNK: Are you psyched to fight crime with your robot sidekick?
Joey : Am I? The lead in my own TV series?
UNK: I've dreamed about this for years!
Joey : Why have I not been preparing?
UNK: You're gonna be great.
UNK: But I gotta act with a robot. I know nothing about technology.
UNK: I can't even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn.
UNK: And that's only because it's there when you turn it on.
UNK: Our spat will start early this month.
UNK: I'll be waiting.
UNK: The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad
Rachel : Because the last one was such a big seller?
Phoebe : If you must know, I have written 14 books.
UNK: And as I'm the only one who has read them...
Phoebe : I can tell you that they have been well received.
UNK: But I lost all of them in the fire.
UNK: So this one I'm gonna keep in an asbestos-lined box far away from Rachel.
UNK: Who I forgive.
UNK: What are you doing later?
UNK: Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.
Rachel : -We do? -I wanna see what he wants.
UNK: Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Chandler : Wait a minute. Hold the phone.
UNK: You're not Elizabeth's dad?
UNK: That's the only one you get.
UNK: And he hates me.
UNK: He asked Elizabeth why she'd want to go out with a guy...
UNK: who couldn't get a girl his own age.
UNK: And what did she say to that?
UNK: And that's yours.
UNK: Come on. I really want this guy to like me.
UNK: It would really help if you guys could make me look good.
UNK: -Of course we'll help. -Thanks.
Monica : We know how tough those parent-teacher conferences can be.
UNK: -So here's your office set. -Wow!
UNK: Mac Machiavelli, private investigator.
UNK: Look at all the books I've read.
UNK: Let's get you to wardrobe.
UNK: When do I meet the robot?
UNK: Right now. He's right here.
UNK: The Producer : Joey Tribbiani, this is..
UNK: Wow! He's so lifelike.
UNK: Unbelievable.
UNK: The Producer : This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
UNK: How do you do there, buddy?
UNK: I'll let you two guys get acquainted.
Joey : Sorry about that.
UNK: -So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.? -C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
UNK: C.h.e.e.s.e. : Nice to meet you, Mac.
