Ross : And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
UNK: Ross, you and I are gonna have to have a little talk.
UNK: -Daddy, I.. -You're next!
UNK: Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Paul : Let me just see if I got this straight.
Paul : I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired.
UNK: What you heard was : "Take my daughter...
Paul : come up to my country house and ruin my weekend with Rachel."
Ross : -Please, Paul. Just let me explain. -No! Let me explain! Fired!
UNK: Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.
Ross : But I want you to know...
Ross : that you and I are not all that different. I mean...
UNK: I, too, am a "neat guy."
UNK: What?
Ross : And I, too...
UNK: am "just a love machine."
UNK: -Let me show you the guest room. -Okay.
UNK: I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out.
UNK: I'm not freaking out.
UNK: Why would I? A woman named Hildy called and said we were getting married.
UNK: But that happens every day.
Monica : Honey, we were at this beautiful place...
UNK: and I just put our names down for fun.
UNK: -I mean, what's the harm in that? -Right here.
UNK: Please don't think I was trying to pressure you.
UNK: -Phoebe and Rachel thought.. -Phoebe and Rachel?
Chandler : So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you...
UNK: Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy, and some band called the Starlight Magic Seven...
Chandler : who are available, by the way.
Monica : It was a mistake.
UNK: Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything, because you know I'm not ready.
Joey : I know.
Joey : I know.
UNK: Okay.
Ross : All right.
UNK: I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back.
UNK: We were really worried about you.
UNK: And that guy that never delivered his burrito?
UNK: He thought there was some sort of connection.
Phoebe : Did she buy it?
UNK: Totally.
UNK: -So did Hildy show you the place? -Yeah. It's beautiful.
UNK: I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.
Joey : I know.
Joey : -Hey, Gunther. -Take these cappuccinos to table 11.
UNK: And that guy wants some biscotti.
UNK: I just actually came in for a cup of coffee.
Gunther : Do you still work here?
Joey : No. I quit a long time ago.
UNK: Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.
Gunther : -Cool. I was gonna fire you anyway. -Great!
