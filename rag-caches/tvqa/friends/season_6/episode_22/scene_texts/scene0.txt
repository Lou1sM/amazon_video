Phoebe : Hi, you guys.
UNK: What's the matter?
UNK: Well, it's just.. It's one of these situations that I just hate.
Phoebe : A massage client gave me three tickets...
UNK: to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum.
UNK: Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
UNK: No. No. It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us.
UNK: -I'll give up my ticket. -Me too.
UNK: Okay. That's so generous.
Chandler : And I think Ross is generous too.
UNK: Great! Then it's just us girls.
UNK: -Great. -Yeah.
UNK: So what is the exhibit?
UNK: It's mostly just photographs...
Phoebe : of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Joey : Oh, man!
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
Joey : Hey, Ross, listen.
Joey : Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
Ross : Thanks, but I have plans. Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
UNK: -That's great! -Yeah.
Monica : Think about all the money that you're gonna make.
Ross : Why? What?
Monica : Well, her father pays you for babysitting, right?
UNK: That's funny. But maybe it's time to move on.
UNK: You know, let it go. Stop it!
UNK: Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father...
UNK: so he's much older than she is.
UNK: Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils.
Rachel : All that does is remind us that you're interested in fossils.
Ross : Okay, okay.
UNK: Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
UNK: -Ross? -Come on! That's funny.
UNK: Because he's gonna.. He's got, like, a hearing aid.
UNK: Because he's all old.
UNK: One second.
Paul : Okay, look, Ross.
Paul : Just so you know, since Lizzie likes you so much...
UNK: I've accepted the fact that you're dating her.
UNK: Really? That's great.
Paul : Yeah, but then I changed my mind.
UNK: I'm funny like that.
UNK: So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you.
UNK: I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
UNK: Look, I realize it upsets you.
Paul : Yes, it does.
UNK: But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
UNK: so I don't think there's anything you can do about it.
UNK: I'll tell the university about your relationship and have you fired.
UNK: Oh, a man with a plan!
UNK: The One Where Paul's The Man
Joey : Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something.
UNK: I get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down.
UNK: Now he's just laughing at me.
Joey : Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard!
UNK: Okay. Maybe when they put your picture back up...
UNK: they could put you by Matt Lauer.
UNK: Look at him just smiling at me.
Phoebe : Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.
UNK: -So I'm back. -Who are you?
Joey : Joey Tribbiani.
Joey : From the wall?
Joey : Okay, maybe this will jog your memory.
UNK: Okay, anyway.
UNK: I'm ready to go back up on the wall. I'm the star of a new TV show.
UNK: -Show me in the TV book. -It's not on TV yet.
UNK: Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Joey : Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.
UNK: So, now, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes?
Phoebe : Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
UNK: God.
