Monica : I love museums.
UNK: -Soaking up all the culture. -Yeah.
Monica : -Where do you want to start? -The gift shop!
Phoebe : -And then lunch. -Yes, but I can't eat too much.
UNK: Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight. He said he has a big surprise planned.
Phoebe : Do you think maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?
Rachel : What? No, why?
Phoebe : No reason. That would just be a really big surprise, right?
UNK: You could put the aisle over here and have the wedding ceremony over here.
UNK: I didn't know you could get married here.
Monica : This would be a beautiful place to get married.
UNK: But I wouldn't put the aisle there. And I would never have the ceremony there.
UNK: You'd have the ceremony under a beautiful arch.
UNK: The Museum Official : May I help you?
UNK: Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space.
Rachel : -Do you do a lot of weddings? -Yes, we're popular.
UNK: There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.
UNK: Monica, you should put your name down for this place.
Monica : What? Are you crazy?
UNK: I'm not getting married. I'm not even engaged.
UNK: But there's a two-year wait. What if you get engaged in two years?
UNK: Then you've got to wait another two years?
UNK: That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
UNK: He's gonna find somebody else.
Phoebe : Someone who did put their name on the list.
UNK: It can't hurt to put your name down.
UNK: If, in two years, you're not engaged, you just don't use it.
Monica : I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
UNK: I'm gonna do it too.
Joey : Me too!
UNK: -Really? Who would you marry? -I don't have anyone right now.
UNK: Oh, Phoebe.
UNK: Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
UNK: Phoebe, that's not..
UNK: Don't even get me started on yours.
Joey : -Did you watch the tape of my show? -I did.
UNK: -Let's get me back up there. -You don't go up on the wall.
UNK: -What? But you saw the show. -It was very offensive to my people.
UNK: [scene : Dry cleaners?
UNK: The Dry Cleaner : Russians. It showed them as terrorists and villains.
Ross : Okay, okay. Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!
UNK: That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
UNK: The Dry Cleaner : He brings us a lot of clothes. You bring nothing!
UNK: Okay, that may be true.
UNK: But in Air Force One, okay, the Russians were terrorists and evil!
Joey : And plus, he kills a bunch of them. That's offensive to Russians.
UNK: -I've never seen it. -You should. It's great!
Ross : This place is really beautiful.
UNK: I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my grandma's.
Ross : The only thing I got from my grandmother was her eyes.
UNK: I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
UNK: But people say that my eyes look...
UNK: Do you wanna make out?
UNK: Sure.
Elizabeth : Are you okay?
UNK: What's wrong?
UNK: Yeah. I was just thinking about your father.
UNK: Well, whatever works for you.
UNK: No.
Ross : He just really freaked me out before.
Elizabeth : So we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
Elizabeth : Big deal.
UNK: Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: -Yeah? -You brought protection, right?
Ross : Why, are there, like, bears or something?
UNK: Protection. Yeah. No, yeah. That.. That I forgot.
UNK: I can't believe I brought two cans of bug spray and forgot that.
UNK: -I'll run to the store and get some. -I'm the guy. I'll get it.
Elizabeth : -Do you know where the store is? -No.
UNK: Do you wanna ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
Ross : A little bit.
UNK: I'll be back in 10 minutes. Get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
UNK: Okay.
