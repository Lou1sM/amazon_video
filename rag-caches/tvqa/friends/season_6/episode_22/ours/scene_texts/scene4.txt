UNK: I know. That's why I like it here.
UNK: I feel like we're the only two people in the world.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: What's the matter, honey?
Paul : -Did you see a little mouse? -No! Big bear! Big bear outside!
Rachel : I think I..
Rachel : -Actually, would you go check on that? -We don't have any bears here.
Rachel : Well, okay.
Rachel : Would you get me a Diet Coke?
UNK: -Okay. Be right back. -Okay.
Rachel : -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here?
Rachel : -I came with Paul! -Yeah. I recognized the ankles.
UNK: -Where is Elizabeth? -She's at the store.
UNK: -You make the girl go to the store? -Do I know where the store is?
UNK: Hurry up. Get out.
Paul : Here you go, honey.
Paul : -Thank you! -Diet Coke.
UNK: Ice.
Rachel : I need ice.
UNK: Okay.
Paul : -Thank you. -Be right back.
UNK: Okay.
Ross : You and your ice.
Rachel : Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!
UNK: No, not in there! Not in there! He's in there!
Ross : -Did you really hear a bear? -Go!
Paul : Here you go, honey.

Paul : Thank you.
UNK: I am so happy that you're here.
Elizabeth : -Here I am! -Elizabeth!
UNK: Look! Elizabeth's here!
Paul : Who were you talking to?
Phoebe : You guys?
Paul : How did you know we were here?
UNK: She obviously saw the tire tracks leading up to the closed garage.
UNK: Obviously.
Rachel : What are you doing here?
Rachel : Did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Well, why don't you go in that room and do your homework?
UNK: I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
UNK: That's your dad's bedroom.
UNK: That's your dad's bedroom!
Paul : Why are you yelling?
UNK: That Diet Coke, I think, just straight to my head!
Monica : Hi, honey.
Chandler : See you later.
UNK: Wait. I bought groceries. I was gonna make you dinner.
Chandler : Well, next time, ask!
Chandler : Or at least wait for me to ask!
