UNK: I'm an actor. I'm trying to get my picture on the wall.
UNK: You know, there are two people who could get your picture up there.
Joey : Oh, really?
Joey : Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.
UNK: You're the other one, right?
UNK: So, Lizzie, are you planning on staying the night?
UNK: No, no. Believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible.
UNK: Good. Not that we don't want you to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.
Paul : How much more homework do you have?
Elizabeth : I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve.
UNK: Rachel, maybe you wanna come upstairs and help me figure it out?
UNK: Really?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay, I'll go upstairs...
Rachel : if you get me something from the car.
Paul : What do you need from the car?
Rachel : Surprise me.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: So you're gonna be in the car! I will be upstairs!
UNK: That's where everybody's gonna be!
UNK: Just relax. Relax, Paul. You're doing great.
Paul : She likes you.
UNK: I think she likes you. She likes you.
UNK: You know why? Because you're a neat guy.
Paul : You are the man.
Paul : You are the man!
Paul : Still got it.
UNK: Still sexy.
UNK: You're just a love machine.
UNK: Showtime.
UNK: -Phoebe? -Yeah?
Monica : -Have you seen Chandler? -No, why?
Monica : The museum called and said that there was a cancellation...
Monica : and that we could move up our wedding. And Chandler heard.
Monica : I know. How bad is this?
UNK: Well, with a regular guy, it's bad. With Chandler, oh, dear God!
Monica : I know! And he totally freaked out. I can't find him anywhere!
Phoebe : -What are you gonna do? -I'm never going to listen to you again.
UNK: "What harm can it do if you put your name down?"
Phoebe : -Rachel said that. -Well, Rachel's not here!
UNK: You really think she put your picture up already?
UNK: Did she put my picture up?
UNK: You kidding, after the date we had?
UNK: I wouldn't be surprised if she put 10 of my pictures up there.
UNK: Except for the fact that I only gave her one. I don't know where she'd get the other nine.
Phoebe : Here it is!
Phoebe : Joey, why did you sign it "son of a bitch"?
UNK: -I didn't do that. Who would do that? -Son of a bitch!
Phoebe : Okay. Maybe ask this guy.
UNK: The Dry Cleaner : -You! Get out of my shop! -What did he do?
UNK: The Dry Cleaner : -He went out with my wife! -Joey!
UNK: I did not go out with your wife! Okay?
Joey : I went out with her.
UNK: That's my wife!
UNK: I'm not pointing at her, no. I'm pointing at her.
UNK: "Zelda McMurray."
UNK: Who the hell..? How did she get up there?!
Rachel : Get out!
Phoebe : -Well, we should go. -Yeah.
UNK: Ross?
UNK: Elizabeth!
