Rachel : Did everything go okay with the annulment?
Ross : No problems. It's all taken care of.
Rachel : Ross, thank you.
UNK: Want to go see a movie?
Ross : Yeah, why not?
UNK: I'll get my sweater.
UNK: Want to hear something weird?
UNK: Always.
UNK: I didn't get the annulment.
UNK: What?
UNK: We're still married.
UNK: Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Ross : Do you have any gum?
UNK: Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just talk to you for just a second?
UNK: We'll be late for the movie.
UNK: There's a cab. Taxi!
UNK: That's great.
UNK: What timing! My God, huh? There you go.
UNK: We're gonna walk. It's right at the Angelika.
UNK: The Angelika! Go! Go!
UNK: You didn't get the annulment?!
Ross : I know.
Ross : I tried, but when I got to my lawyer's office, all I heard was :
Ross : "Three divorces! Three divorces!"
UNK: Yes, in that high voice.
UNK: I just don't want my tombstone to read : "Ross Geller : Three Divorces."
UNK: Don't worry about that. Your tombstone can say whatever you want.
UNK: It can say, "Ross Geller : Good at Marriage."
UNK: You know? Mine's gonna say, "Phoebe Buffay : Buried Alive."
UNK: All I know is, I can't have another failed marriage.
UNK: So you're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?
Phoebe : Woman. Sorry.
UNK: Okay, so I don't have it all worked out quite yet.
UNK: Just don't say anything to Rachel.
Phoebe : Rachel is one of my closest friends.
UNK: But being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special. Okay.
UNK: Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?
Phoebe : Hey, Rach!
Rachel : What was that?
UNK: Sorry. Mix-up.
Phoebe : How was the movie?
UNK: I haven't seen it yet.
UNK: You'd better hurry. The Angelika! Go!
UNK: The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel
Chandler : No, when it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
UNK: Did you tell him you're moving out?
Chandler : No, I keep trying. And I can get out, "Joey, I have to.."
UNK: Then I lose my nerve and I finish with, "go to the bathroom."
UNK: He may think I'm sick.
UNK: I have to tell Rachel, but... We just gotta get it over with.
Monica : Next time we see them, we'll just tell them. That's it.
UNK: That's how it'll work now? You'll just order me around?
Monica : -Pretty much. -All right.
UNK: Hey, man, you feeling better?
Monica : We have something to tell you.
Joey : Oh, my God!
UNK: You're pregnant!
UNK: No!
UNK: Look, Joe, here's the thing.
