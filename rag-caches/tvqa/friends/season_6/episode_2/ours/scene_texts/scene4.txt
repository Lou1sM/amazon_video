UNK: Soon.
UNK: I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got.
UNK: I couldn't do it. She's my best friend.
UNK: Joey's my best friend.
UNK: I'm not your best friend?
Chandler : You just said..
UNK: Of course you're my best friend.
UNK: Would you tell Rachel?
UNK: All right. At least I'm prepared.
Chandler : Oh, yes.
UNK: -They're not for you. Are you upset? -I am now.
Rachel : Hey, roomie.
Chandler : Okay, bye.
UNK: There's something important I have to tell you.
Rachel : Are you pregnant?
UNK: No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
Monica : I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
UNK: When I said that Chandler and I wanted to live together...
Monica : we meant alone together.
UNK: Oh, my God. That's funny. I can't believe I did that.
UNK: No, sweetie. You know what? This is my fault.
UNK: I wasn't clear.
UNK: I'm really sorry.
Monica : Listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay?
UNK: There's absolutely no rush.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Don't you want a cookie?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Thanks.
Monica : Do you need a tissue?
Rachel : -Where did you get these? -I made them.
UNK: Oh, God, they're so yummy!
UNK: -Okay, whose is this? -That's mine.
UNK: -And what about this? Whose is this? -That's mine.
UNK: Okay, whose dishwashing soap is this?
UNK: That was here when we moved in.
UNK: Oh, I guess it really is concentrated.
UNK: It's gonna be weird when I come home and you're not here.
UNK: No more Joey and Chan's.
UNK: No more J and C's.
UNK: Want to go to Joey and Chandler's? Can't. It's not there.
UNK: I'll be across the hall. We can still do all the same stuff.
UNK: We won't be able to have those long talks at night...
Joey : about our feelings and the future.
Chandler : Not once did we do that.
UNK: Don't you remember that night, it was late and I was feeling sick...
UNK: and you said I would feel better tomorrow?
UNK: Oh, yeah. I remember that.
UNK: I don't know. I'm just gonna miss living with you.
UNK: Yeah, me too, man.
Rachel : -What the hell is that? -That's disgusting.
UNK: I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.
UNK: Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Monica : Really well.
Monica : Surprisingly well.
UNK: She didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
UNK: And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
UNK: All I'm asking for is a little emotion.
Monica : Is that too much to ask after six years?
UNK: What, are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?
UNK: I mean, did we not have as much fun? Don't I deserve a few tears?
UNK: When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.
Joey : I did not cry my eyes out!
UNK: Come on, it's like the end of an era.
UNK: No more J-Man and Channy's!
Chandler : Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
Russell : You got married again?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: So that's your second marriage in two years?
