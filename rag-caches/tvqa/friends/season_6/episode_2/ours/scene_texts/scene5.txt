Ross : Yes. Second in two years.
Ross : Third, overall.
Russell : I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years...
UNK: and never have I had so much business from one client.
UNK: Why don't you tell me what happened?
Ross : Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk.
UNK: I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel whose name you said...
Ross : at the altar in the second marriage?
UNK: Yes, yes, yes.
UNK: But I do not love her.
UNK: That's better then.
Ross : This was just a drunken mistake, and I need to get it annulled.
Russell : I see.
Russell : Have you considered therapy?
Ross : I think just the annulment for today.
UNK: -There are some forms to fill out. -Easy.
UNK: We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.
Ross : No problem.
UNK: We'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
UNK: There's no way to do this without her?
UNK: Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of.
Russell : Of course you did.
UNK: Look, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Ross : What about someone who looks like Rachel?
Ross : I will think about the therapy.
Monica : So I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
