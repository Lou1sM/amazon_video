UNK: Okay.
Monica : No point in dragging it out.
Monica : Dragging out the long process of you moving out...
Monica : and us not living together anymore.
UNK: What about this? Who gets this?
UNK: I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories.
UNK: -What is that? -I don't know.
UNK: How about this? I want you to have the big plate.
UNK: Wow, Monica, thanks. I love this plate.
Monica : Something to remember me by.
UNK: Mon, you're not dying. I'm just moving out.
UNK: We're gonna see each other all the time.
UNK: But still, it's a big change.
Monica : The end of an era, you might say.
UNK: Are you okay? You're not blinking.
UNK: I'm fine. I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
Rachel : Oh, all right.
UNK: But I gotta say, I don't think six years counts as an era.
Monica : An era is defined as a significant period of time.
UNK: It was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
Rachel : -What is the matter with you? -What is the matter with you?!
UNK: Why aren't you more upset?
UNK: Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together?
UNK: Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
UNK: Monica, all right. But don't get mad at me.
UNK: It's just a little hard to believe.
UNK: What's hard to believe?
UNK: I mean, it's you guys. You do this kind of stuff, you know?
Rachel : You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out.
UNK: I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it. I'm sorry.
UNK: It's going to happen.
UNK: Chandler will move in here.
Monica : -But I.. -I know, just let me finish, okay?
UNK: This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
Monica : This is something that we both really want.
Monica : And it is going to happen.
Monica : It is?
UNK: Really?
Monica : Yeah, sweetie.
UNK: You mean, we're not gonna live together anymore?
Joey : Oh, my God. I'm gonna miss you so much.
UNK: I'm gonna miss you.
UNK: I mean, it's the end of an era!
Ross : I know!
Chandler : -Okay, bye. -Oh, no.
Phoebe : So did you get the annulment?
UNK: -I couldn't. -I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
UNK: It's not that. Annulments are more complicated..
UNK: Complicated because of the love.
Ross : I do not love Rachel.
UNK: I'm telling her about the whole thing...
Ross : so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
Ross : Would I do that if I loved her?
UNK: I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Ross : I do not have feelings for Rachel, okay?
UNK: Oh, what's wrong?
Rachel : Monica and Chandler are moving in here...
Rachel : and I have to move out and everything is changing.
UNK: Oh, my God, come here, come here. It's okay.
UNK: Everything's gonna be okay.
Rachel : -Thank you. -Of course.
Joey : So Ross and Rachel got married.
Rachel : Monica and Chandler almost got married.
UNK: You think we should hook up?
Phoebe : Oh, we do.
Phoebe : But not just yet.
Joey : Really? Well, when?
Phoebe : Well, first Chandler and Monica will get married...
Phoebe : and be filthy rich, by the way.
UNK: But it won't work out.
Ross : I know.
UNK: Then I'll marry Chandler for the money.
UNK: And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
UNK: Great.
UNK: But then we ditch them and we get married.
UNK: We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids.
Phoebe : Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Joey : What about Ross?
UNK: I don't want to go into the whole thing.
UNK: But we have words and I kill him.
