Chandler : Monica and I have decided to live together, here.
UNK: I'm gonna be moving out, man.
UNK: I'm really happy for you guys. Congratulations. See you later.
Monica : Are you okay?
UNK: I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
UNK: Like you'd believe that.
Joey : This sucks!
UNK: I'll be across the hall. And I promise you...
Chandler : the minute Monica and I break up, I'm moving right back in.
UNK: Maybe that's now.
