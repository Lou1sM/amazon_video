UNK: If you're gonna move in with him...
UNK: I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him.
UNK: He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
Joey : He forgets to...
Joey : He always, he always...
Joey : Who am I kidding? He's the best roommate!
UNK: -Hey, Phoebe. -Hey.
UNK: Oh, look, here's an article about people who marry people and don't tell them.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah, I'm reading Ross Geller Magazine.
Monica : Have you seen Rachel?
Phoebe : -No, why? -I have some exciting news.
UNK: You're pregnant.
UNK: No!
Monica : Chandler and I are moving in together.
UNK: Oh, that's good!
UNK: But if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.
UNK: What's up?
Monica : Chandler and I are moving in together.
Joey : Oh, my God.
UNK: Oh, my little sister and my best friend...
UNK: shacking up.
UNK: That's great. That's great.
UNK: Guys, I'm happy too.
Monica : Okay, come here.
Phoebe : Big day, huh? People moving in. People getting annulled.
Monica : I gotta go find Rachel.
UNK: If you see her, give her some really bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.
Phoebe : Something bad to tell Rachel.
Phoebe : Bad news for Rachel. What could that be?
UNK: Can you just lay off, please?
Ross : My life is an embarrassment. I should just go live under somebody's stairs.
UNK: It's not that big a deal. You'll have been divorced three times.
UNK: You'll have a life, you'll date..
UNK: No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
Ross : The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy...
Ross : Murderer Guy...
Ross : and geologists.
UNK: Ross, you're being ridiculous. You are cute and smart and sweet.
Phoebe : That is much more important than three stupid divorces.
UNK: Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?
UNK: That's not fair. Most guys that have been divorced three times are 60.
UNK: You're young.
UNK: That's true, I am young.
UNK: Well...
Phoebe : Nobody cares about this except you.
Phoebe : This embarrassment thing is all in your head.
UNK: -Here, I'll show you. Come here. -What?
UNK: Hi. My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time.
UNK: But wouldn't you date him?
Ross : And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Monica : Thought you were Rachel.
Chandler : What gave me away?
UNK: I gotta tell her.
Monica : I told Ross and Phoebe. She's the only one left.
UNK: It's official. We're moving in together.
Chandler : No turning back. Are you scared? Are you?!
UNK: No.
Chandler : That was my scariest voice. You're brave.
UNK: The worst day.
UNK: You're finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you Racquel.
Chandler : Listen, for the first four years of my work, everybody called me...
UNK: -Seriously. -I believe you.
UNK: It was in the middle of a meeting, so no one wants to correct her.
