UNK: It's your turn.
Chandler : Oh, are we playing this?
UNK: How'd the audition go?
UNK: Terrible. I messed up every word. I shouldn't even be an actor.
UNK: Wait. Are you pretending it didn't go well, but it really did go well?
UNK: -Yeah, did I fool you? -Totally!
Chandler : -So it did go well? -Amazingly well!
UNK: -Great! -It's down to me and two other guys.
UNK: And they're really good.
UNK: One's from those allergy commercials who's chased by flowers.
Ross : Oh, I love that guy!
Chandler : What are you doing?
Ross : What am I doing?
UNK: I'm so nervous, you know? The callback is tomorrow at 5 : 00.
UNK: -I feel like my head's gonna explode. -Well, it is overdue.
