UNK: -Don't worry. You'll be fine. -But it's so much pressure.
UNK: What you guys do is different. I don't know if you'd understand.
UNK: Yeah, we don't have pressure at our jobs.
Chandler : I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.
Monica : Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
Interviewer : -Is it dirty? -Don't worry, I'll wash it.
Interviewer : Don't. I like it dirty.
Monica : That's your call.
Interviewer : So what are you going to do next?
UNK: I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.
Interviewer : Are they firm?
UNK: -They're all right. -You sure they haven't gone bad?
UNK: You sure they're not very, very bad?
UNK: -No, really. They're okay. -You gonna slice them real nice?
Monica : Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.
UNK: I'm out of here.
UNK: I'm quitting. I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...
UNK: and she didn't even buy it.
UNK: I'm quitting. That's it. I'm talking to my boss right now.
Rachel : Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Rachel : Bye. Call me when you get this message.
Monica : Well, what happened?
Phoebe : Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until...
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
UNK: And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Monica : -Was it? -Boy Scouts could've camped under there.
Ross : You ate my sandwich?
UNK: It was a mistake. It could happen to anyone.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Dr. Leedbetter : Now calm down.
UNK: Dr. Leedbetter : Come look in my office. Some of it may still be in the trash.
UNK: -What? -Well, it was quite large.
UNK: Dr. Leedbetter : I had to throw most of it away.
UNK: You threw my sandwich away?
Ross : My sandwich?
Ross : My sandwich!
UNK: It's just, I want this part so much.
UNK: If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.
UNK: I didn't say that. That doesn't count.
UNK: Come on, guys. It's not like I moved to Europe.
UNK: I just moved across the hall.
UNK: And we would have you over all the time...
UNK: if it weren't for Monica's allergies.
UNK: You're right, I could never lie to you.
Chandler : She hates you.
UNK: Should I get that?
UNK: Hello? No, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message?
UNK: Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved from 5 : 00 to 2 : 30?
UNK: Okay, great. Bye.
UNK: -Aren't you dressed yet? -Am I naked again?
UNK: We're meeting my parents in 15 minutes.
Chandler : I was just talking to the guys. Look at them.
Chandler : Is it okay if they come visit?
Monica : What about my allergies?
Chandler : Right. Your allergies.
Chandler : All her. She hates you.
UNK: Yes! All right.
Joey : How cool would it be if you could watch a life-size version of this?
Joey : -I mean, how crazy would that be? -As crazy as soccer?
UNK: Hello?
Rachel : What are you talking about? The audition's at 5.
UNK: Well, nobody told me.
UNK: Who'd you talk to?
UNK: Never mind.
UNK: You mean you didn't get it from this?
Joey : -The allergy guy got the part. Thanks. -Maybe we can fix it.
Chandler : Maybe we can send him some big flowers and scare him!
