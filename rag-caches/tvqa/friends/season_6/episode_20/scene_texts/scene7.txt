UNK: What? It's 6 : 00!
UNK: Look! I wrote it on the board!

Chandler : I went to any place they make sandwiches!
UNK: -I can't believe this, Chandler! -I'm sorry.
UNK: -I don't know what to say! -You might say congratulations!
Joey : I saw the board, I went to the audition, I got the part!
UNK: Was that funny? I was worried.
Rachel : -I'm sorry. -That fake-out thing is just mean.
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
UNK: Well, that's good.
UNK: Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for you!
UNK: That's mean!

UNK: "Then I'll carry you!"
UNK: "That'll be a neat trick..."
UNK: "when you're dead!"
UNK: You don't have to yell.
Ross : There was just an explosion. My hearing would be impaired.
UNK: I thought you were great.
UNK: For a minute, I was like, "Where'd Ross go?"
UNK: Thank you. And that first scene where you meet Mac...
UNK: -Yeah? -Oh, my God. I mean...
UNK: And you know what?
UNK: That's enough for today. Thanks for your help.
Phoebe : -Holding us back. -Totally.
