Monica : People make mistakes. These things happen.
UNK: There aren't any messages you've forgotten to give me?
UNK: Apparently, you're not very good at it.
UNK: -Do you think he'll forgive me? -Of course.
UNK: The important thing is that you forgive yourself.
UNK: -You know what, I kind of have. -Already?
UNK: That was pretty bad what you did.
Monica : He will forgive you.
Monica : I like to bring a pad with me when I answer the phone, okay?
UNK: -You didn't see how mad he was. -I'm sure he'll forgive you.
UNK: We've all been there. You fight, you make up. That's how it works.
Ross : It took two people to break up this relationship!
UNK: Yeah! You and that copy girl...
Rachel : which yesterday you took responsibility for!
UNK: I didn't know what I was taking responsibility for.
UNK: -I didn't finish the letter. -What?
Ross : -I fell asleep. -You fell asleep?
UNK: It was 5 : 30 in the morning.
UNK: And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
UNK: Front and back!
UNK: And by the way? Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."
UNK: Y-O-U-R means "your."
UNK: I can't believe I thought of getting back together with you.
Rachel : We are so over!
Ross : Fine by me!
UNK: And just so you know, it's not that common...
UNK: it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!

Monica : Did you just flick me?
Rachel : Well, you wouldn't let me finish and..
UNK: Stop it!
UNK: -Stop. -Stop.
UNK: -All right. No, let's not do this. -No!
Phoebe : -Happy thoughts. -No!
Phoebe : -Happy thoughts. -No!
UNK: Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!
UNK: All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.
UNK: -Fine. -Fine.

Phoebe : You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would be my bitches.
UNK: Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
Joey : You hide my clothes? I'm wearing everything you own.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Joey : Look at me, I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Joey : Maybe if I wasn't going commando.
UNK: I tell you, it's hot with all this on. I'd better not do any lunges.
