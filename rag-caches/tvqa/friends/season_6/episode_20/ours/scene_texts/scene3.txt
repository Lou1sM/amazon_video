UNK: How could you do this? This could've turned my career around.
Chandler : I messed up, okay? I'm sorry. I really messed up.
UNK: Why'd you answer my phone?
UNK: -I have a machine! -Which I bought for you.
UNK: Taught you how to use it. You thought it was a copier.
Chandler : If there was anything I could do, I'd do it.
UNK: Everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
UNK: He could have gotten me a VCR or golf clubs.
Chandler : But no, he has to get me the "Woman Repeller."
Chandler : The eyesore from the "Liberace House of Crap!"
Phoebe : -It's not that bad. -Easy for you to say.
UNK: You don't have to sport a reject from the "Mr. T" collection.
Chandler : I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!
Chandler : I pity the fool that...
Chandler : When you were late last night, Kathy and I were talking and...
UNK: one thing led to another and...
Joey : And what? Did you sleep with her?
Chandler : -No! No, I just kissed her. -What? That's even worse!
UNK: -How? -I don't know! But it's the same!
Chandler : I have no excuses. I was over the line.
Chandler : Over the line?
UNK: You're so far past the line you can't even see it!
Joey : The line is a dot to you!
UNK: I'm not saying you should magically forgive me.
UNK: But you're not perfect. You've made errors in judgment.
Joey : Name one!
Monica : What happened?
Joey : Man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
Chandler : How were you locked in? And where the hell's all of our stuff?
UNK: This guy came to look at the unit...
UNK: and he didn't think it was big enough to fit a man.
UNK: So you got in voluntarily?
UNK: I was trying to make a sale!
UNK: If I ever run into him again, know what I'll do?
Chandler : Bend over?
UNK: There's Lori.
Chandler : Remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine : -Hi, Joey. -Hey.
Lorraine : Well, well. Look what you brought.
Chandler : And what did you bring?
UNK: She's checking her coat.
Lorraine : Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
Lorraine : Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice.
UNK: Janice?
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: Joey's tailor took advantage of me.
UNK: What?
Joey : No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
UNK: You said he'd do my inseam...
UNK: then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was...
UNK: What?
UNK: Cupping.
Joey : That's how they do pants!
UNK: -Isn't that how a tailor measures? -Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
Joey : I said name one!
