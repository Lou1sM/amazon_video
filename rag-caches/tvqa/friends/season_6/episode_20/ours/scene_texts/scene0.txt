UNK: "We've got 3 minutes till it blows. We won't make it!"
UNK: "You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!"
UNK: "I won't leave you."
UNK: "Don't worry about me. I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"
UNK: -"No, you're not. Not to me." -Oh, my God.
UNK: -What? -I am extremely talented.
UNK: -Yeah. You're great. -Yeah.
UNK: -Okay, let's take it from.. -No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.
Joey : I thought I was pretty good, too.
UNK: Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.
Joey : You know what? I think that's enough for now.
UNK: I don't want to be over-rehearsed.
UNK: Fine. I'll do it without you!
UNK: I don't need you or anybody else!
UNK: I'm gonna make it on my own!
UNK: You'll see! You'll all see!
UNK: The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
UNK: I'm a detective and I solve crimes with my robot partner.
UNK: He's a computerized humanoid...
Joey : electronically enhanced secret enforcer.
Joey : Or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
Rachel : -So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.? -That's the title!
UNK: They lucked out that the initials spell "cheese."
Chandler : That is lucky.
Rachel : So Joey, if you get this, you're gonna be, like...
Rachel : the star of your own TV show.
UNK: I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese" or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!
UNK: Don't get your hopes up. It probably won't happen.
Chandler : Why would you say that?
UNK: Well, I mean, come on, guys. My own TV show?
UNK: -I don't know if I'm good enough. -I am.
Rachel : What are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
Joey : -You really think so? -How can you even ask that question?
Chandler : -She's pretty. -Yeah. And she's really nice too.
Joey : She taught me all about how to work with cameras...
UNK: and "smell the fart" acting.
Rachel : -I'm sorry. What? -Excuse me?
Joey : It's like you got so many lines to learn so fast...
UNK: sometimes you need time to remember your next one.
UNK: So while you're thinking of it, you take this pause where you look intense.
UNK: You know, like this :
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Here's my scene! Here's my scene!
UNK: Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey, your sister's surgeon.
UNK: You sister is suffering from a...
UNK: Well, Eva, we've done some excellent work here.
UNK: And I would have to say your problem is quite clear.
UNK: All you want is a tinkle
UNK: What you envy's a schwang
UNK: A thing through which you can tinkle
UNK: Or play with or simply let hang
UNK: I play Al Pacino's butt.
Joey : All right?
UNK: He goes into the shower and then, I'm his butt.
Phoebe : -Oh, my God. -Come on, you guys.
UNK: This is a movie and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
UNK: It's terrific. You deserve this. After years of struggling...
UNK: you've finally cracked your way into show business.
UNK: Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care. This is a big break for me.
UNK: -No, you're right, it is. -Yeah.
Ross : So, you gonna invite us to the big opening?
UNK: All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.
UNK: Good luck, good luck We all wish you good luck
Joey : Yeah, whatever.
UNK: Wow, if I could dance, I'd be a triple threat.
