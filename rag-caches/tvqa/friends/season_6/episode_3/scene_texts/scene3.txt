UNK: Phoebe, I have to ask you..
UNK: I'm swamped right now.
UNK: You're just staring into space.
UNK: I'm trying to move that pencil.
Rachel : -This one? -It worked!
UNK: Phoebe, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.
UNK: Anything I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. Look.
UNK: "Wanted : Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
UNK: That's probably some 12-year-old kid trying to get girls to call.
UNK: There's nothing. This city is full.
UNK: Wait! Look at this!
Phoebe : "Two bedroom, two bath. Must be nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay."
UNK: Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Ross : -Rach, you still looking for a place? -Yeah, why?
Ross : This guy, Warren, from the museum is going on a dig for two years.
UNK: He's got this great place he needs to sublet. You interested?
UNK: Great! I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren!
UNK: Oh, wait. Is he the guy that asked you for naked pictures of me?
UNK: That doesn't matter, he won't be there!
Rachel : -Thank you! -Don't thank me.
Ross : Thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago...
Ross : killing, but perfectly preserving, an entire civilization.
UNK: Here's Warren's number.
UNK: This is great. I'm gonna call him right now! Thank you!
UNK: Okay, you go call him.
Phoebe : I saw it.
UNK: What are you talking about?
UNK: I'm talking about what you already know but won't admit.
UNK: You love her again. You re-love her.
Ross : I do not re-love her.
UNK: I can't believe you won't just admit it.
Phoebe : Promise me you won't do anything stupid.
UNK: We're just friends now. Why would I do anything stupid?
Rachel : The apartment is already subletted.
UNK: It's hopeless. I'll never find anything.
Ross : Live with me.
UNK: -What? -What?!
UNK: What?
Rachel : Are you serious?
Rachel : I would love to live with you. That's great. Thank you.
UNK: I'm just glad I could help you out.
UNK: Wow, I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, so, not stupid.
Rachel : Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.
Rachel : I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me. You're my hero.
UNK: Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.
Rachel : I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.
Ross : Oh, please.
UNK: You're gonna say things now, aren't you?
UNK: No. No, I won't.
Phoebe : But I should tell you this.
UNK: The same thing happened to my roommate, Denise.
Phoebe : She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her.
UNK: He said he didn't love her, but he really did. And it just blew up.
UNK: And that's how she ended up living with me.
UNK: Okay, that's a lie.
UNK: -You don't have a roommate. -Denise!
UNK: No one ever listens to me!
