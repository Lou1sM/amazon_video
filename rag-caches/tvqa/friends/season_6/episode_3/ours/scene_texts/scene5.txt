Ross : Enough of the silliness.
Chandler : Tell her to stop being silly.
Ross : Two very good points.
UNK: I've known you both a long time.
UNK: And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy...
UNK: as you've been since you got together.
Ross : Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
Ross : That is so silly.
UNK: What's more important, love...
Ross : or silliness?
Chandler : Well, we are fond of the silliness.
Chandler : But we also have a soft spot for the love.
Monica : -Love is the best medicine. -That's "laughter."
Monica : -Why do you do it? -I don't know.
UNK: Now, Chandler, you want to live with Monica, right?
Chandler : Yeah, I do.
UNK: And, Mon, you want to live with Chandler?
UNK: Yes.
Ross : A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
UNK: So I understand you're looking for a place?
UNK: No, I'm staying put.
Gunther : I was going to offer you my apartment.
UNK: Why? Where you going?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: You won't believe it.
Ross : Monica and Chandler are moving in again.
UNK: That's great news, right? I mean, for them, right?
Ross : But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
UNK: Yeah. You know, about that...
Rachel : I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything...
UNK: but don't you think it'll be weird?
UNK: Why? Why would it... Why would it be weird?
UNK: Well, you know, because of us.
Rachel : Because of our history.
UNK: No!
Ross : No, no!
UNK: It would only be weird if we were still in "that place."
Ross : Are you still in that place?
Rachel : -No, not at all. -Good. Me neither.
UNK: So it's not a problem.
UNK: We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
UNK: Okay, but eventually you and I will be dating.
Ross : Really? We are?
UNK: Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend and you'll have a girlfriend.
Phoebe : That'd be great.
UNK: But if you think it'll be okay, we'll just work out a system.
UNK: It'll be like in college. I'll hang a sign on the door :
Rachel : "Come back later. I'm getting lucky."
UNK: Yeah, I didn't think of that.
Ross : So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing?
UNK: It's a really big step. And what's the rush?
UNK: That's very funny.
UNK: He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.
UNK: No, I'm serious. Think about it. You move in.
UNK: You start fighting over game rooms. Next thing you know, you break up.
Monica : It was just a stupid fight about a room.
Ross : There are no stupid fights!
UNK: This isn't about the room.
Ross : This is about what the room represents.
Ross : And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!
Chandler : -I'm not so worried. -Me neither.
UNK: Fine. It's your life!
UNK: I just don't want to see you break up.
Ross : Which you will do if you move in together.
UNK: But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do.
UNK: Don't do it!
Monica : -You still want to move in together? -Of course.
UNK: Ross didn't scare you?
