UNK: Hey. That's my car.
UNK: Really?
Joey : Just give me five more minutes.
UNK: The Porsche Owner : What are you doing?
Joey : I found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
UNK: -But it's my car. -Yeah, but it's my wax.
UNK: Listen, I don't come to the city much.
UNK: I don't know if you're crazy or if this is some street theater...
UNK: The Porsche Owner : but could I have my keys?
UNK: Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.
UNK: I'm not coming back.
Joey : -Why not? -I live upstate.
Joey : Yeah, so did I.
UNK: I don't know why I was so nervous...
UNK: and why Frank and Alice complain. This is easy.
