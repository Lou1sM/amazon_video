Chandler : But you found the keys to his clothes?
UNK: No, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
UNK: They'll think you own one because of the clothes?
Joey : Of course.
Joey : Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.
Chandler : That is true.
Phoebe : Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
UNK: Oh, I've been there.
Joey : I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
UNK: You know you don't actually have one.
UNK: What are you doing? I'm in character. Will you talk to her?
Chandler : I think it just moved. It's poking me.
UNK: We'll go to the emergency room.
UNK: No, you can't leave me here with them. We're babysitting.
Monica : The babies are asleep. You'll be okay on your own.
UNK: You can't leave me with them. We're a team.
UNK: We're playing a zone. They'll triple-team me!
UNK: He's got plastic in his throat. We gotta go to the hospital.
UNK: But a doctor won't be able to help him. And it's just gonna...
Phoebe : naturally pass through his system in seven years.
UNK: -I think that's gum. -I'm pretty sure it's gun.
UNK: This really hurts. Let's go.
UNK: But no! A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.
UNK: No! What would Krog do?
UNK: Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
UNK: Maybe because you've got the keys?
UNK: -That was totally your fault. -My fault? You threatened the judge.
Rachel : You ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!
Ross : That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Joey : Hi. How are the Gellers?
UNK: Don't call us that.
UNK: The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce!
UNK: Did a Porsche throw up on you?
UNK: It's "Porsche-a"!
Phoebe : Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
Phoebe : You guys feel safe, right?
UNK: I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "Yeah, I do!"
UNK: Let's get rid of this dirty diaper. I'll set you up with a clean one.
UNK: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up.
UNK: Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.
Phoebe : I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way things go.
Phoebe : Okay. Good.
Phoebe : Why are there only two of you?
UNK: Where's Leslie?
UNK: Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?
Phoebe : Now would be a good time for your first words.
Phoebe : Well, look at you!
Phoebe : You are a little bit mischievous. My gosh!
UNK: Oh, you're a lot mischievous.
UNK: Well, it'll dry.
Phoebe : You sit with your brother and sister now...
UNK: who aren't there.
Phoebe : How do you feel?
UNK: Let's just say Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again...
