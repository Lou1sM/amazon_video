Ross : -Okay, Rach, but.. -You're peeping!
UNK: Ross, I just got..
Rachel : -Why did you do this? -I told you..
UNK: I don't wanna hear "three failed marriages."
UNK: If you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand.
UNK: Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.
UNK: Oh, I am so mad, Ross! I don't think I've ever been this angry!
UNK: What about when I said we were on a break?
UNK: Guy #1 : -Nice car. -Yeah, it's not mine.
Woman : -I love your car. -Yeah, it's mine.
UNK: -I bet it's fast. -Me too. Yeah.
Joey : And comfortable.
Joey : -You like leather seats? -Yeah.
UNK: It's got them!
UNK: Phoebe, how's it going?
UNK: I'm okay. Are they having fun? Am I talking too fast?
UNK: No. You sound like me.
UNK: It's going great. Look at Chandler with Little Baby Girl Chandler.
UNK: Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have I heard that before? Oh, Coach Rubin.
UNK: Phoebe, when you're done over there, we've got a situation over here too.
Phoebe : No. We are all responsible for our own babies.
UNK: That's where you're wrong. We've been playing them man-to-man.
Chandler : We should really be playing a zone defense.
Monica : What do you mean?
UNK: Things'll go smoother if we each have a zone. Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.
UNK: Mon, be in charge of diapering.
UNK: I'll be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands...
UNK: Sounds great, but you should be in charge of wiping.
UNK: Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Monica : This is so great. This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
UNK: Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.
Joey : Hey, guys.
Joey : Hey, babies.
UNK: I'm having the best morning.
UNK: That Porsche I've got the keys to? Still there.
Chandler : Shocking, since you still have the keys.
Joey : You should see the treatment I get with that car.
UNK: People are friendly. They wanna talk. And not just about the car.
UNK: One guy advised me on my equity investments.
Chandler : What equity investments?
Joey : The ones that got me the Porsche. Will you keep up?
UNK: If people see me just standing there, they're gonna think I don't own it.
UNK: So I figure I'll wash it. Monica, you got a bucket and soap?
Monica : Oh, yeah. I got soap and sponges and rags...
UNK: and carnauba wax and polishing compound.
UNK: You don't even have a car.
UNK: I know. Once there was a dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
UNK: -And? -And six others.
Chandler : There you are.
Joey : Yeah, she tops out at 130.
UNK: That's just in the city. I get her up to 160 upstate.
UNK: Guy #2 : Really? You got a place upstate?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: -All right. See you later. -Okay. Take it easy.
