UNK: You take scissors and cut..
Monica : Okay, okay, okay.
UNK: Making things sounds so much fun.
UNK: I thought so too, until I papier-mached one of my eyes shut.
UNK: I love papier-mache! What did you make?
UNK: I made a flar-lar-lar.
Phoebe : -What is that? -Nothing!
Ross : So, what are you gonna do?
UNK: Have you made anything I can take credit for?
Phoebe : I have, I have! I started making little sock bunnies!
Phoebe : Oh, for crying out loud!
Rachel : Wait a minute. That is my sock!
UNK: Now it's your little bunny friend.
