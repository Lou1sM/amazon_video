UNK: Remember that jacket you loved that was too expensive?
Chandler : You have done enough.
UNK: I'll wake up early and get it.
UNK: No, you don't.. Get it in black, not brown.
Monica : Your cake is ready.
UNK: It's like that old saying, "Have sex, eat some cake."
UNK: Joey's Look-a-like : Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan. Just getting a soda.
Monica : Who the hell are you?
UNK: I'm Joey.
UNK: How are you doing?
Joey : No! No! No! No! No!
UNK: How you doing?
UNK: How you doing? Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall.
UNK: I've got to apologize on behalf of Carl.
Chandler : Who the hell is Carl?
Joey : Did I not mention?
UNK: Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin for a medical research project.
Chandler : Sometimes the good ideas are right in front of you.
UNK: It sounds crazy, but it might work. The only problem is Carl's acting...
Joey : The only problem?
UNK: He's the reason I didn't get that big commercial a couple of years ago.
Joey : We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed up.
UNK: Can I get a piece of that cake?
Joey : Pizza! We like pizza! Get out!
Phoebe : -Pat Sajak? -Yep.
Phoebe : -Alex Trebek? -Of course.
Phoebe : -Chuck Woolery? -Definitely.
UNK: You will not find a single game-show host whose ass I cannot kick.
Rachel : -Say it! -Say we are unagi!
UNK: It's not something you are, it's something you have.
Rachel : Say it!
UNK: I could easily get out of this...
UNK: but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt!
UNK: Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is this not gonna be?
Carl : -Another Minute Maid fiasco. -That's right.
Joey : And what are you not gonna do?
UNK: -I'm not gonna talk because.. -Damn it, Carl!
UNK: The Doctor : Can I have the next one, please?
Monica : Thank you.
UNK: The Doctor : Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
UNK: That's us.
UNK: The Doctor : But this is a study for identical twins.
UNK: That's right. $2000.
UNK: But you're not identical twins.
UNK: Damn it, Carl!
Chandler : Oh, my good God.
