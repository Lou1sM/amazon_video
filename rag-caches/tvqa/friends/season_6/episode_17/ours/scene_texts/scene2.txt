UNK: Okay...
UNK: This actually is a flar-lar-lar.
UNK: Can I ask about the Valentine's Day gifts?
UNK: -Yeah. -Do we have to make the entire thing?
UNK: Yes. Did you forget to make yours?
Chandler : Of course not.
UNK: I just have to go to the place where I made it and pick it up.
UNK: I can't wait. It'll be the best Valentine's Day ever!
UNK: I can't believe it! Make the presents!
UNK: -What? -Just so excited to make the presents!
UNK: Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: With all due respect, I'd like to donate some fluids.
UNK: We're at the end of a research cycle and not looking for applicants now.
UNK: That's too bad. I've been saving up.
UNK: You sure there's no studies I can participate in?
UNK: -Here's a schedule. -Thanks.
Joey : This one starts now.
Receptionist : Only identical twins are eligible. It's a twin study.
UNK: But it's $2000!
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: And this?
UNK: "Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani on Attractive Nurse Receptionist."
UNK: Results are back on that one. They're not good.
UNK: -That was good. -Yeah.
Ross : Danger! Danger!
Rachel : What the hell was that?
Ross : A lesson in the importance of unagi.
UNK: You're a freak!
UNK: Perhaps.
UNK: Now I'm curious.
Ross : At what point during those girlish screams would you have kicked my ass?
UNK: All right, so we weren't prepared!
UNK: I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point.
UNK: I just want you to be safe.
UNK: Danger!
UNK: Ah-ha!
UNK: Unagi!
Joey : 2000 bucks is a lot of money.
Joey : I wish I had a twin.
Joey : Where could I find someone...
Joey : who looks exactly like me?
UNK: Chandler.
Ross : I sensed it was you.
UNK: What?
UNK: Unagi.
UNK: I'm always aware.
UNK: Are you aware that unagi is an eel?
UNK: -What's up? -I can't figure out what to make Monica.
UNK: Why don't you make her one of your little jokes?
UNK: I'm going crazy. Do you have anything homemade?
UNK: You know what? She'd love this.
UNK: It's a replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Chandler : I could use that. I could say, "Your love sends me to the moon."
UNK: Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.
UNK: You can say, "Your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
UNK: I can't give this to her.
Ross : -Why not? -It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
UNK: And it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
UNK: Danger!
