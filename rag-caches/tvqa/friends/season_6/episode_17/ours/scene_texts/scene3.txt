UNK: Salmon-skin roll.
Chandler : Yes, honey, I made it myself.
UNK: I can't do it. I can't do it.
Chandler : A mixed tape! A mixed tape!
UNK: Hi! Ready to exchange gifts?
UNK: -Sure. You go first. -Okay, come here.
UNK: Okay, it's not wrapped because I just finished it.
Chandler : But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Monica : What a great gift!
UNK: Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?
UNK: We'll have to listen and see.
Monica : Oh, I love it! Thank you so much.
Monica : You ready to open yours?
UNK: It's a sock bunny.
Monica : Remember how I call you bunny?
Chandler : Not really.
Monica : I did one time. And I want to start doing it more.
UNK: -That's what this is about. -I see.
Chandler : Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
UNK: No, she doesn't. What she makes, they're sock rabbits.
Monica : They're completely different. Okay, okay.
UNK: I didn't make it!
UNK: I forgot about tonight and that we're supposed to make the presents.
UNK: It's okay.
UNK: No, it's not okay.
UNK: You're so incredible.
Monica : You went through all this time and effort to make this tape.
UNK: I'll make this up to you. I will.
UNK: I am going to cook you anything you want in here.
UNK: And I'm going to do anything you want in there.
Chandler : Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape.
UNK: You are way too young to have seen that.
UNK: Your birthday's in a month and a half.
UNK: What if I forget to get you a present for that too?
Chandler : You are totally and completely 100 percent forgiven.
UNK: We've got to wash that.
