UNK: I'm willing to offer her things that you aren't.
UNK: I'm willing to offer her those things. I had a plan...
UNK: to throw her off so when I offered all these things, she'd be surprised.
Richard : If it helps, it worked very well.
UNK: It was working till you showed up, you big tree.
UNK: This isn't fair.
Chandler : You had your chance with her, and you blew it!
UNK: This is my chance. I won't blow it, because we are meant for each other.
UNK: And this has all just been one stupid mistake!
Chandler : I was gonna propose tonight.
Richard : -You were gonna propose? -Yeah, I even...
UNK: got a ring. Did you get a ring?
UNK: No, I don't have a ring.
Richard : You go get her, Chandler.
Richard : And can I give you a piece of advice?
Richard : If you do get her...
UNK: don't let her go.
Richard : Trust me.
UNK: You know, Richard, you are a good guy.
Phoebe : I know.
Richard : I hate that.
UNK: -I've gotta find Monica. -She's gone.
UNK: -What? -She had a bag and she left.
UNK: -What? -She was all crying...
Joey : She said you guys want different things.
UNK: -Why didn't you tell her it was a plan? -I told her everything.
UNK: -But she wouldn't believe me. -Well, where..? Where did she go?
UNK: To her parents'. She said you shouldn't call. But if I were you, I would.
UNK: -I can't believe I ruined this. -I am so sorry, man.
Monica : You wanted it to be a surprise.
Rachel : Oh, my God.
UNK: Chandler...
Monica : in all my life...
Monica : I never thought I would be so lucky...
UNK: as to fall in love with my best...
Monica : My best...
UNK: There's a reason why girls don't do this!
UNK: I'll do it. I thought...
UNK: Wait, I can do this.
Chandler : I thought that it mattered...
Chandler : what I said or where I said it.
Chandler : Then I realized...
Chandler : the only thing that matters is that you...
Chandler : You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
UNK: And if you let me...
UNK: I'll spend all my life trying to make you feel the same way.
UNK: Monica...
Chandler : will you marry me?
UNK: Yes.
Monica : I knew you were likely to take a wife!
UNK: Can we come in yet? We're dying out here!
Monica : Come in! Come in!
UNK: We're engaged!
Rachel : This is the least jealous I've ever been.
UNK: Oh, no, wait! This is wrong! Ross isn't here!
UNK: Hell, he's done it three times. He knows what it's about!
