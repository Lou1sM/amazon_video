Joey : Richard said he wants to marry you?
UNK: -And Chandler says he hates marriage? -That's right.
Joey : Chandler loves marriage!
UNK: You just said he hates marriage!
UNK: "He's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife"!
UNK: "He's against marriage and always will be"!
Joey : You got that from what I said?
UNK: After the Cretaceous Period, the dinosaurs were gone.
Ross : What happened, you guys?
UNK: -Rach. -Hey, you.
Waitress : -Come on in. -Thank you.
UNK: I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
UNK: Thanks. I really thought we'd be able to make it work.
UNK: I guess it wasn't meant to be.
Rachel : Yeah. Love. It's a tricky business, isn't it?
Ross : -I guess so. -So, what do you say we make a pact?
UNK: If you and I are both single by 40, we get married.
Rachel : I mean, we know each other, we like each other...
UNK: we've already slept together, so there'll be no surprises.
UNK: No, like, "What's that?"
UNK: -Oh, you want me to be your backup. -Exactly.
Ross : Yeah. I already have one.
Rachel : -What? Who? -Phoebe.
UNK: Phoebe?
UNK: But she just said Joey is her backup.
UNK: Oh, I don't think so.
UNK: We just spoke. She said that she and Joey made a deal.
UNK: That's impossible. We have had a deal for years. We shook on it.
Ross : Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that.
UNK: Gunther, it's Joey. Is Chandler there?
UNK: Listen. What kind of muffins do they serve at sea?
Joey : Where the hell have you been?!
Chandler : I was making a coconut phone with the Professor.
Joey : Richard told Monica he wants to marry her.
UNK: -What? -I've been trying to find you.
UNK: And I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
Rachel : -Oh, my God! -I know! They suck!
UNK: He's not supposed to ask her to marry him! I am!
Phoebe : -I know! -What..?
UNK: You know what I'll do? I'll go over there and kick his ass!
Chandler : Will you help me?
UNK: Look, I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution, okay?
UNK: -Look, just go and find Monica. -You're right.
UNK: Okay. I'm gonna get the ring...
UNK: I'm gonna go find her and I'm gonna propose!
UNK: Dude! Dude! Dude!
Joey : That coconut phone might be good for the boat.
