Richard : That might be fun.
Rachel : -What were you thinking? -I didn't know it was an auction.
UNK: I figured I'd take a guess. Help a charity. Free boat!
UNK: Why would a charity give away a boat?
UNK: I don't know. Charity?
Phoebe : Well, just buy the damn boat.
UNK: Don't you think you've had enough to drink?
UNK: I'm just helping the kids.
Rachel : How is you drinking helping the kids?
Phoebe : Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
UNK: Mr. Thompson : Mr. Tribbiani, your contribution brings us...
UNK: a step closer to building the youth center.
UNK: -I'm so happy you brought him. -So am I.
UNK: I'm curious. How much is that boat worth?
UNK: Mr. Thompson : -I think it was valued at 19,000. -Hey, I was pretty close.
Joey : So, bad news.
UNK: I can't buy the boat. I don't have any money.
UNK: Joey! Joey, good one. He's silly.
UNK: Mr. Thompson : Good! Very good!
UNK: -So I think I'm gonna take off now. -You can't leave, Joey!
Rachel : You agreed to buy that boat. It's a contract.
Rachel : Plus, if you leave, my boss will kill me.
UNK: I don't have that kind of money.
UNK: I know. Okay, okay. This is what we'll do.
UNK: We'll let the next highest bidder buy it.
UNK: Then you'll pay the difference.
UNK: Okay. I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.
Joey : They should just watch TV after school like I did. I turned out fine.
Rachel : Not great.
UNK: I'm helping the kids so much I think I'm gonna throw up.
UNK: So we're hiding in the bathroom...
UNK: I get out. But before she can, her parents come in.
Monica : I hide in the shower. They start going at it on the floor.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Chandler : I got a good one.
Chandler : I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
UNK: It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast.
Richard : As a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship...
Richard : Let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures.
UNK: In the dew of little things, the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
UNK: What?
Ross : Oh, my God! You guys!
Chandler : Have we got a story for you. Guess who we bumped into?
UNK: -Who? -Richard!
UNK: Right, that's Richard's favorite place too.
Chandler : -Oh, you knew that? Good. -Weren't you going out with Elizabeth?
UNK: I was. She was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Monica : Sometimes grownups have commitments they can't get out of.
Ross : Maybe she is too young for me.
Ross : When I was over there, I felt like I was a babysitter.
UNK: I see what you were talking about. I don't know what to do.
UNK: Weigh the good stuff about her against the bad.
UNK: That's what I did when I first started... weighing stuff.
UNK: Okay, bad stuff. I'm 12 years older than she is.
UNK: The school could fire you.
UNK: -She's leaving for three months. -For camp.
Ross : Okay, good stuff.
UNK: Well, she's sweet and pretty and..
UNK: And the sex is probably great, huh?
UNK: It's tender and respectful, if that's what you mean.
UNK: The only thing you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?"
Monica : Do you see yourself marrying her?
UNK: My God. You married her, didn't you?
UNK: No, I didn't do that. It's just...
Ross : Okay, honestly, no. I don't see a big future with her.
UNK: Okay, I think that's your answer.
UNK: I gotta talk to her. I hate this part.
UNK: Forget Elizabeth. If you're not careful...
Chandler : you may not get married at all this year.
UNK: -Weren't you supposed to do something? -Good luck with Elizabeth, my man.
UNK: My God, Phoebe, how many have you had?
UNK: 1, 2, 3... Seven times three.. 21!
UNK: -You must be just wasted! -I'm a little tired.
Joey : -Next highest bidder is at table one. -Great.
UNK: The guy with the Paris trip is at table four.
