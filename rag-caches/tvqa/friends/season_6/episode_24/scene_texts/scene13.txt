UNK: Hi.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: I don't know why I'm here.
UNK: I didn't ask.
Richard : -You wanna come in? -I don't know.
Phoebe : Oh, okay.
UNK: I'll just leave the door open and sit on the couch.
Monica : -Chandler is such an idiot! -Drink?
Chandler : -Scotch on the.. -Rocks with a twist?
Chandler : I remember.
UNK: You still smoking cigars?
UNK: No, no. That's art.
Richard : If it bothers you, I can put my art out.
UNK: No, that's okay.
Richard : So, Monica, let me ask you a question.
Richard : Since we broke up, do you ever...
Richard : think about me?
Monica : Actually, I thought about you a few months ago.
UNK: -Really? -But it's because...
Monica : I had an eye exam, and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Richard : -Who is it? -Edward Nevsky.
UNK: He's no good.
Richard : Do you ever think about me...
UNK: -in a non-eye-doctor way? -No.
UNK: Because getting over you was the hardest thing I've ever done.
Monica : I never let myself think about you.
UNK: Wow.
Rachel : Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?
UNK: -You can't have two backups! -Of course I can.
UNK: It's good sense to back up your backup.
UNK: -Look, I've already lost Chandler. -What?
UNK: Hey, Phoebe! We're both your backup?
Ross : How could you do this to me?
UNK: Why are you complaining? You were both aware of the situation.
Ross : -I was not! -No, we weren't!
UNK: This kind of backtalk won't fly when we're married.
UNK: You can't have both. Pick one.
Joey : -Pick me! -No, pick me!
UNK: -I don't wanna end up an old maid. -All right. Well, let's see.
Phoebe : Ross is a good father.
UNK: But...
UNK: Joey has a boat. This is hard.
Richard : This is crazy. I wanna switch to Rachel.
Ross : -I wanna switch to Rachel too. -No, wait. Just wait.
UNK: Wait, guys. Don't make any rash decisions.
UNK: Just remember my promise :
UNK: If we get married, three times a week.
UNK: Oh, my God. Phoebe...
UNK: I'm talking about massages.
UNK: No, I'm not.
