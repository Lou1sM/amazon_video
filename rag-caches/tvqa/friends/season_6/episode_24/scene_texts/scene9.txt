Joey : And, also, a little like a French guy.
Joey : I never noticed that before.
Monica : -What are you up to? -Hanging out. Talking about websites.
UNK: We saw this interesting website about marriage...
UNK: and how unnecessary it is, a way for the government to keep tabs.
Joey : Yeah, Big Brother.
UNK: That's a bit crazy.
UNK: Although I am glad you're looking at other things on the Internet.
Chandler : Got me thinking. Why would anybody want to get married?
UNK: To celebrate the relationship, solidify the commitment...
Monica : declare your love for one another to the world.
UNK: Well, that's good to know.
UNK: The Mr. Bowmont is here!
UNK: A diner wants to compliment you. Shall I let him in?
Monica : Sure. I love this part.
Waitress : -Come on in. -Hi.
UNK: -Richard. -I'm not here to compliment the chef.
Monica : I hate when people come back to compliment the chef.
Monica : Like I have nothing better to do.
UNK: So, what's up?
Richard : It was great seeing you the other night.
Monica : Good to see you too.
UNK: -You came to tell me that? -I came to tell you something else.
Richard : I came here to tell you I still love you.
UNK: What? What did you..? What?
Richard : I still love you.
UNK: I know I shouldn't even be here telling you this.
UNK: You're with Chandler, who I like.
UNK: If you say he's straight, I'll believe you.
UNK: After seeing you, I knew if I didn't tell you I'd regret it.
Richard : Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
UNK: You're really not supposed to be back here.
UNK: I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place...
UNK: but I had to tell you.
Richard : I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you.
Richard : I wanna have kids with you.
Rachel : Oh, my God. Why don't they put chairs back here?
UNK: Look, I know this is crazy, but am I too late?
UNK: You're too late. Where was all this three years ago?
Richard : I know. I was an idiot.
Richard : I tried to forget you. I really did.
UNK: After our last lunch, I spent six months in Africa trying to forget.
UNK: -What did you do there? -Work with blind kids.
Monica : What are you doing to me?
Joey : Look, I...
UNK: I'm sorry, but this is not gonna happen.
UNK: That's fine. I'll walk away. I'll never bother you again.
UNK: Only if you say Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
UNK: Well, he is. I mean...
Monica : marriage is all he talks about. My goodness!
UNK: In fact, I'm the one making him wait.
UNK: You are? Why?
UNK: Why?
Monica : Because of the government.
UNK: Isn't it incredible?
Chandler : Monica and Chandler are getting married.
UNK: I know. They'll be so happy together.
UNK: How often do two best friends fall in love?
Phoebe : -Not that often. -No.
UNK: -I'm so happy for them. -Me too. So happy for them.
