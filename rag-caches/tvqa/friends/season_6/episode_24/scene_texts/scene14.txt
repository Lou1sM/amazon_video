UNK: I know how to settle it. We'll do this.
UNK: I'm gonna write "Joey" on one napkin...
UNK: and "Ross" on the other napkin and we're gonna pick one.
UNK: That person will be our backup. Okay?
UNK: -Sounds fair. -All right.
UNK: Good. Switching them up.
Rachel : -Pick one. -Left.
Monica : -Thank you. -You're welcome.
UNK: -Ross. -Joey.
UNK: -We should switch. -Absolutely.
Monica : I missed you, you ugly flat-faced old freak.
Phoebe : Excuse me?
UNK: Him.
Monica : I missed this apartment. Now, this is a grownup's apartment.
UNK: I should be with a grownup, you know?
UNK: You're saying you need to be with someone more mature.
Richard : Maybe someone with...
Richard : a license to practice medicine.
Richard : Or a mustache.
UNK: Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.
UNK: I need someone who wants the same things.
UNK: Coming to my work and telling me you love me, I want that!
Monica : Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
UNK: I think that's fair.
UNK: Please, don't even talk to me about fair.
UNK: Fair would've been you wanting to marry me then.
UNK: Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.
Monica : Believe me, nothing about this is fair. Nothing.
Monica : -Nothing! Nothing! -It's okay.
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: I don't know.
Phoebe : I know.
UNK: I have to figure some..
Monica : Some stuff, before I can...
Richard : I understand.
Richard : Take as much time as you want.
UNK: Ten, even 20 minutes, if you need it.
UNK: I'll be here. Not smoking.
Chandler : Where is she?
UNK: I'm not scared of you.
UNK: She's not here. And please come in.
Chandler : Scotch on the rocks...
Chandler : with a twist, on a coaster.
UNK: Monica?
Richard : Okay, she was here. But she left.
Chandler : Where did she go?
Richard : She said she had to think things over.
UNK: Oh, my God. I can't believe this. I thought you were a good guy.
Richard : Look, nothing happened.
UNK: Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend you love her?
Richard : Well, all right, one thing happened.
Chandler : You know what you did? My girlfriend is thinking things over.
Chandler : You made my girlfriend think!
UNK: Well, I'm sorry.
UNK: -What's to think about? I love her. -Well...
