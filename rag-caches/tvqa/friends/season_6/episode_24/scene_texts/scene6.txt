UNK: -Why do you care about who won? -It's a trip for two.
Phoebe : Excuse me.
Phoebe : Is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
UNK: Emil Alexander : -That was me. -Enchante.
Joey : -Is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table? -That's me.
Rachel : Well, hello. This is your lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.
UNK: The Gentleman Daysailer has become available again...
UNK: and I believe you made a bid of $18,000.
Joey : You have to pay that. It's not just a guess.
UNK: I was relieved I didn't win. My wife would've killed me.
UNK: You kidding? She'll love this boat!
UNK: -What is your wife's name? -Pam.
UNK: Just imagine this : The Pam.
UNK: I don't think she'd like that.
UNK: Okay. Imagine this : The Mr. Bowmont.
UNK: -I don't think so. -Let me paint you a little picture.
UNK: You are setting sail up the Hudson. You've got the wind in your... arms.
Rachel : You get all that peace and quiet you've always wanted.
Rachel : You get back to nature. You can go fishing.
UNK: You get one of those hats. People call you captain.
UNK: And then when you're old, Cappy.
UNK: -It's for a good cause. All right. -No way! It's mine!
UNK: What?
UNK: -The stuff you said, I want that! -But you don't have $20,000!
UNK: Who cares? I'll make payments! I want the Mr. Bowmont!
UNK: -Oh, my God. You're back. -Let me see it. Let me see your hand.
UNK: Why do you wanna see my hand?
UNK: I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
UNK: It's all dirty. You should throw this out.
UNK: -What did you just do? -What happened?
UNK: -Richard was there. I couldn't do it. -Oh, no.
UNK: I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.
UNK: -Now you've ruined it. -We didn't.
UNK: Who walks in a room and asks to see a person's hands?
Phoebe : A palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Joey : -Glove salesman. -Good one!
UNK: This is terrible. What will I do?
Phoebe : She only suspects something. So just throw her off the track.
UNK: I'll pretend marriage is the last thing on my mind.
UNK: Convince her you're scared of commitment, that you're a coward.
Phoebe : I can do that. I've had years of practice.
Joey : Being you is finally gonna pay off!
Monica : Some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes.
UNK: That guy is still doing that?
UNK: Oh, my God. Let me see your hand!
UNK: You're too late! She already took out the trash!
