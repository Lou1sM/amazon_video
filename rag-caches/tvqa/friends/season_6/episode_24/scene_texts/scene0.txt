Ross : God, that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Rachel : You should know. You bought, like, a billion of them.
UNK: You didn't get one.
UNK: -Tonight's the big night. -How you gonna ask her?
UNK: We're gonna go to her favorite restaurant.
UNK: I'm gonna get her favorite champagne. She'll know how expensive it is.
Chandler : When the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast, I'm gonna propose.
UNK: It sounds perfect!
UNK: -You'll mess it up. Let me do it. -I won't mess it up.
Phoebe : -If she says no, can I have the ring? -She won't say no.
UNK: If.
UNK: -Sure. -What about me? I want it too.
UNK: -She won't say no. -I'll let you borrow it.
Waitress : Hey, Monica.
UNK: -Give it. -It's gone.
UNK: Phoebe.
Waitress : Hey, Monica!
UNK: We're practically kissing.
UNK: The One With the Proposal
UNK: We can't go. We're going to dinner. Remember?
UNK: -Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. -What's the big deal?
UNK: I get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Joey : Where are you going?
Rachel : -How about you guys? -Open bar?
Rachel : -I think so. -I can do that for the kids.
UNK: I'll come. I'm making money. It's time I give some back.
UNK: You could give back the money you owe me.
Joey : Okay. Have a benefit.
UNK: Ross, can you go to a charity event tonight?
Ross : I have plans with Elizabeth.
UNK: You're already doing your part for the kids.
UNK: It's our last night before she leaves for camp. To be a counselor.
UNK: I have a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Monica : All jokes aside? I didn't agree to that.
UNK: -Do you see this as long-term? -I don't know.
Phoebe : -You are 12 years older than her. -Who's counting?
UNK: Well, she is. She's this many.
UNK: Ross, she is really young.
Ross : Does everyone feel this way?
All : -Yeah, sort of. -Sorry.
UNK: I thought you were just making jokes. I had no idea.
Ross : You guys are wrong. Yes, there is a chronological age difference.
Ross : But I never notice it, because she is very mature.
UNK: It doesn't matter what you guys think. I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.
Joey : Not what she said last night.
