UNK: Have you guys seen Chandler?
UNK: No. But you know who was looking for you?
UNK: Tennille.
UNK: The marriage stuff you were saying yesterday? You don't believe that.
Chandler : Sure, I do. In fact, I think the concept of marriage is unnatural.
UNK: Look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs.
UNK: Pigs don't mate for life.
UNK: A pig can have 100 sexual partners in a lifetime.
UNK: That's an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports.
UNK: Yeah, but that's pigs, not people.
UNK: If marriage worked, I'd be for it. Do you know the divorce rate?
UNK: Ninety-seven percent!
Chandler : Wait a minute.
UNK: Are you telling me you may never want to get married?
UNK: -Who's to say? -You! You are to say!
UNK: Never say never, but, probably...
Chandler : yeah, never.
UNK: Oh, my God. Then what are we even doing? What is this?
Chandler : Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is all this pressure?
UNK: Is this some new strategy?
UNK: Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules, huh, mantrap?
UNK: You know what? I gotta go.
UNK: It's okay. I got a plan.
UNK: -We're gonna find love. -Definitely.
UNK: Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.
UNK: That's what makes it so easy to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler.
UNK: -A guarantee would be nice. -What do you mean?
UNK: Some friends make a deal.
Rachel : Like if neither of them are married by 40, they marry each other.
Phoebe : -A backup? -Exactly.
UNK: Yeah, I've got that.
Rachel : You do?
UNK: -Who? -Joey.
UNK: -Joey? Are you serious? -I locked him in years ago.
UNK: Wait. So if neither of you are married by 40, you'll marry Joey?
Phoebe : Yep. We shook on it.
Phoebe : But believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Rachel : Oh, seriously?
Phoebe : I think his exact words were..
UNK: Charming.
UNK: He's just a backup.
Waitress : -Hey, Monica. -Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
UNK: -It's for my boat. Pretty cool, huh? -Yeah, it's great.
UNK: What's wrong? Talk to the captain.
UNK: Just realizing I'm in a dead-end relationship.
UNK: -Chandler being difficult? -I don't want marriage tomorrow.
UNK: But I wanna know we're going somewhere, that I'm not wasting time.
Joey : -You know Chandler. -No, I don't know Chandler.
Monica : Not anymore. It's like something's changed.
Joey : -Maybe you changed. -I didn't change.
UNK: Maybe that's the problem.
UNK: -What? -Chandler is a complex fellow.
Joey : One who is unlikely to take a wife.
Monica : Is that some kind of boat talk?
UNK: I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Monica : Does he think I'll wait around for nothing?
Joey : Face it. Chandler is against marriage.
Joey : And always will be.
UNK: There's some people who do wanna marry me.
Joey : -There are? -Yeah. Richard.
