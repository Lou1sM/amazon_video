Monica : We know you steal our food.
UNK: I'm good.
Monica : Drapes still closed?
UNK: Yeah. That perverted couple two doors over should've shut theirs.
Chandler : -Is that a swing? -Oh, don't even ask.
UNK: I can't believe Ross is with her sister.
UNK: When Chandler kissed my sister, I was mad for 10 years.
UNK: -That was five years ago. -You got five years left.
UNK: -Joey.. -Want to make it six?
Rachel : So how was your big date last night?
UNK: It was okay. It was fun.
Ross : It was fun? Great.
Rachel : So did you guys hit it off?
Ross : I guess so.
Rachel : So did anything happen? Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.
Ross : No. No. Nothing happened.
Ross : I shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Rachel : Oh, slides!
Rachel : So really nothing happened.
UNK: Something could've happened.
Ross : She really dug my slides.
Ross : And she was definitely giving me the vibe.
UNK: Was it the "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe?
UNK: I'm telling you, she was in to me, okay?
UNK: Hey, you remembered trilobite.
UNK: Anyway...
UNK: If she wasn't into me, why would she ask me out again?
UNK: -She asked you out again? -Yeah.
UNK: Tomorrow night. Valentine's Day. The most romantic day of the year.
Ross : Who knows what could happen.
Ross : I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides.
Rachel : Okay! I got it, I got it.
UNK: I can't go with the "you and my sister" thing.
UNK: It's just too weird, all right?
Rachel : I imagine the two of you together.
UNK: It just freaks me out. I can't do it!
UNK: It's okay.
UNK: It's too weird for you. I won't see her again.
Rachel : Thank you.
Ross : After tomorrow night.
UNK: No! I can't do it. It's gonna freak me out!
Ross : Okay, okay, okay!
UNK: Okay. I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Rachel : Ross, thanks.
UNK: Want me to call her now?
UNK: Oh, no. No, no, no.
UNK: No. Come on, I mean, that's crazy.
UNK: So, what's going on with you?
UNK: Well...
UNK: I may teach another class this semester.
UNK: Do it now. Call her now.
Monica : -This is my favorite part. -Me too.
UNK: I don't know what you guys are so sad about. It all works out.
UNK: E.T. stays with Elliott, and they get to be best friends forever.
UNK: You've seen this movie before, E.T. goes back home.
UNK: What?
UNK: Oh, no, I forgot.
UNK: You know what's sadder than this? Bambi.
Phoebe : I cried for three days with that movie. No, two.
UNK: The third day my mom killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.
UNK: Well, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon.
UNK: You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Chandler : Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.
UNK: If this movie's making you guys cry so much, let's just change the channel.
UNK: There.
UNK: Joey, you're crying over a Doritos commercial.
UNK: I was up for that part.
UNK: It's okay to cry. You don't have to be macho all the time.
UNK: I'm not macho.
UNK: Yeah, you're right.
UNK: I don't know what I was thinking.
Chandler : I just never really cried. I'm not a crying kind of guy.
UNK: Come on, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up. Like...
Joey : What if you saw a three-legged puppy?
UNK: I'd be sad, sure.
UNK: But I wouldn't cry.
Joey : What if the puppy said, "Help me, Chandler.
Joey : All the other puppies pick on me."
Chandler : Cry? I just found a talking puppy. I'm rich!
UNK: I've got it. I have got it.
Monica : Pictures from your childhood.
Monica : This'll get you going good.
UNK: Oh, what's going on there?
UNK: Parents' Day. First grade.
UNK: That's me with the janitor, Martin.
Monica : -Where are your parents? -They didn't want to come.
UNK: -Chandler! -Poor thing.
