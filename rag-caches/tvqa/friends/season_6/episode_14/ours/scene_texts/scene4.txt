Monica : Hey, sweetie.
UNK: "Chicken Soup for the Soul"?
UNK: There's no back to this couch.
Monica : You hate this kind of stuff.
UNK: I figured I'd give it a shot.
UNK: One of the stories may make me cry, then you won't think I'm dead inside.
UNK: Oh, that's so sweet.
UNK: I don't care if you can't cry. I love you.
Chandler : Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Monica : Stop it.
UNK: Seriously. We get married, I'm up at the altar and I'm like this :
UNK: I won't care.
UNK: I know that you'll be feeling it all in here.
UNK: -Yeah? -Yeah.
UNK: And if we have a baby one day...
Monica : and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room...
UNK: and you don't cry, so what?
Monica : If we take him to college and come home...
UNK: and we see his empty room for the first time...
Monica : and you got nothing?
UNK: It won't matter to me.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I won't worry about this anymore then.
UNK: And then, you know, if I die...
Monica : from a long illness...
UNK: and you're writing my eulogy...
UNK: and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says :
Monica : "I will always be with you"...
UNK: and you still can't shed one tiny tear?
Monica : I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Monica : -I love you. -What is wrong with you?!
UNK: -What? -What?
UNK: You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?
Monica : I left you a note from the beyond!
UNK: -So you didn't mean any of that? -No, you robot!
Ross : You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time and I swear..
UNK: Oh, Jill!
UNK: That's a game I play with the kids down the hall.
UNK: They've really taken a liking to me.
UNK: What's the matter?
UNK: Rachel and I had a big fight. Can I come in?
UNK: I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore.
UNK: I don't know anybody in this city and I need somebody to talk to.
UNK: Sure. What happened?
UNK: I don't want to talk about it.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: -You know what might cheer me up? -What?
Jill : Seeing some more of your super cool slides.
Ross : -Wow, really? -Totally. I loved them.
Jill : You could finish telling me about the different kinds of sand.
UNK: I'd love to. Wait right here, I'll go get the projector and my notes.
UNK: Thanks. You're such a good friend.
Rachel : Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her.
UNK: -No. -Is Ross home?
UNK: Maybe I'll call him and see if he's seen her..
