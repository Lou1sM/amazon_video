UNK: Oh, no, I know how to handle it.
UNK: -Good. -Yeah.
UNK: Trying to figure out how you know me?
UNK: I'll give you a hint. From porn!
Phoebe : Yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!
UNK: -See? -Yeah.
UNK: Hey.
Ross : You may have been right about Jill.
Rachel : I knew it! What happened?
Ross : She kissed me.
Rachel : What? You kissed?
Chandler : Maybe we should give them some privacy...
UNK: Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
UNK: Doesn't sound like it. It's easy not to kiss someone.
UNK: You just don't. Look at us right now, not kissing!
Ross : Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me...
UNK: and I didn't stop it.
UNK: I guess I just wasn't thinking.
UNK: Yeah. Let me give you something to think about.
UNK: Hold on! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Rachel : Thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth to tell me that.
UNK: I realized if anything happened with me and Jill...
Ross : then nothing could ever happen with us.
UNK: -What? -No, I mean...
UNK: I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us...
Ross : again, ever.
UNK: But I don't want to know that it never could.
Ross : So I stopped it...
Ross : and she got mad and broke my projector.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: I don't even know what to say.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: You're welcome.
UNK: My God, are you crying?
UNK: I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
UNK: All right, I'm leaving.
UNK: I'm not spending one more day with someone who's out to sabotage me.
UNK: That's you, Rachel.
Rachel : Yeah, I got that.
Jill : And you! I throw myself at you...
Jill : and you say no? How gay are you?
Ross : You take care, Jill.
UNK: Okay, I'm leaving. Don't worry about me, I'll make it on my own.
UNK: Who knows how I'll get by, or even if I'll survive.
UNK: You can stop that now, I know you made up with Daddy.
UNK: -You do? How? -Oh, just a wild guess...
UNK: and your limo just pulled up.
UNK: -Sorry I didn't get to know you guys better. -Absolute shame.
UNK: -Okay, see you. -Bye-bye.
UNK: I can't believe Jill's gone.
UNK: I can't help it, I opened a gate!
