Rachel : This is not about me being jealous.
UNK: It's about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.
UNK: Can't have?
Jill : Excuse me. The only thing I can't have is dairy!
Rachel : Well, you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
UNK: -Who? -With Human Resources!
UNK: Jealous of her? Who does she think she is, Princess Caroline?
UNK: -You're jealous of Princess Caroline? -Do I have my own castle?
UNK: Hey.
UNK: -Phoebe's not here, is she? -No.
Monica : Did you get a movie?
Phoebe : Yeah. Yeah.
UNK: But I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
UNK: Not more movies that'll have us reaching for the tissues all night?
Joey : Sort of.
UNK: What's going on?
UNK: Phoebe's a porn star!
UNK: -What? -Yeah!
UNK: What are you talking about?
UNK: "Phoebe Buffay in Buffay The Vampire Layer."
UNK: That's Phoebe. Where did you get that?
UNK: At the adult video place on Bleecker.
UNK: And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him...
Ross : to surprise him.
UNK: Then I pretended that I didn't know he was in there.
Rachel : Wow. I mean, I just can't believe this.
Rachel : I mean, you think you know someone.
UNK: Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
Monica : This is so bizarre.
UNK: I guess it makes sense. She had such a terrible childhood.
UNK: I had a bad childhood and I don't do porn.
Monica : Yes, but you're dead inside.
UNK: I'd better take that back.
UNK: What, why? Why?
UNK: We can't watch it. It's Phoebe.
UNK: We shouldn't watch this.
UNK: Absolutely not. That goes back.
UNK: -Maybe a bit. -The first half?
Joey : This is wrong, you guys! Phoebe's our friend!
UNK: -I'm not gonna watch it. -Yeah!
Ross : Good for you, Joe.
UNK: I thought I'd find you here, Nosferatool.
UNK: The Vampire : Are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
UNK: Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.
UNK: What's that on her ankle?
UNK: Her ankle is what you're watching?
UNK: Well, it's hard to tell.
Rachel : God, if she would just stop moving.
UNK: She's just doing her job.
Joey : You sick bastards!
UNK: It's a tattoo.
UNK: That's weird. Phoebe doesn't..
UNK: Wait, that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!
UNK: Wait, wait! I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
UNK: Hey.
UNK: What's up? Oh, my God! What am I doing?!
