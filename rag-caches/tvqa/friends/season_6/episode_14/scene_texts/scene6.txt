UNK: Alcohol.
UNK: There's wine in the kitchen.
Monica : Oh, great.
Rachel : What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut?
UNK: Okay. Rach, calm down, okay?
UNK: She's really upset. We're just talking.
UNK: She's making something happen with you to get back at me.
UNK: That's the only reason she could be here, huh?
UNK: It couldn't be that maybe I'm a good listener...
UNK: and I put on a great slide show?
Rachel : Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.
Ross : I think I can take care of myself. I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.
Ross : That was your sister, actually.
UNK: She thinks you're just using me.
UNK: So?
UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
Phoebe : I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Joey : Oh, no, not you too?
UNK: I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks. There were a lot of them.
UNK: Nice!
UNK: And I won't have to go back there anymore...
Phoebe : because I gave them my "correct address."
UNK: Isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star?
