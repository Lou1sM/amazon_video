UNK: That story doesn't make you cry?
UNK: No. Look, I don't cry. It's not a big deal, okay?
UNK: No! It's not okay!
UNK: It's not okay at all!
Monica : You're dead inside!
UNK: The Fan : -Excuse me? -Yeah?
UNK: The Fan : -Are you Phoebe Buffay? -Yeah.
UNK: The Fan : Can I get your autograph? I'm your biggest fan.
Phoebe : My biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you.
Phoebe : Sure. Yeah.
UNK: The Fan : Wow. Wow, thanks a lot.
UNK: I just want to say, I think you're really talented.
UNK: You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan.
Phoebe : Take good care of that guy. He's a fan.
UNK: Bye.
Joey : So you saw me on Days of Our Lives, huh?
UNK: You want me to do a little Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?
UNK: The Fan : I have no idea what you're talking about.
UNK: But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.
UNK: Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.
UNK: Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.
UNK: -Movies? -That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
UNK: I don't think so.
UNK: The Fan : No, it was. She was in Sex Toy Story Two...
UNK: Lawrence of a Labia.
UNK: The Fan : And I got her autograph.
UNK: The Fan : The guys at the comic book store won't believe this.
UNK: Gunther?
UNK: Don't let that guy in here anymore. He said Phoebe's a porn star.
UNK: Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good.
Gunther : You should check out Inspect Her Gadget.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey.
Jill : Ross just totally blew me off, and he didn't even tell me why.
Rachel : Oh, well.
Rachel : The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.
Rachel : Oh! There is this great guy you will just love at work, named Bob.
UNK: He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
UNK: Maybe I talk too much, or maybe I should have been more aggressive sexually.
Ross : No, no, no.
UNK: No, that would never have worked on Ross.
UNK: But you know who that might work on? Bob in Human Resources.
UNK: Thanks, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
UNK: Not random. Bob.
UNK: It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough...
UNK: Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.
UNK: No, that can't be it. It's gotta be the smart thing.
UNK: I'm so stupid. I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl.
Rachel : No, honey.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay. You want to know why Ross canceled the date?
Rachel : Because I asked him to.
Jill : You asked him to?
UNK: -Why? -Because you are my sister...
Rachel : and Ross and I have this huge history.
Jill : -You want to go out with Ross? -No.
UNK: You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
UNK: You know, Bob in Human Resources...
UNK: I can't believe you did this! You had me doubting how smart I was!
Jill : You had me doubting my fashion sense!
UNK: It's not that big a deal. Just don't date Ross. There's other..
Jill : You have no right to tell me what to do.
UNK: I'm not telling you what to do. I am telling you what not to do!
Jill : Why are you so jealous of me?
