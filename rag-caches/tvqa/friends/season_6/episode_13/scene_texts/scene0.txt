UNK: Okay, Rach, that's muffin and espresso, $4.50.
Joey : Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.
UNK: And Phoebe, herbal tea, $1.25.
UNK: All together that's $12.75.
UNK: This coming from the man who couldn't split our $80 phone bill in half.
Woman : How much do I owe you?
UNK: That's on the house, courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Woman : Great. Well, tell him thanks.
Woman : And since Joey seems like such a nice guy...
UNK: maybe we could go out?
UNK: He's not used to women being so forward...
UNK: but I could check with him. He says it's okay.
Joey : Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.
UNK: How come our stuff isn't free?
Joey : It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt.
UNK: I'm getting more dates than ever.
UNK: You're only giving free stuff to the pretty girls?
Phoebe : Joey, that is so gross!
Joey : How about a scone on the house, baby?
UNK: I'm pretty.
UNK: The One With Rachel's Sister
UNK: Oh, you know what?
UNK: No.
Phoebe : Wait a second.
UNK: -I know it's in here. -You know what? I'm good.
UNK: Sorry, I guess it's in my big bag.
UNK: Say, does anybody have a goldfish?
UNK: Why are you here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Monica : They sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
UNK: -Sorry you're sick. -I'm not sick!
UNK: I don't get sick. Getting sick is for weaklings, it's for pansies.
UNK: No one thinks that you're a pansy...
Rachel : but we do think that you need a tissue.
Monica : I have not been sick in over three years.
UNK: I think you're sick because that used to be in your nose.
UNK: I'll get tissue.
UNK: I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.
UNK: When you put a D at the end of fine...
UNK: you're not fine.
UNK: I'm fine-d.
UNK: I'm fine-d.
UNK: It's a really hard word to say.
UNK: -Yes? -Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Rachel : Oh, my God, Jill!
Jill : Oh, my God, Rachel!
Chandler : Oh, my God, introduce us.
Rachel : This is Chandler. And you know Monica and Ross.
UNK: And that's Phoebe. And that's Joey.
UNK: -How you doing? -Don't!
