UNK: So you want to go...
Chandler : mix it up?
UNK: -Not now, I'm sick. -Oh, come on, you big faker!
UNK: What about never sleeping with sick people?
Chandler : Well, that was before all the vaporizing action.
Monica : Okay, if you really want to have sex.
Monica : Worked like a charm.
UNK: Why are you here?
Jill : This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
UNK: I don't like it.
UNK: -Really? -It's kind of slutty.
UNK: It's yours.
UNK: Yeah, well, I'm a slut.
Jill : Me too.
Ross : Hi, Jill.
UNK: Hi...
UNK: Rachel.
UNK: You're not at home, you're right here.
Rachel : Yeah, I know.
Rachel : And I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: So, well, I'll...
UNK: I'll have her home by midnight.
UNK: Why aren't you home yet?
Monica : Is someone there?
UNK: Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.
Chandler : What are you doing here?
UNK: I'm just looking out your window...
Rachel : at the view.
Rachel : What are you guys doing?
UNK: We got some vapor rub in some places.
Rachel : He brought her back to his apartment.
UNK: Who?
Monica : Is that your sister?
Rachel : She is a slut!
Monica : Ross is on a date with your sister. How weird is that?
UNK: Oh, my God, he's taking off her clothes!
UNK: He's taking off her coat.
Rachel : Oh, this is just terrible.
UNK: Oh, no, it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
UNK: He's gonna get some.
Chandler : Of the glare...
Chandler : from the streetlight out of his apartment.
UNK: You know, so he's closed the drapes there...
Chandler : so he can have a nice, pleasant...
Chandler : conversation with your little sister.
UNK: Well, I'm off to bed.
UNK: I don't feel good.
UNK: You better not get me sick.
UNK: I need some fruit or some juice or some....
UNK: Or some nothing.
UNK: There's nothing in here. Who took our food?
UNK: Can I interest you in a slice of lasagna or a drumstick?
UNK: -No, thanks. -Are you sure? It's on the house.
UNK: -No, thanks. -How about going out with me Friday night?
UNK: -No, thanks. -What are you gonna do.
