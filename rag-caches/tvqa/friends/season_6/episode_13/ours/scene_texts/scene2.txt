UNK: So, what'd you get?
UNK: Oh, well, all right. Thank you.
UNK: I got this, you know, "I want a job" sweater.
Phoebe : And then I got.. These are apartment pants.
Phoebe : Apartment pants?
UNK: You've never heard of them?
UNK: Of course I've heard of them.
UNK: Ross, what'd you get?
Phoebe : I got this...
UNK: This.
UNK: -A pashmina? -Yeah!
UNK: I love these babies.
UNK: Really?
UNK: What's a pashmina?
UNK: It's a rug.
UNK: Jill?
UNK: I'm sorry, Rachel.
UNK: You think that's gonna work on me? I invented that.
Jill : Right! But I am sorry.
UNK: It's okay. One little setback is okay.
UNK: -But don't let it happen again, okay? -Okay.
Rachel : Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.
UNK: But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
Rachel : And the pants.
UNK: I'll take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.
UNK: Alrighty.
UNK: I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
Jill : She took all my stuff.
Ross : Yeah. Everything but the little blue one.
UNK: That's the best one!
UNK: Oh, my God. Thank you so much!
Ross : Well, hey.
Jill : Oh, my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pashmina could be a rug.
Ross : Oh, yeah? How about you with the "I'm sorry"?
UNK: Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.
UNK: What about what I said about the apartment pants? How dumb was l?
Jill : -Were you this cute in high school? -Oh, stop.
Jill : -No, you stop. -No, you stop.
UNK: Why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it?
UNK: Okay. So, what do you want to do?
UNK: Let's do something crazy.
UNK: I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
UNK: Okay, I'll rest.
UNK: But if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
UNK: See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all...
Chandler : drippy here.
UNK: Are you saying that you don't want to get with this?
UNK: I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.
Rachel : Come on.
UNK: Don't take this personally.
UNK: I just can't have sex with a sick person.
UNK: I'm with you. I can't have sex with a sick person either. Disgusting!
UNK: But I'm not sick!
Monica : Let me prove it to you.
Monica : We are two healthy people in the prime of lime.
