UNK: I think there's something you should know.
Rachel : Better not be about the apartment pants.
Rachel : I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
UNK: No. It's just, I was...
Phoebe : I was with Ross and Jill after you left...
UNK: and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
UNK: -What? -I mean, it's probably nothing.
UNK: But I wanted to warn you that there might be something.
Phoebe : -With Ross and Jill? -Yeah.
Rachel : With Ross and my sister?
Rachel : With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Rachel : -Oh, there is no way. -Okay, then.
UNK: Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!
UNK: I don't like it when he dates anyone, but my sister?
UNK: Isn't that incest or something?
UNK: And they're gonna have sex.
Rachel : Oh, no! What if he marries her too?
Rachel : This is just terrible. This is just terrible.
UNK: And I can't stop it. I don't own Ross.
UNK: And Jill should be able to do what she wants to do.
UNK: Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister.
UNK: This is the worst thing that could've ever happened to me.
Phoebe : But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
UNK: That'll be $3.85.
UNK: What? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay.
UNK: It's just, I can't, because my manager said that I..
Joey : Happy birthday to you
Joey : Happy birthday to you
Joey : -Happy birthday, dear Annie.. -Amy!
UNK: Amy
Joey : Happy birthday to you
UNK: That's weird, today's my birthday too.
UNK: Not in here, it isn't.
UNK: Sorry I'm late. What's up?
Rachel : I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
UNK: No. But I walked past three sales and didn't go in.
Jill : How strong am I?
Rachel : That is great.
UNK: You know who doesn't have to job-hunt? Ross.
Rachel : -He works at the university. -Yeah?
UNK: So you guys talked? So you get along? So you're gonna go out?
Jill : Me go out with Ross? No.
Jill : God, no. What would make you think that?
UNK: Phoebe...
UNK: said she thought she saw something between you guys.
UNK: I mean, he's nice.
UNK: He's the kind you're friends with, but not the kind you date.
UNK: He's the kind you date, because you did. But me?
Jill : Not so much.
UNK: Oh, not so much. What do you mean? Is there something wrong with Ross?
UNK: No, no, no. He's just...
UNK: I don't know. You know, he's just a little bookish.
UNK: Are you saying he's a geek?
Jill : You think so too?
Rachel : No. Ross is not a geek.
UNK: Then let's just say he's not my type.
Rachel : Handsome is not your type?
Rachel : Smart, kind, good kisser.
UNK: What, those things aren't on your list?
UNK: Ross is great. You'd be lucky to be with him.
Jill : If it means that much, then I'll ask him out.
UNK: Oh, no. That's not what I meant.
UNK: You know what? You're right.
Jill : He has been really nice to me.
UNK: Yeah, but he's not your type.
UNK: But maybe that's good.
UNK: I'm doing all these different things.
UNK: Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.
UNK: Yeah, but you don't want to try too much too fast.
UNK: You remember what happened to the little girl who...
UNK: tried too much too fast, don't you?
UNK: What?
Rachel : She died, Jill.
UNK: Chandler!
Chandler : What is it, honey? You need some tea? Some soup?
