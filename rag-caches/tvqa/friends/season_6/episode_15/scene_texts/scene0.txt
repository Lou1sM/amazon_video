UNK: So it seems like this Internet thing is here to stay, huh?
UNK: It's okay not to talk.
Rachel : Hey, you guys, guess what.
Rachel : -Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce. -Oh, my God.
Joey : What is the matter with you?
Phoebe : No. Barry and Mindy.
UNK: Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce," I immediately go to Ross.
UNK: Who's Barry and Mindy?
UNK: Barry was the guy that I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend.
UNK: Wasn't he cheating on you with her?
UNK: But that just means he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Monica : -Why did they get divorced? -Well, apparently...
Rachel : she caught him cheating on her with someone else.
UNK: Isn't that sad?
UNK: Can you imagine if I'd married him? How different would my life be?
UNK: I've always wondered how different my life would be...
UNK: if I'd never gotten divorced.
Phoebe : -Which time? -The first time!
UNK: Imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
UNK: I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
UNK: I bet I'd still be doing my karate.
UNK: Towards the end of our marriage, I did a lot of karate to release the tension...
UNK: from not doing anything else physical.
Chandler : Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."
Monica : What if I was still fat?
UNK: You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Chandler : -Sure I would. -Come on.
UNK: You guys really think I'm that shallow?
Ross : No, I just think Monica was that fat.
UNK: Hey, imagine if I'd never got fired off Days of Our Lives.
UNK: Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.
Chandler : What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
UNK: I'd probably be writing for The New Yorker, being paid to be funny.
UNK: But my job's fun too. I mean, tomorrow...
UNK: I don't have to wear a tie.
UNK: What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
UNK: -What? -Merrill Lynch?
Phoebe : I had a massage client who worked there, and he said I had a knack for stocks.
UNK: Why didn't you take the job?
UNK: Because at that time, I thought that everything that rhymed was true.
UNK: I thought if I worked with stocks...
UNK: I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
UNK: Yeah, you don't want that in a broker.
UNK: Do you guys think if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Ross : Oh, my God. Rachel Green?
UNK: Rob Tilman!
UNK: No, no, it's me. Ross.
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tilman.
UNK: -No. No, no. Ross Geller. -Of course! Monica's brother.
All : -Yeah. Right. -Wow! How are you?
UNK: Good. Good. I'm married.
Rachel : Me too!
UNK: -Isn't it the best? -Oh, it's the best.
UNK: -So how's Monica? -Really, really great.
UNK: Actually, she's right down the street. You should stop by and say hi.
