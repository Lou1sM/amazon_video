Monica : Wait a minute.
UNK: My last Kit Kat bar.
UNK: -You want to share it? -Okay!
UNK: Chandler, I know you're mad. I'm sorry.
Joey : I was a total jerk. Completely over the line.
Joey : I just... I hate pulp.
UNK: You know how Monica feels about low-fat mayonnaise?
UNK: It's not mayonnaise!
Joey : Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and here.
UNK: -What's this? -Fresh-squeezed orange juice, with pulp.
Joey : -Just the way you like it. -Thanks, man.
Monica : Hey, Joey.
Monica : Joey? Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics.
UNK: That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?
UNK: You wouldn't care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Joey : Are you kidding me? I love Archie and the whole gang.
Chandler : Well, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy.
UNK: But he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money.
Chandler : So Reggie hires him as his assist..
Chandler : As his butler.
UNK: And then makes him do crazy things...
UNK: Like bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps in them.
Monica : Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar.
Joey : Did they already do that one? I think I read it!
UNK: Monica, listen. I have to ask.
Rachel : Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment.
Rachel : -Does he do this with a lot of girls? -Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.
UNK: And I'm one of them.
Rachel : I just cannot believe this. I mean, Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: You don't have to use his last name.
UNK: But, Monica, come on, it's Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: I guess you have to.
UNK: It's none of my business, but aren't you married?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I wish we could just not be married for a little bit.
UNK: You know, I just wish we could be, like, on a break.
UNK: Well, you're not.
UNK: It's easy for you. You're not married. You can have sex with whoever you want.
Monica : Yeah, I can.
UNK: Don't think I don't. I do.
Monica : I mean, all the time. You bet!
UNK: Monica?
UNK: You've done it, right?
Monica : Of course I have. What do you think, I'm, like, some 30-year-old virgin?
Monica : Oh, my God. You're a 30-year-old virgin.
UNK: Say it louder. The guy in the back didn't hear you.
UNK: Yeah, I heard it.
UNK: It's not like I haven't had the opportunity.
UNK: I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
UNK: I'm seeing this guy Roger. He's not perfect...
UNK: but I'm thinking maybe I should get it over with.
UNK: You know, give him my flower.
Rachel : Oh, my God, do it! Honey, you've waited long enough.
UNK: -You know what? You are right. -Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.
UNK: There shouldn't be all these rules and restrictions.
Rachel : People should be able to sleep with whoever they want, whenever..
UNK: Rachel, I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband.
Rachel : What do you know, virgin?
UNK: Phoebe?
Monica : Why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?
