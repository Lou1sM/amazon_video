UNK: They didn't add the second 'cous' until 1979."
UNK: Stop it! That's not funny!
UNK: I'm sorry, okay? It's just...
Monica : tonight was supposed to be a big deal.
Chandler : -What was tonight? -You don't want to know.
Chandler : What was tonight?
UNK: Tonight was going to be my first time.
Chandler : With Roger?
Chandler : Not just with Roger?
Monica : Oh, my God.
Monica : All right, relax, Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!
Chandler : Four different women!
UNK: I've had sex way more times.
Monica : -How many? -Nine.
UNK: I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
Chandler : Good for you. You really think that Roger's the perfect guy?
UNK: No, but he's not a horrible guy.
UNK: That's what I tell girls about me.
UNK: Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
Chandler : No, you are not. You are sweet and wonderful...
Chandler : and this is gonna happen for you.
Monica : Oh, really? When? Do you want to do it with me?
UNK: Okay.
Monica : I was kidding.
Chandler : So was I.
UNK: You're such an amazing actor.
Rachel : How do you know where Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...
Rachel : and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Joey : Well, with Dr. Drake...
Joey : they always tell me what to say.
Joey : And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Rachel : Tell me something, Joey.
Rachel : -I just fell right off the couch there. -Yeah, you did.
Ross : Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Joey : When was the last time...
Joey : someone told you just how beautiful you are?
UNK: Wow.
UNK: I can't feel my hands.
UNK: Come on. Come here.
UNK: We can't do this.
UNK: Oyster?
Chandler : If we did do this, there'd be a lot of pressure on me.
UNK: Because you've waited a long time, and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
UNK: But I have nothing to compare it to.
UNK: Even if you were horrible, how would I know?
Chandler : I do like that.
UNK: It's harder for me. I have four women to compete with.
Chandler : Well, if it helps, there were only three.
Chandler : So it'd just be for tonight, right?
Monica : Absolutely. It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
UNK: Stop it. We're not doing this.
UNK: -Let's do it! -No!
UNK: Okay!
UNK: Do you have any moves?
Chandler : I have some moves.
Monica : I have no moves.
UNK: Okay, what you doing there?
UNK: -I'm sorry, this is just too weird. -Yeah, forget it.
Monica : What if I turn out the lights?
