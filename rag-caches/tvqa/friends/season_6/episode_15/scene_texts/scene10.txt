UNK: That's the couch.
Ross : I know.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Ross : I know!
UNK: I'll tell you something.
Monica : We are gonna do that again!
UNK: Morning.
Joey : Oh, right.
Rachel : Oh, God.
UNK: Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up.
Joey : He actually saw you a little bit too.
UNK: Oh, God, we didn't...?
Joey : Not after seeing that.
UNK: God, I'm just a horrible person.
UNK: -Wh..? Why? -Because I'm married.
UNK: That's right, I'm a married woman.
UNK: I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair.
UNK: That's ridiculous.
UNK: I'm not a "star."
UNK: I'm just a regular famous actor.
UNK: And I'm a horrible, horrible person.
UNK: Rachel, will you stop saying that?
Joey : Hey, look.
Joey : Remember on the show when Capri was dying?
Joey : -And she gave me.. -The ring from the cave.
Monica : Oh, my God! They let you keep that stuff?
UNK: Sure. As long as they don't find out, you can keep whatever you want.
Joey : And I want you to have it.
UNK: No, I couldn't.
Joey : Every time you look at it...
Joey : I want you to remember that you are a good person.
UNK: Now, you had the chance to cheat...
Joey : and with me.
UNK: But you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
Rachel : But I thought that ring stood for Capri's undying love for her brother.
UNK: Look, you want the ring or not?
UNK: Hey, look at you! You're up!
UNK: I thought I'd try to take a walk.
UNK: Will you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
UNK: You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are you?
UNK: No. I've learned my lesson.
UNK: Let's go! Come on! Move it!
UNK: Phoebe, come on!
UNK: Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou. Good luck with the gallbladder.
Monica : Hey, Joe...
Ross : did you ever have a threesome?
UNK: Look, Ross, I think Carol's great, and I'm sure you're very attractive, but...
UNK: No. The reason I'm asking is that...
UNK: I sort of had one last night.
UNK: You?
Joey : All right. So? Was it amazing?
Carol : It was...
UNK: okay.
UNK: Just okay? Did you do it right?
UNK: Look, it's just, did you ever go to a party and think :
UNK: "Would anyone really miss me if I weren't here?"
Joey : But still, Ross...
UNK: your worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day.
UNK: It's just...
Ross : my part seemed to be over pretty quickly...
Ross : and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Joey : But you got to be with both of them.
Ross : Not really.
Ross : Just Carol.
Joey : -Not the other one? -No, she kept kicking me away.
UNK: You don't want that.
Joey : At least you got to see a lot of stuff.
UNK: Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.
UNK: -You get a little bored? -A little.
Ross : Made a snack.
UNK: -What'd you have? -Just a sandwich.
Ross : Turkey. A little mustard.
Joey : -Sounds good. -It really was.
Chandler : Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night.
Chandler : Wait a minute, that was you.
UNK: Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!
Chandler : So you want to do something tonight?
UNK: I can't. Dr. Roger's coming over again.
Joey : Oh, right.
UNK: Because you're still seeing him, and he's a good guy.
