Ross : Right. No problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Phoebe : Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?
UNK: No, just relax. Nobody yelled.
UNK: Jack was making sure you were getting better.
Phoebe : Thank God.
UNK: Yeah, she's fired.
UNK: You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.
UNK: You've got to let her go.
UNK: Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.
UNK: Dr. Drake Remoray : Not so fast, Wesley.
UNK: Ramoray!
UNK: That's right, Wesley.
UNK: Dr. Drake Remoray : I just stopped by to say that you're not a real doctor.
UNK: And that woman's brain is fine.
Rachel : Oh, thank God.
UNK: Dr. Drake Remoray : -Hope? Hope? -Drake.
UNK: You're not dying, Hope.
UNK: You're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Hope : Oh, Drake.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Monica's Boyfriend : Here we go.
UNK: Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.
Rachel : I am free tomorrow night.
Rachel : Yeah, sure, sure, I can bring some sandwiches.
Ross : So, honey...
Ross : this threesome thing?
UNK: How are we even gonna start to find..?
UNK: Actually, I'm making a list of women I know who might be into this.
UNK: Boy.
UNK: Someone's been doing their homework.
Carol : I know Gail Rosten is in there twice...
Carol : but she is so...
Ross : Oh, I know.
UNK: You know, just talking about it is getting me kind of...
UNK: I know. Me too.
UNK: I think Ben's asleep.
UNK: You know, I think it'll be better if we just save it.
Ross : Right. Save it. I can do that.
UNK: Why do you always wear that dumb hat?
UNK: What, you late for your paper route?
UNK: "Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Jones. Here's your paper.
UNK: I'm sorry about your window."
Monica : Hey, Phoebe.
UNK: How's it going?

Monica : Here you go, sweetie.
Phoebe : What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea.
UNK: Well, I put some honey in it.
UNK: -She doesn't know she was fired? -No, the doctors say it may kill her.
UNK: What are you girls whispering about over there?
Chandler : But I think we should tell her.
UNK: Look, Phoebe, maybe this whole heart-attack thing is a sign...
UNK: that you should start thinking about getting a different job.
Phoebe : Okay, what is this, a stupid contest?
UNK: Because we've got a winner here.
UNK: He's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
