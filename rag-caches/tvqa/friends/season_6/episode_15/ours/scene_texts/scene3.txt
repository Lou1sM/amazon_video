UNK: Who's this?
UNK: You're gonna like working for me.
UNK: What's your name? What kind of name is "Brindy"?
Phoebe : Stop talking.
Phoebe : All right, from now on your name is Joan.
Phoebe : You can pick your own last name.
UNK: I can't find my pen. Did you eat that too?
Joey : -There you are. -Uh-oh, it's my boss.
UNK: Here's a list of things for you to do today.
UNK: This is gonna be so great. Thank you so much.

Joey : No, no! No!
UNK: Wait! You didn't sit on my Kit Kats did you?
UNK: No, there was a little, little dip in the market...
Phoebe : and I lost 13 million dollars.
UNK: But the Kit Kats are all right?
UNK: What am I gonna do? I can't call my office, they'll kill me.
UNK: I can't call my clients, they'll kill themselves!
UNK: -Great, now my chest hurts. -What?
Phoebe : My chest hurts.
UNK: -And now I can't breathe. -Are you having a heart attack?
UNK: If I were, would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
UNK: -Yes. -Then, yes. That is what I'm having.
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: Okay, this thing is useless. So will you dial 911 for me?
