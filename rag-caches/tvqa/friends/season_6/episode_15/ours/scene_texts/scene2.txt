UNK: Okay, let's go see Monica.
Joey : So, Monica. Still going out with Dr. Boring, huh?
UNK: He's not boring. He's just...
UNK: He's low-key.
UNK: -Here you go, one hazelnut latte. -Thank you.
UNK: You know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.
UNK: It's a seed.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: Can anyone else name a well-known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Joey : Oh, dear God. Let me think.
UNK: What's the matter?
UNK: I got another rejection letter.
Chandler : They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic" funny.
UNK: I gotta get back to the hospital.
UNK: -Bye. -Bye-bye.
UNK: By the way, the answer is : the Brazil nut.
Chandler : Was his question, "What's more boring than him?"
UNK: And nice sweater vest, by the way.
UNK: -Stop it, guys. He's sweet. -Yeah, yeah.
Joey : Hey, man. Sorry about the Archie thing.
Joey : You need me to give you some money?
Chandler : I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Joey doesn't have to give you the money.
Monica : -TV stars have assistants, right? -That's an idea.
UNK: If I hire an assistant, would you take money from her?
Monica : No, Joey. Chandler could be your assistant.
Monica : He could answer all your fan mail and stuff.
UNK: -That would be great! Let's do that! -I could use the money.
UNK: I'd have time to write.
Joey : -Great. Welcome aboard! -Okay!
UNK: All right. Now, I need to use the bathroom.
UNK: Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
Joey : All right.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey, Phoebe.
UNK: Guess what. Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant.
UNK: That's so sweet.
Phoebe : Oh! Hang on!
Phoebe : Hang on!
UNK: Go!
Joey : No. No, no. I said sell when it hits 50!
UNK: Five-oh! It's a number! It comes after four-nine!
UNK: No, it's okay. It's okay. You're allowed one mistake.
Phoebe : Just kidding. You are, of course, fired.
UNK: Oh, what a shame. I really liked her.
Ross : Hey, Mon? Mon, look who I ran into!
Ross : Oh, my God, Rachel!
UNK: -God, you look terrific! -So do you!
Rachel : -Did you lose weight? -You are so sweet to notice.
UNK: Yes, I lost 3.5 pounds!
Ross : You remember my friend Chandler.
UNK: -And that's Phoebe over there. -Hi.
UNK: Sit down. How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Ross : 1987, the day after Christmas. Sean McMahan's party.
UNK: I played you one of my songs, you know, "Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."
Rachel : Oh, yeah. Right.
UNK: -So, now, do you still do music? -Well, sometimes.
UNK: -Come over sometime. I'll play you.. -Oh, my God!
