UNK: What's going on with you?
UNK: Well, I've been doing a lot more of my karate.
UNK: -Still a dry spell with Carol? -Yeah.
Phoebe : How long has it been since you've had sex?
Ross : -Well, last weekend... -Oh, that's not so bad.
Ross : will be two months...
Ross : since I stopped trying.
Phoebe : You need to spice things up.
Ross : -What do you mean? -I don't know.
Phoebe : You could tie her up. You could eat stuff off each other.
UNK: Dirty talk, menage a trois, toys.
UNK: Role-playing. You're the warden, she's the prisoner.
UNK: -You're the pirate, she's the wench. -Okay, I think I got it.
UNK: Or you could be two stockbrokers, and you're rolling naked on the trading floor...
UNK: and everybody's watching.
Phoebe : It never happened.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: -So how is it going with Joey? -Just great. He beeps me now with codes.
UNK: One is : "Bring me food."
UNK: Two is : "I'm with a girl. Bring us food."
UNK: Three is : "I'm lost and I can't find food."
UNK: Oh, sweetie.
UNK: Is there any food around here?
Joey : -Is she gonna be all right? -Yeah, she's in there.
Joey : Oh, great.
Joey : Go take off those pants. They look ready.
UNK: And over there is Brady's Pub...
Joey : where I like to unwind after a long day of "surgeoning."
Rachel : This is so amazing. What else?
Joey : Well, that is a large piece of television equipment.
Joey : And that is an old man.
Joey : -Hey, old man! -Hey.
UNK: Alrighty. What do you say we head back to my place?
UNK: You know, I would really love to, but I shouldn't.
UNK: Why? Why can't the world stop turning...
Joey : just for a moment, just for us?
UNK: Isn't that a line from the show?
Rachel : Yeah, but...
Joey : I may have said those things before, but...
Joey : I never truly meant them until now.
UNK: That's a line from the show too!
Joey : Okay, you watch too much TV.
UNK: Here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: There's pulp in that.
Joey : I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp.
UNK: No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice.
UNK: I'm sorry. I guess I just like the pulp.
UNK: I'm sorry. I am being so rude.
UNK: Rachel, would you like a soda or something?
UNK: Because Chandler will run right out and get it.
UNK: Yeah, well, sure, iced tea would be great.
Rachel : Iced tea.
Chandler : Okay. Anything for you, sir?
Joey : Did I not just tell him?
Joey : Okay, look, Chandler, if this is gonna work...
Joey : you have got to listen.
UNK: You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't you?
UNK: It's not all juice.
Ross : So, honey, this morning was fun, huh?
Ross : Me hopping in on you in the shower there?
UNK: Yeah, maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
UNK: Look, Carol, I was thinking maybe...
Ross : Maybe we can spice things up a little.
Ross : -What do you mean? -Carol, our sex life. It's just not..
UNK: -Dad! -Hey there, little fella!
UNK: Why don't we get some shoes on you, huh?
UNK: Why don't you show Dad how you can put your shoes on in your room.
Ross : Seriously, our sex life.
UNK: I was thinking maybe, I don't know...
UNK: we could try some new things, you know, for fun.
Carol : -Like what? -Well, I don't know.
Ross : What if we were to...
Ross : tie each other up?
Ross : Some people eat stuff off one another.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: You know, we could try dirty talk.
Ross : -We could have a threesome. -I love that idea!
Chandler : Who sold a story to Archie Comics?
UNK: Oh, my God, that's so great.
UNK: You're a published writer. I wish I had a present for you.
