Chandler : I remember a time...
Monica : Are you okay?
Chandler : Yeah, totally.
UNK: Totally. Are you?
UNK: Great. It's so amazing.
Monica : Last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous.
UNK: But after being with you, I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
Chandler : I bet he can.
UNK: "I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical."
UNK: -You sure you're okay? -Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
Rachel : My God! Barry!
UNK: You said you were going to be away all weekend!
UNK: That's right! I'm sorry! I am early!
Rachel : Finish, please!
UNK: Surprise! Look who's back!
UNK: Call security.
UNK: Phoebe, didn't you get fired?
UNK: I don't think so.
Jack : -What are you doing here? -All better. Back to work.
Phoebe : This clown from research told me I was fired.
Phoebe : He should do his research, huh?
Jack : Well, you were fired.
Jack : I told that guy who answered your phone.
UNK: I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count.
UNK: Anyway, I'll be in my office.
UNK: Phoebe, you don't have an office.
UNK: I'll work right here.
UNK: This is good. Next to this plant.
UNK: You're in my office.
UNK: I've made a lot of cash for this company. I am talking big bucks!
Phoebe : Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake..
Jack : You lost 13 million dollars.
UNK: So now this is all about money?
UNK: You know, it's bad enough that...
Phoebe : You have got to be kidding.
Jack : -Are you all right? -I'm having another heart attack.
UNK: I'm having another heart attack!
Phoebe : Call 911!
UNK: Dumb-ass!
UNK: Phoebe, how's it going?
UNK: They fired me, and I'm having a heart attack.
Woman : Well, welcome back.
Rachel : Is Joey Tribbiani here?
UNK: If you see him, please tell him I'm looking for him...
UNK: and that this time I am not gonna throw up!
UNK: Well, that's always good news.
