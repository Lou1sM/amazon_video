UNK: Is that the kind of guy you wanna take to a ball?
Phoebe : "Hey, Sebastian, would you like to dance?"
UNK: "Okay. I gotta go."
Monica : Stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry.
Monica : That is a very insensitive thing to do.
Monica : Let us make it up to you. We have two really great guys for you.
Phoebe : Yeah, what have you got to lose?
Phoebe : You might even end up with someone really special. If you pick my guy.
Joey : -All right. -So you will meet our guys?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: It doesn't matter which one you choose. It's up to you.
Chandler : Our guy is perfect.
UNK: Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough for herself.
Joey : There you are! You broke my fridge.
UNK: You owe me $400.
Phoebe : -Okay, sure. -Really?
Phoebe : Technically, you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts...
UNK: on your last 10 auditions.
Joey : Call it even?
UNK: Okay.
Joey : There you are.
Chandler : What did Elizabeth say?
UNK: Turns out she is going to Daytona for "spring break, wahoo."
Ross : That means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...
UNK: waking up with strangers.
UNK: She is gonna have a great time!
Joey : Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Chandler : -You know the hotels? -I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo!
Monica : In 1981, you were 13.
UNK: So? I drove down, sold T-shirts. Had a blast.
UNK: You know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
UNK: Okay, she can't go.
UNK: You can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Ross : -What am I supposed to do? -You just have to be cool with it.
UNK: What if she goes down there and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
UNK: Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
UNK: I'm sorry, this is very serious. And you know what, Ross?
UNK: You like her, she likes you, everything's gonna be fine.
UNK: You're right. I'm probably overreacting.
UNK: It's just she's staying at this party hotel on the beach...
UNK: with a huge pool and free drinks with every meal.
UNK: If she's got enough money for that, she can certainly pat for the fridge she broke.
UNK: I'm so glad you're going on this trip.
UNK: I've been working so hard this semester.
Elizabeth : I really need to go crazy, blow off some steam.
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Look, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but...
UNK: I know a great way to blow off steam.
UNK: -What? -Are you into crafts at all?
Elizabeth : Ross, are you okay?
UNK: Yeah. Of course I'm okay.
UNK: I'm just being supportive.
Ross : Supportive of you and this whole trip...
UNK: and what's this?
UNK: It's a bathing suit?
Ross : To wear in front of people?
Elizabeth : Is that supportive?
Chandler : Is this?
UNK: Okay, good.
UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
UNK: We're so glad you decided to meet our guy. You'll like him so much.
Monica : -When do you want to meet him? -I don't know.
UNK: -I don't work late tomorrow night. -Tomorrow night is good.
UNK: But why put off something till tomorrow that you could do it right now?
Chandler : -Eldad, come here! -What?
Monica : -This is Rachel. -How are you?
UNK: A little blindsided but good.
UNK: Eldad, sit down. Move over now.
Chandler : There you go. There you are.
Monica : Okay, we can take a hint!
UNK: What? What are you doing here?
Phoebe : This is Patrick.
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
UNK: You're too late because she's already with our guy.
UNK: You're right, I am too late. They're sitting on the couch and talking.
Joey : Come on.
UNK: Rachel? This is Patrick.
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
Phoebe : This is the guy I was telling you about.
Phoebe : This suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
