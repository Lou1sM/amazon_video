UNK: Okay.
UNK: I thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
UNK: That's so funny. We found someone too.
UNK: Good. She'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Chandler : -Why would our guy be a weirdo? -Because that's just your taste.
UNK: See, Rachel's not gonna pick your stupid guy.
UNK: -Yeah? -Yeah.
Phoebe : My guy is a lawyer, who does volunteer work.
Phoebe : And he has one of these.
Chandler : A face ass?
Phoebe : A chin dimple.
UNK: Well, you know, our guy works with Chandler.
UNK: He's really nice and smart, and he's a great dresser.
UNK: -Have you seen your guy's body? -No. Our guy's just a floating head.
Phoebe : Well, my guy is spectacular. He's a massage client.
UNK: And one time, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
