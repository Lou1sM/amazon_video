UNK: Well, that thing's clearly in the way.
Joey : All right.
Joey : Damn fridge!
UNK: -Hi, Joey. How you doing? -Great...
UNK: roomie.
Rachel : -I guess we are roommates. -I know.
UNK: Now that you bring it up, our fridge is broken.
UNK: We need a new one.
UNK: I checked and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
UNK: I'm not paying for that.
UNK: I'm just here while they fix my place.
Joey : Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born. Okay?
Joey : I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks!
UNK: What does that tell you?
UNK: That refrigerators don't live as long as people?
UNK: You know the ATM only lets you take out 300, so...
UNK: I'll take a check for the rest.
UNK: You're joking, right?
UNK: Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks.
UNK: Thank God, you're pretty.
UNK: I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.
UNK: There's a charity ball and Ralph Lauren has a table...
UNK: so I have to go.
UNK: -What charity? -I don't know.
Rachel : Something, either trees or disease...
Rachel : Ralph mumbles a lot.
UNK: -He mumbles when you're not attentive? -Yeah. It's weird.
UNK: But I need to find a date.
UNK: What kind of date?
Rachel : Someone that has his own tux or the ability to rent a tux.
Chandler : So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Joey : So close.
Ross : -Hey, everybody! -Hi, there.
Ross : -This is Elizabeth. -Hi, Elizabeth.
UNK: I'm the student.
UNK: Isn't she cute? Nope.
UNK: Weren't you guys supposed to...
UNK: not be seen together?
UNK: We aren't.
UNK: We just happen to have run into each other here.
Ross : This is...
Phoebe : Oh, sly!
UNK: I wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run.
Elizabeth : -See you later? -Okay.
Elizabeth : -Bye, Ross. -Bye. See you.
UNK: -Didn't mean to run into you, sir. -That's quite all right, ma'am.
UNK: Bye.
Chandler : Why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has homework?
Ross : Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Chandler : Tell her good luck with that.
UNK: Anyone else? Bring them on.
UNK: -When's her birthday? -I don't know. Why?
UNK: It's just been so long since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
Monica : -I like Elizabeth. -Well, thanks.
UNK: I like her so much, tell her I want my cookies early this year.
Monica : A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.
Joey : Give him a break. Ross, how's it going with her?
UNK: It's been great.
UNK: She's 20, so she's not too serious, which is perfect for me now.
UNK: That's great. Seriously, she seems nice.
Ross : I know you guys like to give me a hard time...
UNK: but it means a lot to me.
Ross : -Just knowing.. -Okay, I got a good one.
Phoebe : What is she, like, 12?
UNK: Chandler, do we talk about our relationship enough?
Chandler : Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
