UNK: Okay.
UNK: But, Phoebe, I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
UNK: Okay. That's okay. Have a seat.
UNK: -You can't do that! -I should go.
UNK: Sit down, we're winning.
Eldad : Maybe I should go.
All : No. Have a seat!
UNK: Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.
UNK: -He has the softest hair. Touch it. -I'm good.
Phoebe : Rachel, Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
UNK: This isn't really worth the free massage.
UNK: -That's right. Bye-bye. -No.
Chandler : Eldad is much more cooperative, and he can dance.
Chandler : You dance for Rachel.
UNK: Don't dance for me. Please!
Rachel : What is the matter with you?
UNK: Yeah, let's talk it out.
Rachel : Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
UNK: I'm a little embarrassed.
UNK: I'll tell you who should be embarrassed. It's you guys.
Rachel : I do not need you to get me a date.
Phoebe : -Why did she ask us to..? -I am still talking!
Rachel : Then you chase away the one guy I actually liked.
Rachel : No offense to you guys. Really, congratulations on...
Rachel : all the cash.
UNK: And you really do have very soft hair.
UNK: But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself than go through any more of this.
UNK: Goodbye.
Rachel : Now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
Eldad : Papaya extract.
Joey : Thank you.
Ross : So have a great time down there.
Ross : -I will. -Yeah.
Ross : -Did you pack that bathing suit? -Yeah.
Ross : It was pretty funny when I hid it for a while.
UNK: Anyway.
UNK: I am worried about that suit.
UNK: Not because it's revealing, which I'm fine with.
UNK: I'm concerned about your health.
Ross : Sun exposure.
UNK: Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.
UNK: -It's SPF 30. -All right.
UNK: Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.
Ross : Sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's 4 and...
UNK: more often than not, it's just milk.
UNK: Ross, it's gonna be okay.
UNK: I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.
Elizabeth : I really like you.
Elizabeth : I like how things are going between us.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah.
UNK: I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Ross : Okay. Cool.
Elizabeth : Here they are!
Ross : Call me!
Phoebe : Sorry for pushing those guys on you.
UNK: That's all right. I ended up having a really good time.
Rachel : The charity was a big success, and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Chandler : So, what was it for anyway?
Rachel : I wanna say a disease.
Joey : I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said to turn on MTV.
UNK: Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Elizabeth : Professor Geller.
Joey : To be 13 again...
