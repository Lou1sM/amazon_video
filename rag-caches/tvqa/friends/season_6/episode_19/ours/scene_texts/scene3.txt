UNK: Remember I told you about our fridge?
UNK: I still haven't gotten the check for your half yet.
Ross : Do not give him any money!
UNK: I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Elizabeth : -You wanted to see me, Professor Geller? -Yes. Please come in.
UNK: -Doorknob? -Yeah. It kind of grows on you.
Ross : I wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation.
UNK: Good.
Ross : Look, I...
UNK: Look, I'm having a great time with you.
UNK: And I just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.
UNK: So I'm sorry, I just don't think we should go away together yet.
UNK: It's too soon.
Elizabeth : Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
UNK: I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
UNK: No.
Elizabeth : I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
Ross : What I meant was..
Elizabeth : You are so adorable.
UNK: That. Let's talk about that.
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
Monica : How did it go with Elizabeth?
UNK: Fine. Just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her.
Ross : She just wanted to let me know she's going to Florida for a spring vacation.
Chandler : Wait a minute. Is she going for spring vacation or spring break? Wahoo!
UNK: What's the difference?
UNK: Spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents.
UNK: Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
UNK: You know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
Phoebe : -What did you do on yours? -I went to Egypt with my dad.
Chandler : I can see it now. "Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo!"
Ross : I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than : "Spring break, wahoo!"
UNK: Come on, she's taking my class.
Monica : -And slept with the professor. -I'm gonna call her.
Rachel : You guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.
UNK: We met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field and Stream.
Rachel : What? I read that.
Sebastian : -Can I get you a cup of coffee? -Yes. Thank you.
Phoebe : -Rachel, what the hell is this? -What?
UNK: You ask us to find a guy, and you come traipsing in here with a guy of your own?
Rachel : You found me a guy?
Monica : Yes. We found you a really cute, funny guy from Chandler's work.
UNK: Yeah, and I found you one too, who is not a weirdo.
UNK: You know what though, guys, I really appreciate that...
UNK: but I'm gonna take Sebastian.
Chandler : Are you sure? Our guy smells incredible.
Monica : Would you stop it with that already?
Sebastian : -Here you go. -Thank you.
Phoebe : So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Sebastian : -Not really. Why? -No reason.
Phoebe : I know a single guy who does care about other people.
Chandler : Are you funny?
Joey : -Excuse me? -What are you guys doing?
Monica : Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Sebastian : I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Phoebe : Well, so do a lot of people.
UNK: -Actually, I gotta get going. -But you..
Sebastian : -Give me a call sometime. -You didn't give me your phone number.
Sebastian : Okay, see you later.
UNK: Turns out he is kind of funny.
Rachel : I cannot believe you guys!
Rachel : He was really nice, and he just left because of you!
UNK: Yeah, but "Sebastian"? What is that, a cat's name?
UNK: You know what I noticed, Rachel? He scares easy.
