UNK: Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door.
UNK: Would you like to battle me in a post-apocalyptic world...
UNK: for control of the galaxy's last remaining energy source?
Joey : Sure, neighbor! Come on in!
Chandler : Is Janine around?
UNK: She's at dance class.
UNK: Can I check my room?
UNK: Don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: It's like a guy never lived in here.
UNK: You gotta be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading.
Joey : It is?
Chandler : Is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
UNK: Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in?
UNK: Okay, this is not good. You are a guy, okay?
UNK: This is a "guy's" place.
UNK: Soon, you'll be soaking your fingers in stuff.
UNK: And your head's gonna be under a big, brown, drying, big, drying.. It's not good.
UNK: -You're right. I'll talk to her. -Talk to her. Be a man!
UNK: -I'm a man. -Defend yourself!
Monica : We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Chandler : Be right there, sweetums.
Chandler : Totally different situation.
UNK: The One With Ross' Teeth
UNK: The one that stares at me when I come in?
Monica : The one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Ross : Still, I could tell. She was into me.
UNK: Why don't you set us up?
Rachel : Are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
UNK: Come on, I'm serious.
UNK: Okay, I'll do it, but as long as you promise you won't marry her.
UNK: Fine, I.. What if she's the one?
UNK: Man, you have a problem.
UNK: Rachel?
UNK: I'm making up flyers to try to get new massage clients.
UNK: Can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copier?
UNK: Sure, but they might think it's weird since I don't work there anymore.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! What happened?
Rachel : I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
UNK: Well, that's great! Congratulations!
