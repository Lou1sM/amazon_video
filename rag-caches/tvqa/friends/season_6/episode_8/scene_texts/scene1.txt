Rachel : A year ago.
UNK: You've lasted all year! Good for you.
UNK: You could still use the copier where I actually work.
UNK: But come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you.
UNK: Kim will freak out. She doesn't like me.
UNK: -I don't think my boss likes me. -I don't think mine likes me.
UNK: Maybe it's a universal thing.
UNK: Maybe because you're all hanging around here at 11 : 30 on a Wednesday.
UNK: Let's head off to work.
Phoebe : -Thank you. -Sure.
Phoebe : You will not believe this.
UNK: I was making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Rachel : Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?
Phoebe : A little. He seems really nice.
Phoebe : -Good kisser. -What?
UNK: What?
Rachel : -You kissed him? -Totally.
Rachel : Phoebe, are you serious?
UNK: He came in and introduced himself.
Phoebe : The next thing I know, we're making out!
UNK: Phoebe, you do know he's married?
UNK: Phoebe.
UNK: I'm supposed to ask every guy I make out with if he's married?
Phoebe : No, yeah, I should.
Janine : Hey, Joey.
Joey : Can I talk to you for a second? There's a kid in this picture.
Joey : Do you know this kid? Is it a relative?
Janine : No. I just thought it was cute.
UNK: That's what I was afraid of. Okay...
Joey : I really want you to feel at home here, but...
Joey : some of this new stuff, it's too girlie.
Janine : Like what?
Joey : Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know.
UNK: We can't have that.
UNK: Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
UNK: I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
UNK: I don't want to be a jerk, but you're changing too much around here.
UNK: I'm sorry. I wanted to make the place a little nicer.
UNK: But it's too much stuff.
UNK: You know, you got the candles and the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
Joey : Over here, you got a picture of a watering can.
Janine : I just thought..
UNK: I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
Joey : But come on.
Joey : And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
UNK: It's a curling iron.
UNK: Well, that's okay then.
Joey : Okay, my towels, for instance. I come into the bathroom...
Joey : and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it.
UNK: It's up here on some hook. And it smells different.
UNK: -It's clean. -It feels different.
UNK: It's dry.
UNK: All right, I can make my peace with the clean, dry towels.
Joey : Also what is with these chips you bought?
UNK: It's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
UNK: Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
