Joey : your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Monica : Joey, that is such a great tip!
UNK: Monica, I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
UNK: Okay, but I'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder...
UNK: out of a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Joey : I love birds.
Chandler : What is the matter with you?
UNK: -What? -You're arranging flowers!
Chandler : You got dead flowers!
UNK: You've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers!
Chandler : This is not Joey!
Joey : Look, I am still Joey, okay?
UNK: Flowers, they're just nice to look at.
Joey : And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby.
UNK: You're turning into a woman.
UNK: No, I'm not.
Joey : Why would you say that? That's just mean.
UNK: Now I've upset you? What did I say?
UNK: It's not what you said. It's the way you said it.
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: I'm a woman!
UNK: So now she thinks that I made out with him to get her job.
