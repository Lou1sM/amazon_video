UNK: What's up?
Phoebe : You know...
Chandler : Oh, my God.
Monica : What happened to your teeth?
Ross : I whitened them.
UNK: Really?
Ross : What do you think?
UNK: I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Ross : Come on, seriously.
UNK: -They're really, really, really white. -What was wrong with your old...
Chandler : human teeth?
Ross : I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to.
Monica : -How much longer? -A day.
Monica : Tonight is your date with Hillary.
UNK: I know. That's why I did it. Are they really that bad?
UNK: You'll be fine. Hillary's blind, right?
Monica : She will be after tonight.
UNK: Oh, Rach. Do you notice anything..?
Monica : Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.
UNK: You guys are never gonna believe this...
Rachel : but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
UNK: -What? -Oh, my God!
Rachel : She ran into him at my office, and they just made out.
Rachel : The craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because...
UNK: it's the best gossip she's heard all year.
Chandler : I am proud of all my friends today.
UNK: I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
UNK: I'm so jealous!
UNK: Hi, I'm Chandler, your live-in boyfriend.
Monica : Chandler, please. Come on.
Monica : Look at him.
UNK: Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish.
UNK: Here.
UNK: Who's the silver fox?
UNK: That is your make-out buddy. Don't you recognize him?
Rachel : Oh, wait.
UNK: "Phoebe, I love you. Kiss me, please."
UNK: That's not Ralph Lauren. It sounds like him, though.
UNK: -What? -Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
UNK: He's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a Hacky Sack..
UNK: Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy!
UNK: What?
Rachel : I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren.
Rachel : If she finds out that I lied to her, she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!
Phoebe : Why would the copy guy say he's Ralph Lauren?
Rachel : To get you to make out with him!
UNK: This will make them look less white.
UNK: Nope.
UNK: Colors that don't work are...
Monica : blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange and purple.
UNK: Do you wanna try this highlighter again?
UNK: No, I think it poisoned me a little.
UNK: The date starts in an hour. What am I'm gonna do?
Monica : Maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Ross : Oh, great! So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Monica : If we put just a little bit of makeup on you..
UNK: Whoa!
