UNK: We're not 13 anymore.
Monica : This is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
UNK: Won't she notice I have makeup on?
Monica : Half the guys out there have makeup on.
UNK: What?
Monica : Half the people.. I mean.. Just try it and see.
Ross : I am not putting on makeup.
UNK: Hello? Ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me?
UNK: No! Demon! Demon!
UNK: Our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Chandler : God forbid we throw out old underwear.
Chandler : You know what? I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
UNK: We've got to organize the wrapping paper.
UNK: I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.
UNK: In fact, we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
UNK: This has been a girlie day. You're right. I'm sorry.
UNK: I just feel like I need to be in a "guy" place...
UNK: do kind of a "man" thing.
UNK: You go over to Joey's and...
Monica : drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall.
UNK: When guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
UNK: When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.
UNK: I'm sorry. We do.
UNK: I don't know why I said that.
Joey : Hey, Chandler.
Joey : Come on in. We're knitting potholders.
Chandler : No, thanks, Josephine.
Chandler : Ross, I was wondering if..
Chandler : Oh, my God! Where are all the men?
Rachel : -Hi, Kim. -Hi, Rachel.
UNK: Remember what happened yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.
UNK: You didn't cancel the fabric order?
UNK: Okay, two things didn't happen.
UNK: Remember I told you someone made out with Ralph Lauren?
UNK: Well, it turns out that's not true.
UNK: It's not true? That's interesting.
UNK: Because I checked. Only one keycard was used to access the copier...
Kim : yesterday during lunch, and that keycard belonged to you.
Rachel : You think I made out with him?
Kim : Listen to me...
UNK: sleeping with Ralph is not gonna get you my job.
UNK: I don't want your job. I don't.
UNK: This is a mistake. I didn't make out with him.
Rachel : Nobody made out with him. I didn't use my keycard yesterday.
UNK: I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Kim : -Hi, Ralph. -Hi, Kim.
UNK: Yeah. Nothing happened.
Kim : You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
Hillary : After that, what could I do except become a chef?
Hillary : Soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
UNK: You're a really great listener.
Hillary : Most guys I go out with, they talk and talk.
UNK: It's like, "Shut your mouth." You know?
UNK: I've been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you?
Hillary : Come on, I want to know.
UNK: Okay. I'm from Long Island.
Ross : I came to the city for college.
UNK: I have a 5-year-old son, and in my spare time...
Ross : I like to read spy novels. But let's talk more about you.
Joey : If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan...
