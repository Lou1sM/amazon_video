UNK: -Why didn't you just tell the truth? -I did.
UNK: She doesn't think anyone would confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Phoebe : What if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?
UNK: What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy to be the pretty front man, huh?
Phoebe : Did she ever think of that?
Rachel : You were with Kenny today.
Phoebe : Just for a second.
UNK: Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
Phoebe : The only thing you can do. Sleep with him.
UNK: I'm not gonna sleep with him. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Phoebe : Sleep with Kenny.
UNK: -That wouldn't help me. -Oh, yes, it would.
UNK: I've had a really good time tonight.
Hillary : I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Ross : Me neither.
UNK: I've had a really good time too, you know.
UNK: Are you gonna eat that bread?
Ross : I just like the smell.
Hillary : You make me laugh.
UNK: Would you like to move to the couch?
UNK: Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little?
Ross : How about all the way?
UNK: Okay.
Ross : Wow, cool poster.
UNK: Or should I say, "groovy poster"?
UNK: So...
Ross : where were we?
Hillary : Are those your teeth?
Ross : You can see them, huh?
UNK: Yes. They're insanely white.
Ross : I did that for you.
UNK: What's the matter with you?
UNK: What's the matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
UNK: Oh, good. Kim, hi.
UNK: Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?
Kim : What am I thinking? Of course you have.
Rachel : Okay, look.
UNK: I'm sorry that I lied to you before.
Rachel : You were right. Ralph and I were an item, but we're not anymore.
Kim : Oh, really?
Rachel : Yeah, he dumped me.
UNK: He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.
Rachel : Even though you're a very, very...
UNK: very beautiful woman...
UNK: I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry."
Rachel : But he said, "And you will never get promoted...
Rachel : especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog...
Rachel : in the Ralph Lauren machine."
Kim : You expect me to believe..
Kim : -Hi, Ralph. -Hi, Kim.
Chandler : Oh, my God.
UNK: He gave you the coldest look I've ever seen. It's like he hates you!
Kim : Then it is true!
UNK: Of course it's true. And it hurts so bad.
UNK: Oh, honey, come here.
UNK: Oh, it'll be okay.
UNK: We've all been there.
Rachel : You and Ralph?
UNK: Kenny the copy boy.
Joey : -I need to talk to you. -What's the matter? You upset?
UNK: Would you like me to get a pint of ice cream and two spoons?
UNK: No, no, no ice cream. Look...
UNK: We gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.
UNK: I gotta be a man!
Joey : The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?
UNK: That's the way it has to be.
UNK: I'll just put it all in my room.
UNK: Good. Great.
Joey : Thanks for being so understanding.
UNK: I didn't want to make a big deal out of this.
UNK: But you could put the picture of the famous baby in my room.
Joey : I mean, if you want to.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: And maybe the watering can there.
UNK: Sure.
Joey : And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Janine : Joey, do you want me to put it all in your room?
UNK: Okay.
