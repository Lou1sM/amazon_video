UNK: Hey, you guys ever wonder why they call it "Thanksgiving"?
UNK: Okay. Hey, Monica, you're doing Thanksgiving next week, right?
UNK: Because Carol's taking Ben to her parents' place in Florida.
Ross : Okay, okay. I'll make Thanksgiving dinner.
UNK: You don't have to beg.
UNK: I didn't beg. I just asked once.
UNK: You could beg, you know.
UNK: Monica said I could make dessert this year.
UNK: -You're gonna cook something? -Hey, I cook.
UNK: Offering people gum is not cooking.
UNK: Are you sure Monica said you could cook this year?
UNK: I remember her saying in two years. You said in two years, right?
UNK: No, I promised her.
UNK: Are you sure you want to start out with something as big as Thanksgiving dinner?
UNK: I mean, maybe you wanna try a little Thanksgiving breakfast?
UNK: Maybe a Thanksgiving snack?
UNK: Come on, you guys, I can do this.
UNK: Remember, I made those peanut butter cookies.
UNK: What are you guys so worried about? Cooking is easy.
UNK: You just follow the recipe.
UNK: If it says, "boil two cups of salt," you just boil two cups of salt.
Monica : I miss Rachel.
Monica : My parents.
UNK: Great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in.
UNK: If you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great.
UNK: I was thinking we'd eat around 4.
UNK: Why can't I tell them we live together?
UNK: They don't know we're dating. Should we eat in the kitchen?
UNK: Why haven't you told them?
UNK: Well, I was going to. I really was.
Monica : But then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
UNK: Why not? Wouldn't they be happy?
UNK: So, dinner in the kitchen around 4. I'll see you then.
UNK: Why wouldn't they be happy?
Monica : Well, because...
UNK: mainly...
UNK: they don't like you.
UNK: -I'm sorry. -What? Why? Why?
Monica : Maybe because you used to be aloof...
UNK: or that you're sarcastic or that you joke around...
UNK: or that you throw your clothes on the couch.
UNK: Is this why they don't like me or you don't like me?
UNK: I know I should have told them. I shouldn't care what they think.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: It'll be okay because when they come over, I will be charming.
UNK: I will make them love me, then we'll tell them.
UNK: Will that work?
Chandler : I can be pretty charming, babe. I won you over, didn't I?
UNK: I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk.
UNK: Hey. Oh, good, Ross. Your parents like me, right?
Ross : Yes, of course they like you.
UNK: Monica told me they don't.
UNK: Yeah, they don't like you.
Chandler : Do you know why?
UNK: Maybe it's because you're sarcastic or maybe it's because you..
UNK: If people don't know, they shouldn't just guess!
Chandler : Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
UNK: Maybe I give thanks for you shutting up, huh?
UNK: Maybe I give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my place.
UNK: Maybe I love you.
Janine : Hey, guys.
UNK: No, I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Janine : Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Joey : Yeah, why?
UNK: Me and my friends are doing Thanksgiving uptown.
UNK: I thought you might like to come.
Ross : For real?
UNK: You should go to Chandler's. None of us can cook.
UNK: We'll just drink all day.
