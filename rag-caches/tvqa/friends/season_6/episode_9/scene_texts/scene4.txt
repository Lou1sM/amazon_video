Rachel : I thought this might happen today.
Rachel : I know the holidays can be rough...
UNK: and it's probably hard for you to be alone right now.
UNK: You're alone.
UNK: No, I live with Phoebe.
UNK: I mean, you're alone-alone.
UNK: And it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
UNK: Oh, well. Can't blame a guy for trying.
Joey : And if anyone needs help pretending to like it...
UNK: I learned some things in acting class. Try rubbing your stomach.
UNK: Or saying, "Mmm."
UNK: Smiling.
UNK: I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Joey : Rachel, there you are. Let's serve that dessert already!
UNK: Joey, you have to stop rushing me. You don't get any dessert.
UNK: Really?
UNK: No, just kidding. I would never do that to you.
UNK: Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
UNK: So, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
Rachel : -It sure is. -Wow.
UNK: So did you make it with beef or eggplant?
UNK: -Beef. -I can't have any. I don't eat meat.
Rachel : Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
UNK: Really?
Rachel : Wait, you only got whipped cream.
UNK: You gotta take a bite with all the layers.
Rachel : You dropped a pea.
UNK: Well?
UNK: It's good.
Rachel : Really? How good?
UNK: It's so good that I feel selfish...
Monica : about being the only one who's eating it.
Monica : I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
Monica : Especially Ross.
UNK: This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.
Chandler : So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
UNK: I've gotta call my friend...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : and tell her how good this is from Monica's room.
UNK: I'll help dial.
UNK: I'm gonna go into the bathroom...
Monica : so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.
Rachel : What was that all about? Does it not taste good?
Rachel : -Let me try it. -No, no!
Ross : All gone!
Phoebe : So good.
Ross : Maybe Chandler has some left.
Ross : It tastes like feet.
Joey : I like it!
Ross : Are you kidding?
UNK: What's not to like? Custard, good.
UNK: Jam, good. Meat, good.
Rachel : So a bird just grabbed it...
Rachel : and then tried to fly away with it...
Rachel : and then just dropped it on the street?
UNK: If it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it...
Chandler : he seemed to enjoy it.
Phoebe : Rachel, come here.
UNK: I was taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream.
UNK: -Do I want to hear this? -I don't know, let's see.
