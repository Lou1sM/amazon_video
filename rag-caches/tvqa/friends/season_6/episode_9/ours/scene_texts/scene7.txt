UNK: you remember that time you walked in my room...
Ross : and smelled marijuana?
UNK: Yes.
Ross : I told you it was Chandler...
Ross : who was smoking the pot but...
UNK: it was me. I'm sorry.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : It was you?
Monica : And Dad, Chandler didn't melt your records.
Monica : Ross did.
UNK: -Is that true? -And Dad...
UNK: you know that mailman that you got fired?
UNK: He didn't steal your Playboys. Ross did.
UNK: Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing. Monica did!
UNK: Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
UNK: [scene : Monica and Chandler are living together!
Monica : Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!
Phoebe : I love Jacques Cousteau!
UNK: I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
UNK: I want to go!
UNK: That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds.
UNK: All right. Joey, if you want to leave, just leave.
UNK: Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : It did not taste good.
UNK: Phoebe, I'm sorry...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : that you're in an important relationship is beyond me.
UNK: And we kind of figured about the porch swing.
UNK: Ross.
UNK: Drugs?
Monica : Divorced again?
UNK: Mr. Geller : What happened, son?
Ross : I got tricked into all those things.
UNK: Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : stuck by him during the drug problems...
UNK: and now you've taken on Monica as well.
UNK: Well, I don't know what to say.
UNK: You're a wonderful human being.
Rachel : -Thank you! -No.
Rachel : Thank you!
UNK: Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you.
UNK: I'll talk to them.
Rachel : You guys, it was bananas...
Rachel : cream and beef!
Rachel : I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad.
UNK: Well, actually, I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
UNK: No, I ate that.
UNK: And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
UNK: Nope, got it and got yours too.
UNK: Chandler, are you gonna stick with that bird story?
UNK: It was a big bird. Swooped right in there.
UNK: -Hi. -Oh, Janine.
UNK: -It's not over, is it? -Yeah.
UNK: We all got depressed. The holidays and everything, we're alone.
UNK: Yeah, well, at least you have Joey.
UNK: But Ross is really alone.
UNK: Well, you're always welcome here.
UNK: This is my mom and my dad.
UNK: -This is Janine. -Nice to meet you.
UNK: -I think we've already met. -Really?
UNK: I live across the hall. You walked in on me when I was changing.
