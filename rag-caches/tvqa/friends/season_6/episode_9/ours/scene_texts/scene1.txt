Joey : We go to yours!
Ross : We have to stop across the hall because it's my sister.
UNK: But, you know, actually, growing up with a sister was nice...
UNK: because it helped me understand women.
UNK: Yeah, you should tell your friends that.
UNK: Okay.
Joey : How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
UNK: Hey, Mon, look. I'm melting butter.
UNK: That's great, Rach. You now have the cooking skills of a hot day.
UNK: Phoebe, check it out! For my dessert...
UNK: I'm making a traditional English trifle.
Phoebe : Wow. That sounds great! And what are you making, Monica?
UNK: In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it...
UNK: and there's none left for anybody else!
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: Nothing?
UNK: No, sweetie. I trust you.
Rachel : If I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
UNK: You won't mess it up.
Rachel : I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank you.
Question : How do you know when the butter is done?
UNK: It's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Joey : -The food smells great, Mon. -And the place looks so nice.
Joey : -Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody! -Happy Thanksgiving!
Joey : -Well, this has been great. -See you.
Monica : Whoa, whoa, whoa!
UNK: Where you going?
UNK: We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Monica : Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
UNK: Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Phoebe : Who else is going to be there?
Joey : Her friends.
Rachel : Her dancer friends?
Joey : Yes! All right?
Joey : All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there...
UNK: and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go!
Ross : Dude, we were good.
UNK: You're not going. You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
UNK: Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls...
Phoebe : is not very Thanksgiving-y.
UNK: Oh, but it is.
UNK: It's like the first Thanksgiving when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.
UNK: Then the Indians taught the Pilgrims...
Joey : ...what it meant to be hot in the New World!
UNK: Fellas, I really think you should stay here.
UNK: You're just jealous because you can't go.
UNK: That is so not true.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : -Hello, everybody! -Hi!
UNK: Hi, Dad. Mom.
Monica : Look! Look who it is! It's Chandler!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Oh, yes, of course. Hello, Chandler.
Chandler : Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful.
UNK: It is great to have you here. Let us take your coats.
UNK: Whoa, it snowing out there?
UNK: No.
