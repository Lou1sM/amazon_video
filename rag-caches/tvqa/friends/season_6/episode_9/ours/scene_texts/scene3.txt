UNK: I don't mean tight. It's not tight. Not that I was looking at...
UNK: What's the matter with him?
UNK: I think he's stoned again.
UNK: What?
Ross : I need to talk to you.
Ross : I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
UNK: Why?
Ross : Okay, remember we were young.
Ross : Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom...
Ross : and my parents walked in and smelled it...
Ross : so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Chandler : Why did you do that?
UNK: I don't know. Yours was the first name that popped into my head.
UNK: I didn't think it'd matter.
Chandler : How could it not matter?
UNK: How was I to know we'd be friends after college...
UNK: and you'd be living with my sister?
UNK: What about the "friends forever" stuff?
UNK: I don't know. I was all high.
UNK: Mom and Dad sent me to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned.
Chandler : Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me!
UNK: I can't believe you!
UNK: We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, so fix this.
UNK: Okay, okay, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high.
Ross : Now, who should I say it was?
UNK: You! It's not like it's a big deal. You don't still do it or anything.
UNK: All right. Now, who should I say tricked me into doing it?
UNK: Nobody. You're gonna go out there and tell them exactly what happened.
UNK: -Really? -Yes!
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Wait, is there anything else I should know?
UNK: No.. Oh, yeah...
UNK: You microwaved a bunch of my dad's records.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Evidently, you weren't very good at handling your high.
UNK: Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.
UNK: And if you're gonna put your feet up..
Phoebe : Leave him alone!
Joey : Will you hurry up?
UNK: Did you not hear me when I told you that Janine's friends are dancers?
UNK: And that they're gonna be drinking a lot?
Rachel : No, I did. But tell me again because it's so romantic.
UNK: You're whipping so slow. Do it faster!
UNK: I don't want to make any mistakes!
Rachel : If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like :
UNK: "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
UNK: Just let me worry about making it, and you just worry about eating it.
Joey : Oh, I am.
UNK: -If you don't tell them, then I will. -Okay. Fine.
Joey : Ross, can I talk to you for a second?
UNK: Can it wait? I have to tell my parents something.
UNK: No, it can't? Okay.
Joey : We have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Ross : What? What is with everybody?
UNK: It's Thanksgiving, not...
UNK: Truth Day!
Joey : Look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing...
UNK: they'll all make fun of her. Do you want that?
UNK: We'll just get everyone to act like they like it.
UNK: That way, no one makes fun of her...
Ross : and we still get to go to sweet-potato pie.
UNK: Dude, they're not objects.
UNK: Just kidding. I'll talk to them. You distract her.
Ross : Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: What's up, Ross?
UNK: So...
UNK: Thanksgiving.
Ross : The holiday season is upon us.
UNK: And...
Ross : you look nice today.
UNK: -Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this. -What?
UNK: I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
