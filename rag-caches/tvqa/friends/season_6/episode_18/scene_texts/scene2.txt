Phoebe : Coming through. Coming through. Oh! Hello. Hi.
Phoebe : Right. Coming through!
UNK: Okay. It's not so bad.
UNK: Fireman #1 : Most of the damage was contained to the bedrooms.
UNK: Hey, buddy, think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday?
UNK: Fireman #1 : -Excuse me? -Joey! He's working.
Monica : You would look good in that.
Joey : Oh, how bad is it?
UNK: It's really bad.
UNK: The only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying.
UNK: -How's your room? -Everything's ruined.
Rachel : My bed, my clothes. Look at my favorite sweater.
UNK: Isn't that mine?
UNK: Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.
UNK: You won't be able to live here for a while. You have a place to stay?
UNK: Oh! Wow!
Rachel : Okay, look, pal...
Rachel : I am not in the mood to be hit on right now.
Rachel : But if you give me your number, I'll call you sometime.
Monica : Yes, they can stay with us.
UNK: Do you know what started the fire, Mr. Fireman?
UNK: Fireman #1 : Well, do either of you smoke?
UNK: No. But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks.
UNK: Fireman #1 : -Do you light candles, burn incense? -I do all the time. I love them!
UNK: Oh, my God, I did it! It's me, it's me! I burned down the house!
Rachel : Okay, Phoebe, calm down. There's no need to place blame. Okay?
Rachel : I warned her about those candles.
UNK: I can't believe how long it's been.
UNK: Hey, Chandler, is that..?
UNK: -Oh, that's great, good for you. -So, is it..?
Chandler : Okay. So, yeah, maybe we can get together...
UNK: Hold on for one second.
UNK: What?
UNK: Do you want to get a pizza later?
UNK: Hi, I'm back.
Chandler : Yeah, that sounds great. We'll do it then. Okay, bye.
UNK: When's my audition? I know it's Thursday, but what time?
UNK: Hi. We didn't get to it.
UNK: I'm taking her to coffee. We'll do it then.
UNK: Now you're going on a date with this girl?
UNK: I haven't talked to her in 10 years.
UNK: You can't just call up and ask somebody for a favor.
UNK: There are rules, you know? You gotta put in some time.
UNK: Right, I'm sorry.
UNK: -It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend. -We only went out once.
Monica : You dated her?!
Chandler : Not once.
UNK: Why don't I just go out with an ex, you know, and do Joey a favor?
UNK: You want to do Joey a favor? Maybe you go out with Joey.
UNK: That's great. My friend Joey's in the movie business.
UNK: You know who I ran into from school? Howie.
UNK: My friend's name is Joey.
UNK: Apparently, Howie's editing now.
UNK: Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
