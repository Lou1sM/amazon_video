Dana : Can you believe that?
UNK: You know, I haven't spoken to him in 10 years...
Dana : and he asks me for a favor?
UNK: Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
Dana : No "How you doing?"
Dana : Man, I mean, not even a cup of coffee first.
Chandler : -The nerve. -Yeah.
UNK: Refill?
UNK: This is last-minute, so I want to apologize for the mess.
UNK: Oh, who cares?
UNK: Oh, my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Ross : I know!
UNK: But there's only room for one, so one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
UNK: Since the fire was kind of my fault, you should get to stay here.
UNK: Hey, hey, now. This was no one's fault. It was an accident.
Phoebe : It was my fault. You should get the nice room.
UNK: Okay!
UNK: You're the first guest at "Hotel Monica."
UNK: [scene : Hotel Monica!
UNK: Just tell me how you like your eggs.
Monica : I thought I'd bring them to you in bed.
UNK: -You've been through so much. -I have.
Joey : This right here is where I keep the pizza.
UNK: And that's where the napkin is.
UNK: -What's that smell? -I know! I don't...
Elizabeth : Oh, please, it was such a big class. You never even noticed me.
Ross : What? Of course I did. You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson."
UNK: Who?
UNK: Oh. I had trouble remembering names, so I came up with nicknames.
Ross : The guy on the other side of you was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt."
Chandler : Oh, yeah.
UNK: -So did you have a nickname for me? -No. No.
Elizabeth : Yes, you did. What was it?
UNK: "Cutie McPretty."
UNK: Oh, that's so sweet!
UNK: Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.
Ross : You said it might be weird, the whole student/teacher thing?
Ross : And to be frank, I thought it would be too.
UNK: But it's not. I mean, it's not at all.
Ross : -Dr. Geller! -Burt!
Phoebe : -Did you sleep well last night? -I did.
Rachel : Monica was so sweet. She left a little mint on my pillow.
Phoebe : Know what Joey left on my pillow?
UNK: Gum.
UNK: Fireman #2 : -We determined the cause of the fire. -I know. It was my candle, my candle!
UNK: Fireman #2 : No, there was an appliance left on. It looks like a curling iron.
UNK: -I don't use a curling iron. -Someone does.
UNK: Don't look at me, my hair's straight. Straight, straight, straight.
UNK: -It could've been a hair straightener. -Oh.
Joey : This is where I keep the pizza.
UNK: And.. Hey, where'd the napkin go?
UNK: What is that?
UNK: Is that old shrimp?
UNK: I think it is!
UNK: I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes.
Phoebe : Thanks, Monica.
Monica : -Does that smell bother you? -From Joey's?
Phoebe : I can hardly smell it over here.
Monica : Well, you let me know if you can. I can bake a pie to cover it.
UNK: -I can smell it a little, bake a pie. -Okay.
UNK: Hello?
Monica : One minute, please. It's the fire inspector.
UNK: Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener...
Joey : that started the fire.
UNK: No, no. It was the candles.
UNK: Yeah. It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
Joey : In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is...
Joey : okay, well I have to go now.
Ross : We had such a great time. She's incredible.
UNK: I thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't.
