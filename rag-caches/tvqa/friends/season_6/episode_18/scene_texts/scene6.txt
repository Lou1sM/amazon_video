UNK: What? No, no, wait, wait..
UNK: You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think?
Ross : I mean, we like each other, right?
UNK: There's nothing wrong with that.
Rachel : Come on.
Ross : Burt. Lydia. Mel.
Ross : -This is Elizabeth. -Hi.
UNK: Aren't you in my popular culture class?
UNK: That's right, Lydia. Elizabeth is a student.
UNK: And we're dating.
Ross : And you may frown upon that but...
UNK: we're not gonna hide it anymore.
Mel : You are so fired.
UNK: -What? -They'll fire you.
UNK: You can't date her. It's against the rules.
Ross : Really? It's not just frowned upon?
UNK: I love it at Joey's!
UNK: -Nice! -Thanks.
Chandler : So you busy Thursday?
UNK: Oh, very funny. Remember? My audition was supposed to be Thursday.
Joey : You got me the audition? Let's hug it up!
UNK: Okay, okay! What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
Phoebe : Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.
UNK: I know they said the hair straightener started the fire.
UNK: But I think I'm partly at fault.
UNK: You see, I didn't tell you, but...
Phoebe : I had recently refilled the tissues.
UNK: And so, let's face it, that's just kindling.
UNK: So I think it's fair that I stay at Joey's.
UNK: No, no, no, this was my fault.
UNK: -Besides, I'm fine here. -Okay.
UNK: -Chandler, Monica's looking for you. -Really?
Phoebe : -She said something about crumbies. -No, no, no! I was so careful.
Phoebe : You have to switch with me. Monica is driving me crazy.
UNK: That's right. All the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
UNK: No, I don't want to switch.
UNK: Please! I can throw wet paper towels here!
UNK: No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink.
UNK: I know. I'm sorry.
Phoebe : All right, fine.
Phoebe : This looks like so much fun. God, what a mess.
Ross : Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
UNK: I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
UNK: I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
UNK: For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me.
UNK: That felt really nice.
UNK: Kind of made me like you even more.
Ross : I know, I know. I really like you too. But we can't date.
UNK: It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
UNK: -Wow. -What?
Elizabeth : Just hearing you describe it as "forbidden"...
UNK: it's really hot.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's wrong.
Elizabeth : -Stop it. -No, no. It's wrong.
UNK: It's naughty.
UNK: It's...
UNK: taboo.
Elizabeth : Shut the book.
UNK: Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: -So? -So...?
UNK: It's Thursday! How was the audition?
UNK: It's.. Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, what day..
UNK: Oh!
