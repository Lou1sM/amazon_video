UNK: I got my teacher evaluations. Look what this student wrote.
UNK: "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind-blowing lectures.
Ross : You are definitely the hottie of the Paleontology Department."
UNK: "Hotties of Paleontology." There's a big-selling calendar.
Rachel : -Who wrote it? -The evaluations are all anonymous.
UNK: -You have their exams? -Yeah.
UNK: You could just match the handwriting and there's your admirer.
UNK: A hot girl's at stake and he's Rain Man.
Rachel : Wait a minute. Why are we so sure that this is a girl?
UNK: It's a girl!
UNK: But it wouldn't matter.
UNK: Because I'm a teacher. She's a student.
UNK: -It's illegal? -It's frowned upon.
UNK: -And there's a big age gap. -When you're 90..
UNK: I know, she'll be 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
UNK: That's not what I was gonna say.
UNK: When you're 90, you'll still have the memory of being with a 20-year-old.
