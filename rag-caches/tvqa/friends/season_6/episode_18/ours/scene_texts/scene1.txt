UNK: I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie.
Ross : -That was you? -Yeah.
UNK: I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student.
UNK: Want to go out sometime?
UNK: That's not the best idea.
UNK: Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over.
UNK: -You're not my teacher anymore. -What time?
UNK: Oh, you know what? Forget it.
UNK: I see you already gave me an A.
UNK: -Gotcha. -I'm kidding! God!
Ross : So seriously, what time?
