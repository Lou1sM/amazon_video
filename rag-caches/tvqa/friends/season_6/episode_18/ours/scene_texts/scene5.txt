UNK: -Yeah. What should I do? -Well, it seems pretty clear.
UNK: What's more important? What people think or how you feel?
Joey : -You gotta follow your heart. -Joey, that's so sweet.
UNK: -Hi. -Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?
Joey : Any reason I should leave a block of time open? Say, Thursday?
UNK: -I couldn't do it. -You couldn't do it?
UNK: I need more time. We're going to dinner.
UNK: You're going out with her again?
Ross : -Going out with who? -Dana Keystone, from college.
UNK: Oh, yeah. Wasn't she...?
UNK: No, that was Dana Kaplan.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: -Joey, you didn't even know her! -Yeah, whatever.
Chandler : Great story again.
Chandler : The yarns that you weave!
UNK: You know, actually, I should get going.
UNK: Oh, no, no, stay! Because you should stay.
Dana : Oh, I am really flattered.
Dana : But I just... I don't feel that way about you.
UNK: Oh, no, no. That's not..
UNK: I'm sorry, Chandler. You know, you're such a sweet guy...
UNK: and I don't want to hurt you.
UNK: I wish I could do something to make you feel better.
UNK: No.. Really?
Ross : Of course.
Chandler : Well, it just hurts so bad, I...
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry.
Chandler : -Maybe there is one thing you can do. -What? Anything. Anything.
UNK: Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now.
Chandler : But I have this friend.. This actor friend.
UNK: He would kill me if he knew that I was doing this.
UNK: But...
Chandler : would it be possible for him to audition for your movie on Thursday?
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: But...
UNK: you'd really feel better if your friend could audition for my movie?
UNK: The heart wants what it wants. Bye.
UNK: Hey! How's it going?
Phoebe : Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Monica : Yes, it has. I made cookies!
UNK: I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Monica : But you should eat them now, because they're hot from the oven.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: But not in here! Can't eat them in bed, remember? No crumbies!
UNK: Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second.
UNK: Okay.
Monica : -What are you doing? -This doesn't lock, does it?
UNK: -Oh! Joey, I'm sorry. -It's all right, don't worry about it.
Rachel : But look! That's gonna leave a stain.
UNK: Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah, look.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: -I've never lived like this before. -I know.
UNK: Well, don't waste it. I mean, it's still food.
Ross : What do you want to do now? Want to get a drink?
UNK: I can't.
Ross : -Oh, you have some studying to do? -No, I have some turning 21 to do.
UNK: You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to..
Monica : -What are you doing? -Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.
Elizabeth : Do you not want to be seen with me?
UNK: No, of course I do. Are they gone?
UNK: No, they're still here. But I think I'm about to leave.
