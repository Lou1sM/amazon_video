UNK: I'm moving out, so you're in charge of paying the rent.
UNK: -When's it due? -On the first.
UNK: And that's every month?
Chandler : No, just the months you want to live here.
UNK: Okay, here's the phone bill.
Joey : Oh, my God!
UNK: That's our phone number.
UNK: I know I kind of sprung this me-moving-out-on-you thing.
UNK: -Why don't I cover you for a while? -No way!
Joey : Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...
UNK: anymore.
UNK: -It's not charity, Joe. -Forget it.
UNK: Thanks, but I'm done taking money from you.
UNK: I can take care of myself. What's next? Come on.
