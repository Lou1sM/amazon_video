UNK: I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now.
UNK: He's smiling, though.
Ross : Okay, talk to you later.
UNK: You know, Daddy was gonna be a basketball player.
Phoebe : I think it was better when you guys were sad.
UNK: Hey, remember the Rollerblades?
UNK: You know what else I won't miss? "I'm Monica.
UNK: I wash the toilets 17 times a day, even if people are on it!"
UNK: "Hi, I'm Rachel. Is my sweater too tight?
UNK: I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
UNK: "I'm Monica. I never get messages from interesting people."
Phoebe : I call her.
Monica : "Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross!"
UNK: "My God! I can't find a boyfriend.
UNK: I'll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find there!"
UNK: You guys, come on, this is the last night!
UNK: Yeah, you're right, and so for the last time I would like to ask you :
UNK: Boo-hoo. Get out of my room!
UNK: We should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.
Chandler : Still broken?
UNK: It sucks, man.
UNK: Your last night, and I lose the two most important things :
Joey : The foosball table...
Joey : and $500.
UNK: There are other ways to win back your money. How about blackjack?
Joey : Not my game.
Rachel : You know what? We can play a new game.
UNK: -It's fun! -What's it called?
UNK: Cups.
UNK: -I don't know how. -I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.
Joey : -All right. -Here you go.
Chandler : I have two queens. What do you have?
UNK: -A 2 and a 5. -You win! Fifty dollars!
UNK: -Really? -Let's play again.
UNK: -What have you got? -4 and a 9.
UNK: You're kidding, right?
Joey : -No. Why? -That's a full cup!
Joey : Damn, I am good at Cups!
UNK: I'm not talking to her.
UNK: You have to take the first step...
UNK: because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her.
UNK: Maybe you're right.
UNK: But she made fun of my phone pen!
Phoebe : I know. I took it hard too.
UNK: She's in there right now, crying. I can hear her.
UNK: She's not crying.
UNK: She's holding it in. She's so brave. Go.
UNK: I feel bad about what happened..
Monica : -What are you doing? -I'm unpacking.
UNK: I'm not moving. Is that picture straight?
Monica : It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left.
UNK: You're the one who wants this big change and to move in with Chandler!
UNK: You should go! Why do I have to leave?
UNK: -It's my apartment! -It's mine too! What else you got?
UNK: How about : You're moving!
Rachel : This is ridiculous.
Rachel : We should be packing you!
UNK: -Hey, how you guys doing? -Great. Monica's moving.
Monica : I am not!
UNK: Really? How come all your stuff is in this box?
Phoebe : Okay, you guys, I think I know what's going on here!
