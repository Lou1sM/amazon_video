Joey : Here it is.
Joey : Our last pizzas together as roommates.
UNK: I wish I knew that. I ordered Chinese.
UNK: Well, that's okay.
UNK: In a way it's kind of nice. You know?
UNK: Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors...
Joey : you, the food of yours!
UNK: I had an idea for what to do on our last night.
Chandler : What do you say we play a little foosball for money?
UNK: Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me since my injury-plagued '97 season.
UNK: -It'd be easier to give me your money. -Yes, it would.
Chandler : What do you say to $50?
UNK: I say to it : "50 dollars, you are more than I have."
