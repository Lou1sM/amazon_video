UNK: If you know that you'll win, what difference does it make?
UNK: -You're on. -Okay, let's play.
UNK: The big game. Italy versus...
Chandler : China, apparently.
UNK: Look, it's the Rollerblades.
Monica : Oh, God!
Rachel : You remember when we got these?
UNK: I guess you weren't there.
Phoebe : You guys, we said we were gonna have fun.
Phoebe : Come on. Hey, remember the time...
UNK: You don't remember?
UNK: Sorry, Phoebe. I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.
UNK: I'm gonna miss you so much.
UNK: This doesn't have to be so sad, though, you know?
UNK: Instead of thinking about how you'll miss each other...
UNK: you should think of the things you're not gonna miss.
UNK: I don't think there's anything.
UNK: Come on, there's gotta be something.
UNK: She's perfect.
Rachel : I have one.
UNK: Okay, you can go first.
UNK: I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...
UNK: that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
UNK: That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything?
Rachel : You know, does Rachel move the phone pen?
UNK: Sometimes.
Monica : Always, actually.
Phoebe : There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better?
Monica : Not just the phone pen.
Monica : I never get my messages.
Rachel : You get your messages.
UNK: It doesn't count if you have to read them off your hand...
UNK: after you've fallen asleep on the couch.
Rachel : So you missed a message from who? Chandler?
Rachel : Or your mom?
Rachel : Or Chandler?
Rachel : Or your mom?
UNK: It worked! No one's sad!
Joey : I win again!
UNK: That's, like, 500 bucks you owe me!
UNK: Man! Five hundred dollars.
UNK: That is a lot of electricity, huh?
Joey : I gotta buy some food.
Chandler : Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death...
Chandler : one goal, $1000.
Joey : -You serious? -Yes!
Joey : Get ready to owe me.
Joey : Here we go. Ready?
UNK: No...
Chandler : one can beat me!
UNK: That's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.
Monica : Hi, Ross. See, other people call me!
Rachel : Oh, your brother. Score!
UNK: What's up?
UNK: I'm here with Ben.
UNK: Thought we'd say hi.
Monica : -Put him on. -Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
