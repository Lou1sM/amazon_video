Joey : The same way you lost!
UNK: I started out with the king and the queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.
Joey : Then I get a jack and a king. Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.
UNK: Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup...
UNK: the sitting-down bonus. I didn't even get half a cup! Nothing!
Chandler : Oh, man!
Joey : He never played before either.
UNK: I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups!
UNK: Let's play one more hand. One more hand.
Joey : No more! I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time.
Joey : In fact, look.
Joey : I wanna give you something.
UNK: Let me give it to you before I pawn it for Cups money.
Joey : I want you to have the big, white dog...
UNK: as a thank-you for being such a great roommate.
UNK: I can't take the big white dog. You love it.
UNK: It's "him." Not "it."
Chandler : What if I bought it from you?
UNK: Then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.
UNK: Say $1500?
Joey : Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here.
UNK: You're trying to give me money again!
Chandler : When did I try to give you money?
UNK: Over there with the bills!
UNK: You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it.
Joey : We had a nice last night together.
Joey : We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money.
UNK: Now you start with the charity thing again!
UNK: I'm trying to help you out. I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Joey : I will be okay.
Joey : You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself.
UNK: I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money.
UNK: The only thing I'm gonna miss...
Joey : is you.
Joey : And now the dog.
Monica : -Call me when you get there, okay? -Okay.
UNK: I'm really gonna miss you.
Rachel : I have your key.
Phoebe : -Here you go. -Thanks.
Rachel : God, this is silly. I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Rachel : Bye, house.
Monica : -She really left. -I know.
Monica : -Thank you. -No problem, roomie.
Monica : -Can I ask you a question? -Sure.
Monica : What the hell is that dog doing here?
Chandler : I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Ross : -And now you want that money back? -Exactly.
UNK: What kind of idiot do you take me for?
UNK: It's not a real game. I made it up.
UNK: I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square.
Chandler : At a fake game!
Ross : If you wanna try to make some of it back...
UNK: I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you.
Ross : I am very good at Cups.
Chandler : I assume the saucer card came up when you played last.
UNK: Let's see if it comes up this time.
