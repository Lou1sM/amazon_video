Monica : I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth.
Monica : And since it's Rachel's birthday...
Monica : ...I thought I'd poach a salmon.
UNK: What?
Ross : Question. Why do we always have parties where you poach things?
UNK: You want to be on the food committee?
UNK: Question 2. Why do we always have parties with committees?
UNK: Why can't we just get pizza and beer and have fun?
UNK: I agree. Fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside.
UNK: And I'm not sure we are.
UNK: You don't want it to be special?
Monica : Fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Monica : Joey, they're not real!
Monica : I start miles beneath the surface of these things. They're fake.
UNK: See? Honk, honk!
UNK: Wow, it's like porno for clowns!
