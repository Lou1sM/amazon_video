UNK: The One With Two Parties
UNK: Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.
UNK: I still have to invite Dylan and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Joey : No Shannon Cooper.
Phoebe : Why not her?
UNK: Because she...
Joey : She steals stuff.
UNK: Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept with her and never called her back.
UNK: Joey, that is horrible.
Joey : Hey, I liked her.
Joey : Maybe too much.
Joey : I don't know.
Joey : I guess I just got scared.
Phoebe : I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Joey : I didn't think anyone would buy that. Okay!
Ross : Hi, honey. How did it go?
Rachel : It was the graduation from hell.
Chandler : My cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
UNK: It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.
UNK: My sister would graduate from college. Nobody thought she would.
UNK: It's a testament to what a girl from Long Island will do for a Celica.
Monica : What happened?
Rachel : My parents happened.
Rachel : All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile...
Rachel : ...and not talk about the divorce. But no!
UNK: They got into a fight during the commencement address.
Rachel : Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them.
UNK: You know the good news?
Rachel : I get to serve coffee for the next eight hours.
Phoebe : I guess we don't invite her parents.
UNK: - How about just her mom? - Why her mom?
UNK: Because I already invited her.
Phoebe : Did you ask Stacy Roth?
Joey : Can't invite her.
