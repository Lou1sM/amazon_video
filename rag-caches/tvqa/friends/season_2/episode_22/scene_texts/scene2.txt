Joey : She also steals.
UNK: So does her roomate.
UNK: Here are the candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Monica : We're not having birthday cake.
Monica : We're having birthday flan.
Chandler : Excuse me?
Monica : It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Joey : That's nice.
Joey : Happy birthday, Rachel. Here's some goo!
Monica : Dr. Greene!
Monica : Oh, my God! It's Rachel's dad.
UNK: Why are you here?
UNK: The father can't see the daughter on her birthday?
Monica : No, no, the father can.
Monica : But since I am the roommate, I can tell you she's not here.
Monica : And I'll pass along the message. Okay? So bye-bye.
UNK: You're having a party.
Monica : No, no, not a party.
Monica : Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows.
UNK: - This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey. - I'll never remember all that.
UNK: Mr. Greene : So what's the deal?
UNK: Mr. Greene : Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff? Is that it?
Chandler : This isn't your first surprise party, is it, sir?
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Hi, Monica.
UNK: The Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Chandler : So basically, just a Chinese guy.
UNK: Dr. Greene, come with me. We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Ross : All right. That sounds like a two-person job.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Well, my goodness! What was that?
UNK: Sandra, I thought you were Rachel. We weren't ready for you yet.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : - You thought I was Rachel? - Yes, because you look so young.
Phoebe : And because you're both, you know, white women.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Oh, I missed you kids. Should I put my coat in the bedroom?
UNK: - No, I'll take that for you. - Oh, well, thank you.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Such a gentleman. Thank you.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : It all looks so nice. So festive. All the balloons.
UNK: Oh, the funniest thing happened to me on the way here.
UNK: - I was driving - That's great!
Phoebe : I can't wait to hear the rest, but I have to go to the bathroom.
Phoebe : Hey, come with me.
Monica : - What? - It will be like we're gal pals.
UNK: You know, like at a restaurant. It'll be fun! Come on.
Monica : Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
UNK: Think. Think.
Chandler : What would Jack and Chrissy do?
UNK: Okay, now that your coat is safely in the bed
Joey : We can come back out in the living room.
UNK: Joey and Chandler, it's time you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
UNK: Yes, absolutely.
Chandler : Why, again?
Monica : Because that's where the party is, you goon!
Monica : - See, this is just the staging area. - Right, it's the staging area.
Joey : This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
UNK: All right, you guys are off to party number one.
Chandler : And you...
Chandler : You are off to party number two.
UNK: All right, let's keep it moving, let's keep it moving.
Monica : At least send some women to my party.
UNK: Okay, that's Ross. All right.
UNK: Okay, they're coming.
UNK: Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.
Ross : Thanks for being born.
UNK: Thank you for my beautiful earrings. They're perfect.

UNK: Surprise!
Rachel : Oh, my gosh!
UNK: Wow!
Rachel : Oh, my God. Mom!
Rachel : This is so great!
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Happy birthday, sweetie.
Rachel : You! I had no idea!
Joey : - Really? - No, I knew.

UNK: Weird.
UNK: Surprise!
UNK: Happy birthday, sweet pea.
UNK: Daddy!
Rachel : Both of them are here? Both of them? Both of them are here?
Chandler : Well, we could count again?
Rachel : I can't believe this!
UNK: You know, this is ridiculous.
UNK: This is your birthday, your party.
UNK: Let's put them together. If they can't deal with it, who cares?
Joey : - I do. - That's who.
UNK: Are you gonna be okay?
Rachel : I don't really have a choice. I can look at the bright side.
Rachel : I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Chandler : Well, actually...
