Chandler : Some girl just walked up to me and said, "I want you, Dennis"...
UNK: ...and stuck her tongue down my throat.
Chandler : I love this party!
Joey : - Quick volleyball question. - Volleyball.
Joey : We set up a court in your room.
UNK: You didn't like that gray lamp, did you?
UNK: A woman stuck her tongue down my throat. I'm not even listening to you.
Chandler : - Dennis! - Okay, that's me.
Rachel : Can you keep Dad occupied? I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.
Ross : Do you have any ideas for any openers?
UNK: Stay clear of "I'm the guy that's doing your daughter"...
UNK: ...and you should be okay.
Monica : I want you to take a piece of paper
Monica : Here you go. And write down your most embarrassing memory.
Monica : When you're not using the markers, put the caps back on them...
Monica : ...because they will dry out.
Ross : Hi, Dr. Greene.
Ross : So how's everything in the...
Ross : ...vascular surgery...
UNK: ...game?
UNK: Mr. Greene : It's not a game, Ross. A woman died on my table today.
Phoebe : I'm sorry.
Ross : That's the good thing about my job.
Ross : All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
UNK: Listen, I don't mean to be a pain about this...
UNK: ...but I've noticed some of you are just placing them on.
UNK: You want to push the caps...
Monica : ...until you hear them click.
UNK: Gunther!
UNK: Where you going?
UNK: I was sort of thinking about maybe
Monica : No! No, you can't go! No, this is fun.
UNK: We're just starting. Here's your marker.
UNK: If you want to go, just go.
Gunter : She'll yell at me again.
UNK: All right, I can get you out.
UNK: What?
UNK: In a minute, I'll create a diversion.
Phoebe : When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
UNK: Mr. Greene : - I think I need a drink. - I'll get it for you.
UNK: - What do you want? - Scotch.
Ross : I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
UNK: Neat!
UNK: Cool.
UNK: Mr. Greene : Neat, as in no rocks.
Ross : I know.
UNK: Mr. Greene : Hello, Ross! Where have you been?
Ross : I have been in the bathroom.
Ross : Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Scotch neat.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : That's Rachel's father's drink.
Ross : Mine too. Isn't that neat?
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Scotch neat.
Ross : Would you excuse me?
UNK: Where are you sneaking off to, mister?
UNK: Mr. Greene : I'm getting my cigarettes.
UNK: No.
UNK: What do you mean "no"?
UNK: See, because that's the staging area.
Ross : You go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.
Ross : Take your scotch back in there...
Ross : ...and I will get your cigarettes for you, sir.
UNK: Mr. Greene : - Get my glasses too. - All righty-roo.
Ross : What a great moment to say that for the first time.
UNK: Okay, the first person's most embarrassing memory is...
UNK: ..."Monica, your party sucks."
Monica : Very funny.
UNK: Oh, no! Did someone forget to use a coaster?
UNK: What?
Monica : I don't see anything.
Phoebe : Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Ross, whose glasses are those?
UNK: Mine.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : You wear bifocals?
Ross : I have a condition apparently...
Ross : ...that I require...
Ross : ...two different sets of focals.
UNK: Do you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Rachel : Well, those are very popular frames.
Ross : Neil Sedaka wears them.
Guy : I hear you can get people out of here.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : You didn't tell me your boyfriend smokes.
Rachel : Yeah, like a chimney.
Ross : Big smoker.
Ross : Big, big smoker.
UNK: In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
UNK: Mr. Greene : Are you wearing my glasses?
UNK: Yes.
Ross : I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Thank you.
UNK: Mr. Greene : Is that one of my cigarettes?
Ross : Yes, it is. I was just moistening the tip.
Phoebe : She's taking the trash out, so I can get you out of here.
Phoebe : But it has to be now. She'll be back any minute.
