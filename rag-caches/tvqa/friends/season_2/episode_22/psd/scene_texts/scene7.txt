UNK: Dr. Greene, come with me. We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Ross : All right. That sounds like a two-person job.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Well, my goodness! What was that?
UNK: Sandra, I thought you were Rachel. We weren't ready for you yet.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : - You thought I was Rachel? - Yes, because you look so young.
Phoebe : And because you're both, you know, white women.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Oh, I missed you kids. Should I put my coat in the bedroom?
UNK: - No, I'll take that for you. - Oh, well, thank you.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : Such a gentleman. Thank you.
UNK: Mrs. Greene : It all looks so nice. So festive. All the balloons.
UNK: Oh, the funniest thing happened to me on the way here.
UNK: - I was driving - That's great!
Phoebe : I can't wait to hear the rest, but I have to go to the bathroom.
Phoebe : Hey, come with me.
Monica : - What? - It will be like we're gal pals.
UNK: You know, like at a restaurant. It'll be fun! Come on.
Monica : Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
UNK: Think. Think.
Chandler : What would Jack and Chrissy do?
UNK: Okay, now that your coat is safely in the bed
Joey : We can come back out in the living room.
UNK: Joey and Chandler, it's time you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
UNK: Yes, absolutely.
Chandler : Why, again?
Monica : Because that's where the party is, you goon!
Monica : - See, this is just the staging area. - Right, it's the staging area.
Joey : This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
UNK: All right, you guys are off to party number one.
Chandler : And you...
Chandler : You are off to party number two.
UNK: All right, let's keep it moving, let's keep it moving.
Monica : At least send some women to my party.
UNK: Okay, that's Ross. All right.
UNK: Okay, they're coming.
