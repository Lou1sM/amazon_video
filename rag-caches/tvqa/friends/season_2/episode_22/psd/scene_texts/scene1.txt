UNK: I agree. Fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside.
UNK: And I'm not sure we are.
UNK: You don't want it to be special?
Monica : Fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Monica : Joey, they're not real!
Monica : I start miles beneath the surface of these things. They're fake.
UNK: See? Honk, honk!
UNK: Wow, it's like porno for clowns!
UNK: The One With Two Parties
UNK: Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.
UNK: I still have to invite Dylan and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Joey : No Shannon Cooper.
Phoebe : Why not her?
UNK: Because she...
Joey : She steals stuff.
UNK: Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept with her and never called her back.
