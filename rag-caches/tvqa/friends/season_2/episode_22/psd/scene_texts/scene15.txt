UNK: What?
UNK: In a minute, I'll create a diversion.
Phoebe : When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
UNK: Mr. Greene : - I think I need a drink. - I'll get it for you.
UNK: - What do you want? - Scotch.

UNK: Neat!
UNK: Cool.
UNK: Mr. Greene : Neat, as in no rocks.

UNK: Mr. Greene : Hello, Ross! Where have you been?
