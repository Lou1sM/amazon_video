UNK: We'll get that for you.
Ross : All right, all right. I can get my own coat.
Chandler : Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
UNK: Oh, no. No, you're not supposed to be here.
Phoebe : This is the staging area. It's all wrong. You should leave.

Phoebe : I guess we're going back into the hallway again.
Joey : Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.
