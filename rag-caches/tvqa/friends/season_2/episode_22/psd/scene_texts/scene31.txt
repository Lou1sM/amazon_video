Rachel : ...go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.
Rachel : Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.
Rachel : My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side...

UNK: And when we did help, he'd scream at us for doing it wrong.
Rachel : But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.
Rachel : You know, and it'd get really cold.
