Rachel : You know, actually, it's more like, hi!
Susan : This could go on for a while.
UNK: You're right. We've got a cab waiting.
Ross : Well, this was fun.
UNK: We should do it again sometime, Ben. What do you say?
UNK: - All right, so I've got him...? - Tuesday.
Ross : Bye, you guys.
Rachel : - Take care. - Bye, Ben.
UNK: Did he just say "bye"?
Rachel : He said bye!
Rachel : You said bye! He said bye to me!
UNK: Yes, he did!
Susan : Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college!
Chandler : We've gotta go. We've got that cab downstairs.
UNK: See you later.
UNK: Look at this nice deep hole I dug. Hey, Bert...
Ernie : ...isn't this a nice hole here?
Phoebe : Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.
Phoebe : Now, I've looked ahead on the tape, and he does find him again.
UNK: But before that happens, there's some rough going for a while.
