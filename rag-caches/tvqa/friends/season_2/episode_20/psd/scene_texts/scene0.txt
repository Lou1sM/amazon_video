UNK: - What you guys doing? - Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
UNK: Why are you guys upset? It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.
Rachel : - What? - What are you talking about?
UNK: Come on. Happy family gets a dog.
Phoebe : Frontier fun!
UNK: Pheebs, what about the end?
UNK: When Yeller saves the family and everyone's happy?
Rachel : That's not the end.
Phoebe : That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say, "The end."
UNK: What about when he has rabies?
Phoebe : He doesn't have rabies. He has babies.
Phoebe : That's what my mom said.
UNK: I don't think she'd want you to see what's about to happen.
UNK: Why? What's about to happen?
Phoebe : I've never seen this part.
UNK: Hey, Travis, what you doing with that gun?
Phoebe : Oh, no.
Phoebe : No, no, Travis, put down the gun.
UNK: No, no, he's your buddy. He's your Yeller.
Phoebe : No! The end! The end!
UNK: Okay, what kind of a sick doggy snuff film is this?
UNK: Have you guys eaten? Richard and I just finished, and we've got leftovers.
Monica : Chicken and potatoes.
Monica : What am I wearing?
Monica : Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
UNK: One of these times, you'll really be naked and we won't come over.
UNK: That teach me a lesson.
UNK: I got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Chandler : How do you find clothes that fit?
UNK: Hey, Monica? We got a question.
UNK: All right, yes, I see other women in the shower at the gym.
Monica : And no, I don't look.
Joey : No, not that one.
UNK: We're figuring out who to bring to the Nicks game.
Chandler : Ross can't go, so it's between my friend Eric Prower, who has breath issues...
