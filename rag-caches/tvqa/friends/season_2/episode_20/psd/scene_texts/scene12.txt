Rachel : - What? - What?
Rachel : You think about stuff like that?
Ross : Yeah. I mean...
UNK: Actually, I kind of think that we'll have two babies.
Ross : Two babies?
UNK: You know, a boy and a girl.
Ross : Hopefully, the girl will come first, so Ben won't feel competitive.
Rachel : Then what's gonna happen?
Ross : We won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll move to Scarsdale.
UNK: We'll be far enough from our parents so we don't have to see them...
Ross : ...but close enough that they can baby-sit.
Ross : And yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than Nassau County...
