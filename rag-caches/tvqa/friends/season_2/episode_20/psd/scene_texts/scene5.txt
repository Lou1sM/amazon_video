UNK: We were playing on the floor, and he grabs the table...
Ross : ...and he pulls himself up!
Ross : He pulled himself up!
Ross : Standing man!
UNK: I'm sorry you missed it, but I did tape it if you wanna see it.
Carol : We know. He already did it last week.
Susan : You can watch our tape if you want.
UNK: See, I don't believe this. I missed the first time of everything.
