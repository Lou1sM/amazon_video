UNK: Have you guys eaten? Richard and I just finished, and we've got leftovers.
Monica : Chicken and potatoes.
Monica : What am I wearing?
Monica : Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
UNK: One of these times, you'll really be naked and we won't come over.
UNK: That teach me a lesson.
UNK: I got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Chandler : How do you find clothes that fit?
UNK: Hey, Monica? We got a question.
UNK: All right, yes, I see other women in the shower at the gym.
Monica : And no, I don't look.
Joey : No, not that one.
UNK: We're figuring out who to bring to the Nicks game.
Chandler : Ross can't go, so it's between my friend Eric Prower, who has breath issues...
Chandler : ...and Dan, with the poking. "Did you see that play?"
UNK: "You want more beer? Is that Spike Lee?"
Monica : Why don't you ask Richard?
Joey : Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Nicks game...
Joey : ...and you had to choose between a friend who smelled...
Joey : ...and one who bruises you, who would you pick?
UNK: Being a huge Nicks fan myself...
Richard : ...I think you should take someone who's a huge Nicks fan.
