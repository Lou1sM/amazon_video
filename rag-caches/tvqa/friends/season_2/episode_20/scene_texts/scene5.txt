UNK: IKick, save! And...
UNK: ...denied!
Richard : He gets it back. Pass to the middle, lines it up...
UNK: Yes!
Richard : Could that shot be any prettier?
Joey : Man, you are incredible.
Richard : We had a table in college.
Chandler : Really? I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800s.
UNK: Nice mustache. At puberty, that thing will really kick in.
Monica : Not to sound too Florence Henderson, but dinner's on the table.
Richard : One more point.
UNK: Score!
Monica : Now can we go?
Chandler : That's why we don't let her play.
Richard : Is everything all right?
Chandler : Don't be mad at him. It's our fault.
UNK: I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.
Joey : He's just really great to hang out with.
Chandler : - Well... - No, seriously.
UNK: We just talked about this. He is so much cooler than our dads.
UNK: Our dads are okay and all, but Richard is just
UNK: What are you kicking me for?
UNK: I'm trying to talk here.
Richard : You guys see me as a dad?
Rachel : - Oh, yeah! - No!
UNK: You're just clearly not familiar with our young persons' vernacular.
UNK: When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."
UNK: We mean "pal."
Chandler : No, seriously. Joey's my dad.
Chandler : Monica's my dad.
Chandler : I've even got some dads down at work.
Richard : That's fine.
Richard : Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening.
Richard : I'll just see you kids around.
UNK: Nighty-night.
Chandler : You're not a dad!
Chandler : I can't believe you got us into trouble.
UNK: So are you okay?
UNK: Just...
Richard : ...I feel like I'm about a hundred.
Richard : I thought I was just one of the guys.
Monica : Come here.
Monica : I'll make you feel like one of the guys.
Monica : For a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
UNK: I was killing them.
Monica : Yeah, well they suck too.
UNK: You take the poopy diaper and put it in the poopy diaper pail.
UNK: Calling it a "poopy diaper" doesn't make this process any cuter.
Carol : - It's us. - Come on up.
UNK: I'll get his stuff together.
UNK: Okay, we can do this now, can't we, Ben?
Rachel : Yes, we can.
Rachel : Yes, we can.
Rachel : There! I did it!
Rachel : I did it!
Rachel : Look at that!
UNK: It stays on and everything.
Rachel : I'm sorry. What did you just say? Did you just say "hi"?
Rachel : Oh, my God! Ross? Ben just said hi!
Rachel : - What? - Ben just said hi!
UNK: What, the word "hi"?
Rachel : No, my Uncle Hi.
UNK: Great! And I missed that too. I miss everything!
Rachel : Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just bring it out in him.
Monica : - Where is he? - We missed you.
UNK: We missed you so much! Come here, Ben.
Rachel : Guess what? Ben just said his first word.
Carol : What did he say?
Ross : Something about hi.
Susan : That's so exciting! Mommy's so proud of you!
Rachel : You know, actually, it's more like, hi!
Susan : This could go on for a while.
UNK: You're right. We've got a cab waiting.
Ross : Well, this was fun.
UNK: We should do it again sometime, Ben. What do you say?
UNK: - All right, so I've got him...? - Tuesday.
Ross : Bye, you guys.
Rachel : - Take care. - Bye, Ben.
UNK: Did he just say "bye"?
Rachel : He said bye!
Rachel : You said bye! He said bye to me!
UNK: Yes, he did!
Susan : Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college!
Chandler : We've gotta go. We've got that cab downstairs.
UNK: See you later.
UNK: Look at this nice deep hole I dug. Hey, Bert...
Ernie : ...isn't this a nice hole here?
Phoebe : Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.
Phoebe : Now, I've looked ahead on the tape, and he does find him again.
UNK: But before that happens, there's some rough going for a while.
Phoebe : But I think we can handle it.
Phoebe : And there's just the alphabet, but we know that ends well, so...
Ross : Here we go.
Ernie : Bert? Bert?
Ernie : What happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago.
Ernie : Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.
Phoebe : I'm so glad you're here.
