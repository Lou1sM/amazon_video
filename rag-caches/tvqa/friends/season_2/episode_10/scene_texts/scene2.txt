Ross : Not at all.
Ross : I love this guy!
UNK: I'm so excited to hear you're back with my sister.
Mnca : - You and me both! - So what'd I miss?
UNK: We were trying to make Joey feel better.
Fbob : Need me to pick you up?
UNK: No, I'm all right, man.
Fbob : No, I'm picking you up!
Joey : No, seriously. I don't need you to
Joey : It still works!
Fbob : Before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?
Fbob : I'm still gonna go.
Mnca : See you later, babe.
Fbob : Public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
Phoe : See you.
Phoe : Fun Bobby is so great.
Mnca : Oh, isn't he?
UNK: I think this time it may work with him. He makes me feel so good.
UNK: I've been feeling so lousy lately. No job, no boyfriend.
Mnca : Well, at least my cup is half full.
UNK: Half full of love!
Mnca : For our two-week anniversary, he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.
UNK: Cabin of love!
Rach : We went through a lot of wine tonight.
Mnca : I only had two glasses.
UNK: I had a glass.
UNK: Two.
Rach : I had one glass.
UNK: I had a mug full in this...
UNK: ...I-got-boned-at-the- Museum-of-Natural-History mug.
UNK: Okay, so that's what? Two bottles.
Rach : And yet somehow we went through five?
Fbob : So what? So he drank a lot tonight.
Ross : Now that I think about it, I don't think...
Ross : ...I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a drink.
UNK: And did you notice how he always starts his stories with...
UNK: ..."Okay, I was so wasted!" Or "Oh, we were so bombed!"
UNK: "So I wake up and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut!"
UNK: Have you been with him when he wasn't drinking?
UNK: We just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink.
UNK: How do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink?
Mnca : Or to a club, or to the...
UNK: ...zoo.
Mnca : Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
UNK: I don't know, taste it.
UNK: Too late, you already had some.
UNK: What do you say we make these coffees Irish?
UNK: Cake!
UNK: Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.
Mnca : It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff "Irish" lately.
Fbob : I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
UNK: Yeah, okay.
UNK: Maybe it's none of my business. Or maybe it is, I don't know.
UNK: I'm worried about you.
Fbob : This isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.
UNK: But I always made excuses, like "I'm just a social drinker."
UNK: Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"
Mnca : So, what are you saying now?
Fbob : I guess I'm saying...
Fbob : ...I'll try and quit.
UNK: I like that you worry about me.
UNK: So, what's going on?
Fbob : I am gonna try and quit drinking.
UNK: Oh! Why?
UNK: Guess who's back in show biz!
UNK: Lorne Greene?
UNK: No. You know why? Because he's dead.
Phoe : Oh, no.
UNK: This is gonna seem bittersweet now...
Chan : ...but Joey, that's who!
UNK: My agent called with an audition for Days Of Our Lives!
UNK: Kick ass!
Phoe : We have to celebrate! We should do a soap opera theme.
Chan : We could all sleep together, then one of us could get amnesia!
UNK: When do you get off? We'll do something tonight.
Rach : Well, actually, I'm already done. But I kind of got plans.
Mnca : You have other friends?
Rach : I have a date.
UNK: What?
Joey : With a man?
UNK: No, with Crule John.
UNK: What's so strange about me having a date?
UNK: With Crule John.
Joey : What about Ross?
UNK: You're still mad because he made that list?
UNK: No, no, I'm not mad at him.
UNK: I'm not really "anything" at him anymore.
Mnca : - What are you talking about? - I don't know.
Rach : Whatever I was feeling, I'm...
UNK: ...not.
Phoe : But you guys came so close.
UNK: I'm sorry. You'll have to get used to the fact...
Rach : ...that I will not be dating Ross.
Rach : Here he is.
Rach : Guys, this is Russ.
