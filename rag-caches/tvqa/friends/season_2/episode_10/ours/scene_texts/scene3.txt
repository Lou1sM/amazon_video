UNK: I'm not saying you're not talented. You're very talented.
UNK: But with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.
UNK: Honey, give me a break, will you?
Estl : I'll talk to you later.
Estl : There's my favorite client!
Estl : So tell me, darling, how was the audition?
UNK: I think it went well. I got a callback for Thursday.
Estl : Joey! Have you ever seen me ecstatic?
Estl : Well, here it is.
UNK: Okay! Listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Joey : The casting lady
Estl : Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Joey : She's great.
UNK: But I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.
Joey : And I definitely would get the part if I were to, you know...
UNK: If I sent the little general in.
Estl : I see! Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here...
UNK: ...and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.
Estl : Lori, please.
Estl : Hi, darling!
UNK: How about Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver?
Estl : Isn't he terrific?
UNK: Okay, doll, talk to you later.
Estl : You're gonna have to sleep with her.
Rach : - What's the matter? - Fun Bobby.
