Rach : What? Isn't he sober?
UNK: Oh, he's sober all right.
Mnca : Turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
UNK: All right, here you go, sweetie.
Fbob : Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Mnca : Oh, God, yes!
Fbob : There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Phoe : That is funny.
UNK: I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out walking around the neighborhood.
UNK: And I am walking, and I am walking, and I am walking
UNK: So you are saying you are walking
Fbob : But apparently...
Fbob : ...there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
UNK: So it's help for fat...
UNK: ...as well as funny.
Mnca : Don't you have to be at your interview?
Phoe : Oh, yeah.
Fbob : See you guys.
UNK: Bye...
Chan : ...ridiculously dull Bobby.
Mnca : Oh, my God.
UNK: He's not that bad.
Phoe : Not that bad? Did you not hear the hammer story?
UNK: Okay, don't get all squinky.
UNK: Maybe it's the kind of story where you had to be there.
Mnca : But I'm gonna be there!
Mnca : For the rest of my life.
UNK: I can't dump him. I made him quit drinking. I made him dull!
Phoe : Don't say that.
Phoe : He's probably always been dull. You just, you know...
Phoe : ...set it free.
Chan : Hey, Ross.
Rach : Hi, Russ.
UNK: I've got two more tables to clean, and then we'll go.
Russ : I'll just sit here and...
Russ : ...chat with your...
UNK: ...friend-type people.
UNK: Rachel?
Phoe : So, you know what you're doing, right?
UNK: Waitressing?
Phoe : Well, yeah. But, no. I mean...
Phoe : Doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Rach : Bob Saget?
Phoe : Oh, yeah!
Joey : No, no, no!
Phoe : Oh, my, oh!
Ross : What's wrong?
UNK: She's upset because...
Mnca : ...she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
UNK: All right.
UNK: Listen, Pheebs. This is gonna be okay.
Chan : Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Russ : Are you a friend of Rachel's?
Ross : Yes. Yes, I am.
Russ : Are you a friend of Rachel's?
UNK: Actually, I'm kind of a...
Phoe : ...you know...
Russ : ...a date-type thing...
Russ : ...of Rachel's.
Rach : A date?
Russ : I'm her date.
UNK: Oh! Oh, you're a...
Ross : Oh, you're the date.
Chan : This is actually good...
UNK: ...because if we lose Ross, we have a spare.
Russ : Oh! You are the paleontologist.
Ross : Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a...
UNK: Periodontist.
UNK: See? Now they're as different as night and...
Mnca : ...later that night.
Ross : Well, I am going to get a beverage.
UNK: It was nice meeting you.
UNK: Ditto.
UNK: Well, I met Russ.
Ross : Hey, I didn't know we were seeing other people.
Rach : Well, we're not seeing each other, so...
Ross : For your information, there's a woman at the museum...
Ross : ...who's curator of moths and other...
Ross : ...winged things...
Ross : ...who's let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a...
Phoe : ...you know.
UNK: I've kept her at bay, but if this is the deal
Ross : This is the deal.
UNK: Okay, well, have a nice evening.
Rach : Russ, you ready?
Ross : She's dating?
Ross : She's dating?
Chan : Yes, but did you see who she was dating?
Ross : What do you mean?
Mnca : - Do you not see it? - See what?
Ross : I don't know what she sees in that goober!
Ross : It takes him, what? Like, I don't know...
Ross : ...hello, a week to get out a sentence?
Chan : It's annoying, isn't it?
Chan : You didn't get the part...
Chan : ...or Italy called and said it was hungry?
Joey : The part's mine if I want it.
Mnca : Oh, my God!
Joey : If I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Mnca : Oh, my...
UNK: ...God?
Joey : Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this. Ten years!
Joey : I mean, Days of our Lives. That's actually on television!
Chan : What are you gonna do?
Joey : I guess I could sleep with her. I mean...
UNK: How can I do that?
Chan : I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
