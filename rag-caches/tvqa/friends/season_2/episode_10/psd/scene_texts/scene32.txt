UNK: Did Joey say what he was gonna do?
Chan : I don't even think he knew.
Chan : Would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
Rach : Who would I have to sleep with?
UNK: Me.
UNK: Why with you?
Chan : It's my game. You want the job or not?
UNK: Good morning.
UNK: Where you going?
Mnca : Bobby and I are going away for the weekend. Remember?
UNK: What's with all the liquor?
Ross : What's going on? Is Bobby drinking again?
Mnca : This is not for him. This is for me.
UNK: That way, he's sober but his shoelace stories are more amusing.
Rach : God! Even his knock is boring!
UNK: - I'll be ready in a second. - Could I talk to you?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: This is hard for me to say.
Mnca : You fell off the wagon!
Mnca : Oh, no, no.
Fbob : It's about you.
Mnca : What about me?
Fbob : I think you may have a drinking problem.
Mnca : What, these?
UNK: No, these are for cuts and scrapes.
UNK: Look, I'm not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship.
