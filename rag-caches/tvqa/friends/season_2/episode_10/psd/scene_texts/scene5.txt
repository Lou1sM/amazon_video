Joey : - Maybe. - Don't toy with me.
UNK: Geller!
Ross : Hey, Fun Bobby!
UNK: Hey! You been working out?
Ross : Not at all.
Ross : I love this guy!
UNK: I'm so excited to hear you're back with my sister.
Mnca : - You and me both! - So what'd I miss?
UNK: We were trying to make Joey feel better.
Fbob : Need me to pick you up?
UNK: No, I'm all right, man.
Fbob : No, I'm picking you up!
Joey : No, seriously. I don't need you to
Joey : It still works!
Fbob : Before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?
Fbob : I'm still gonna go.
Mnca : See you later, babe.
Fbob : Public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
Phoe : See you.
Phoe : Fun Bobby is so great.
Mnca : Oh, isn't he?
UNK: I think this time it may work with him. He makes me feel so good.
UNK: I've been feeling so lousy lately. No job, no boyfriend.
