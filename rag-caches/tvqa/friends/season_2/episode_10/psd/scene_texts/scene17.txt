Joey : The casting lady
Estl : Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Joey : She's great.
UNK: But I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.
Joey : And I definitely would get the part if I were to, you know...
UNK: If I sent the little general in.
Estl : I see! Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here...
UNK: ...and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.
Estl : Lori, please.
Estl : Hi, darling!
UNK: How about Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver?
Estl : Isn't he terrific?
