Mnca : Don't you have to be at your interview?
Phoe : Oh, yeah.
Fbob : See you guys.
UNK: Bye...
Chan : ...ridiculously dull Bobby.
Mnca : Oh, my God.
UNK: He's not that bad.
Phoe : Not that bad? Did you not hear the hammer story?
UNK: Okay, don't get all squinky.
UNK: Maybe it's the kind of story where you had to be there.
Mnca : But I'm gonna be there!
Mnca : For the rest of my life.
UNK: I can't dump him. I made him quit drinking. I made him dull!
Phoe : Don't say that.
Phoe : He's probably always been dull. You just, you know...
Phoe : ...set it free.
Chan : Hey, Ross.
Rach : Hi, Russ.
UNK: I've got two more tables to clean, and then we'll go.
Russ : I'll just sit here and...
Russ : ...chat with your...
UNK: ...friend-type people.
UNK: Rachel?
Phoe : So, you know what you're doing, right?
UNK: Waitressing?
Phoe : Well, yeah. But, no. I mean...
Phoe : Doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Rach : Bob Saget?
Phoe : Oh, yeah!
Joey : No, no, no!
Phoe : Oh, my, oh!
Ross : What's wrong?
UNK: She's upset because...
Mnca : ...she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
UNK: All right.
UNK: Listen, Pheebs. This is gonna be okay.
Chan : Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Russ : Are you a friend of Rachel's?
Ross : Yes. Yes, I am.
Russ : Are you a friend of Rachel's?
