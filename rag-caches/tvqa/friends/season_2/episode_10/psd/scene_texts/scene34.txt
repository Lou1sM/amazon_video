Joey : It was unbelievable. I walked in there and she was all over me.
UNK: - What did you do? - I couldn't do it.
UNK: I didn't want the part that way.
Ross : Good for you!
Joey : But wait! I left her office...
UNK: ...and she caught up with me and offered me a bigger part.

UNK: So, you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...
Joey : ...recurring in at least four episodes!
UNK: All right, I gotta go shower.
