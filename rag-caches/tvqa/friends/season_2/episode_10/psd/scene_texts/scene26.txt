Chan : What are you gonna do?
Joey : I guess I could sleep with her. I mean...
UNK: How can I do that?
Chan : I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
Joey : I've never slept with someone for a part.
Chan : Well, is she
UNK: Sorry.
Chan : Is she good-looking?
UNK: She's totally good-looking. If I met her in a bar...
Joey : ...I'd be buying her breakfast.
Joey : After having slept with her.
Chan : Maybe this isn't such a big deal.
Chan : The way that I see it is, you get a great job, and you get to have sex!
Chan : Throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got Christmas!
