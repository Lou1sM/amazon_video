Rachel : Ross kissed me.
Monica : Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Rachel : It was unbelievable!
Monica : Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
UNK: Let's hear everything.
Phoebe : Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone.
Phoebe : Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Rachel : It ended very well.
Monica : Do not start without me! Do not start without me!
UNK: Okay. All right. Let's hear about the kiss.
UNK: Was it a soft brush against your lips...
UNK: ...or was it a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
