Rachel : Ross kissed me.
Monica : Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Rachel : It was unbelievable!
Monica : Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
UNK: Let's hear everything.
Phoebe : Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone.
Phoebe : Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Rachel : It ended very well.
Monica : Do not start without me! Do not start without me!
UNK: Okay. All right. Let's hear about the kiss.
UNK: Was it a soft brush against your lips...
UNK: ...or was it a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Rachel : Well, at first it was really intense, you know? And then...
Rachel : Oh, God. And then we just sort of sunk into it.
UNK: So was he holding you? Or were his hands on your back?
Rachel : No, actually, first they started out on my waist...
Rachel : ...and then they slid up and were in my hair.
UNK: And...
Ross : ...then I kissed her.
UNK: Tongue?
Ross : - Yeah. - Cool.
