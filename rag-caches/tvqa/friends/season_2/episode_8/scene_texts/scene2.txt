Chandler : I know. This must be so hard. "Oh, no! Two women love me!
Chandler : They're both gorgeous, my wallet's too small for my 50s...
UNK: ...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"
Joey : - Here's a thought - Don't ever touch the computer.
Joey : Ross, listen. I got two words for you :
UNK: Threesome.
UNK: You still have another word if you wanna use it.
UNK: Hey, I think I know what is it, HELP!
Chandler : Let's get logical about this. We'll make a list.
UNK: "Rachel and Julie : Pros and Cons."
Chandler : We'll put their names in different fonts...
Chandler : ...and I can use different colors for each column.
UNK: Can't we use a pen?
Chandler : No, Amish boy.
Joey : Let's start with the cons because they're more fun.
Joey : Rachel first.
Ross : I don't know.
Ross : I mean...
Ross : All right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Joey : You could say that.
UNK: I guess, sometimes she's a little ditzy, you know?
Ross : And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.
UNK: And Julie and I have a lot in common...
UNK: ...because we're both paleontologists, right?
Ross : But Rachel's just a waitress.
UNK: Waitress.
Chandler : Got it. You guys want to play Doom?
Chandler : Or we could keep doing this.
Chandler : What else?
Ross : I don't know.
Joey : Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.
UNK: Okay, let's do Julie.
Chandler : What's wrong with her?
Ross : She's not Rachel.
Monica : This is pumpkin pie with a Macholate crust.
