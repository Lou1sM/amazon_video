UNK: Mrs Buffay : Oh, my God. What the hell happened to my dog?
Phoebe : It was an accident.
Phoebe : And the woman who did this would never hurt a dog on purpose.
Phoebe : She's a vegetarian.
UNK: Mrs Buffay : Are these stitches?
Phoebe : Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him.
Phoebe : If it's raining, you can't let him look up...
UNK: ...because that cone will fill up fast.
UNK: Mrs Buffay : Thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Phoebe : - Is Frank home? - How do you know Frank?
UNK: Just from a long time ago. Is he here?
UNK: What?
Phoebe : I mean Frank Senior.
UNK: Mrs Buffay : He went out for groceries.
Phoebe : Will he be back soon?
UNK: Mrs Buffay : He left four years ago. We're expecting him back any minute.
Phoebe : I'm gonna go.
Phoebe : I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.
