UNK: Let's do this already.
UNK: You got a weapon?
UNK: Little Bully : A nice watch. I don't want to break it on your ribs.
UNK: All right, let's do this.
Question : If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
UNK: - What do you mean? - It's sharp, it's metal.
Chandler : I think I can do some serious damage with it.
UNK: Big Bully : No, you can't use your watch.
UNK: Big Bully : Or your keys.
UNK: Little Bully : Here's what we'll do.
UNK: Little Bully : We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there.
UNK: All right?
UNK: All right, come on, man. Let's do it!
Ross : Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
UNK: Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?
Ross : I have to work on Monday. I have a big presentation.
UNK: Actually, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow...
UNK: ...and this no-faces thing might not be a bad idea.
