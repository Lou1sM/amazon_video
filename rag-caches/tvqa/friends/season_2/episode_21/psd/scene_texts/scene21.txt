Rachel : How's the dog?
UNK: Okay. I talked to the vet. People are so nice upstate.
UNK: He said the little fella's gonna be okay, and I can get him tomorrow.
Joey : - Good. - Thank God.
Phoebe : But he did have to have a bunch of stitches.
Phoebe : And he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back.
UNK: So still hoping.
UNK: Now are you going to call your dad to let him know that his dog is okay?
