Joey : - Hey. - What?
Chandler : Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent...
UNK: ...to get to wear those cool jackets?
Ross : Do you say this stuff to girls?
UNK: Big Bully : Isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
UNK: Little Bully : And look where they're sitting.
Ross : You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
UNK: Big Bully : Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
UNK: Big Bully : This couch belongs to us.
Chandler : I'll tell you what, you call the couch...
Chandler : ...and then we'll call the couch...
Chandler : ...and we'll see who it comes to.
UNK: You know what I don't like you. You always got something to say.
UNK: You know, I keep wondering why you two are still sitting here.
UNK: All right, that's it.
UNK: I have had enough of this.
UNK: Gunther.
Ross : These guys are trying to take our seat.
Gunther : Fellas, these guys were here first.
UNK: Oh, sorry, didn't realize.
Gunther : There you go.
Ross : Thank you, Gunther.
Ross : We didn't want to have to go and do that.
UNK: Little Bully : He told on us?
UNK: Big Bully : You told on us?
