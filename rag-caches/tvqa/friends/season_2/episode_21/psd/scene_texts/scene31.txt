UNK: But you know what's cool? If you had a friend named Pete, I could say...
UNK: ..."I know Pete. He's friends with my brother."
UNK: - I got a friend named Mark. - That'll work too.
UNK: Cool. All right.
UNK: So maybe, you know, I could give you a call sometime.
UNK: We could talk or something.
UNK: - Yeah, that'd be okay. - All right.
Phoebe : I'm in the book.
