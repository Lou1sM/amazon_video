Phoebe : What was that?
Joey : I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
UNK: I want to buy five shares of SGJ. Now.
UNK: Come on, time is money, my friend!
Ross : Thank you!
UNK: "Time is money, my friend?"
UNK: You missed "Takes money to make money"...
UNK: ...and "Don't make me come down there and kick your Wall Street butt."
UNK: I made $ 17 before breakfast. What have you done?
Joey : I had breakfast here, so technically I saved $3.50.
Rachel : How did you make $17?
Monica : Well, my financially challenged friends...
Monica : ...I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
Joey : How come those?
Monica : Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.
UNK: And ZXY because I think it sounds "zexy."
Rachel : What happened to MEG?
Monica : MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.
UNK: My motto is, "Get out before they go down."
Joey : That is so not my motto.
Rachel : How's the dog?
UNK: Okay. I talked to the vet. People are so nice upstate.
UNK: He said the little fella's gonna be okay, and I can get him tomorrow.
Joey : - Good. - Thank God.
Phoebe : But he did have to have a bunch of stitches.
Phoebe : And he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back.
UNK: So still hoping.
UNK: Now are you going to call your dad to let him know that his dog is okay?
UNK: I don't want to meet my father over the phone.
UNK: What will I say, "Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.
UNK: Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."
UNK: Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Phoebe : Listen, just don't say anything about me, okay?
UNK: Don't...
Monica : ...be too long with the phone.
Rachel : She'll be a much better friend once the market closes.
Joey : It's a woman.
Phoebe : So talk to her.
UNK: Hello, Mrs. Buffay.
Joey : I know where your dog is.
UNK: I want you to know he'll be returned to you almost as good as new...
Joey : ...within 24 hours.
UNK: Goodbye.
Rachel : - Why the voice? - Hard to say.
UNK: Your cappuccino, sir.
Ross : Thank you.
UNK: - This is better than the coffeehouse. - Absolutely.
Ross : How come it's not mixing with the water?
UNK: The package says to keep it moving.
Chandler : Stir and drink, never let it settle.
Joey : This is ridiculous.
Joey : After I get back from my niece's christening...
UNK: ...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you and we'll have a cup of coffee.
Joey : No problem. Joey's there.
UNK: I don't want to have to have Joey with me every time I want decent coffee.
UNK: And I don't want to drink cappuccino with a "k."
Ross : I say you and I go and stand up to those guys.
UNK: All right, hang on a second there, Custer.
Joey : Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Ross : Yeah, sure.
Joey : By someone besides Monica?
Ross : So what?
UNK: So we get beaten up. Maybe that's something a man has to go through.
UNK: Like a rite of passage or something.
Chandler : Couldn't we just lose our virginities again?
Chandler : Because I think actually mine's growing back.
UNK: Are you go with me or not. Come on.
UNK: All right, I'm go with you. Just prepare clean underware for the hospital.
UNK: - I need $100. - What?
Monica : Welcome home.
UNK: - I need $100. - For what?
UNK: - To get back in the game. - When did you get out?
UNK: I lost it all. I lost it.
Monica : I've come to terms with it, you have to, too.
UNK: Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.
UNK: Where are we on the $100?
Rachel : I don't have it.
Monica : But I need it!
UNK: Otherwise, I'll have to take that diner job.
Monica : You know, with the dancing and the costumes.
UNK: I don't want to have to wear flame-retardant boobs.
Rachel : Nobody does, honey.
UNK: Noodle!
UNK: Mrs Buffay : Oh, my God. What the hell happened to my dog?
Phoebe : It was an accident.
Phoebe : And the woman who did this would never hurt a dog on purpose.
Phoebe : She's a vegetarian.
UNK: Mrs Buffay : Are these stitches?
Phoebe : Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him.
Phoebe : If it's raining, you can't let him look up...
UNK: ...because that cone will fill up fast.
UNK: Mrs Buffay : Thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Phoebe : - Is Frank home? - How do you know Frank?
UNK: Just from a long time ago. Is he here?
UNK: What?
Phoebe : I mean Frank Senior.
UNK: Mrs Buffay : He went out for groceries.
Phoebe : Will he be back soon?
UNK: Mrs Buffay : He left four years ago. We're expecting him back any minute.
Phoebe : I'm gonna go.
Phoebe : I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.
Phoebe : I'm sorry.
Frank : Hey, lady!
Frank : Hey, wait up!
Frank : - How do you know my dad? - Well, I don't really.
Phoebe : Just genetically.
UNK: He's kind of my dad too.
UNK: Heavy.
Phoebe : So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?
Frank : No, but he didn't really talk about anything.
Frank : Except stilts.
Frank : - Stilts? - Yeah, he loved stilts.
UNK: One time, I was upstairs stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse...
Frank : ...and all of a sudden I look over...
UNK: ...and there's Dad's head, bobbing past the window.
Frank : He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving...
UNK: ...because he was happiest when he was on his stilts.
Phoebe : I don't know what to do with that.
Frank : Me neither.
UNK: So are you, like, my big sister?
Frank : This is huge. You can buy me beer!
Phoebe : I'm not gonna.
UNK: But you know what's cool? If you had a friend named Pete, I could say...
UNK: ..."I know Pete. He's friends with my brother."
UNK: - I got a friend named Mark. - That'll work too.
UNK: Cool. All right.
UNK: So maybe, you know, I could give you a call sometime.
UNK: We could talk or something.
UNK: - Yeah, that'd be okay. - All right.
Phoebe : I'm in the book.
Phoebe : So stilts, huh?
UNK: If you want, I can show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Ross : We did it. We're here. We are standing our ground.
UNK: - How long does coffee take? - Would you come on? Come on!
Ross : Thank you.
Chandler : - There we go. - I think we proved our point.
Chandler : - You burn your mouth? - Cannot feel my tongue.
Chandler : Bullies! Big bullies!
UNK: Little Bully : Look who's here. It's the weenies.
UNK: Big Bully : Did we not make ourselves clear the other day?
Ross : That's why we're here.
UNK: Yes, we're standing our ground.
UNK: Apparently.
UNK: Let's do this already.
UNK: You got a weapon?
UNK: Little Bully : A nice watch. I don't want to break it on your ribs.
UNK: All right, let's do this.
Question : If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
UNK: - What do you mean? - It's sharp, it's metal.
Chandler : I think I can do some serious damage with it.
UNK: Big Bully : No, you can't use your watch.
UNK: Big Bully : Or your keys.
UNK: Little Bully : Here's what we'll do.
UNK: Little Bully : We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there.
UNK: All right?
UNK: All right, come on, man. Let's do it!
Ross : Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
UNK: Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?
Ross : I have to work on Monday. I have a big presentation.
UNK: Actually, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow...
UNK: ...and this no-faces thing might not be a bad idea.
UNK: Big Bully : Nothing from the neck up.
UNK: Big Bully : Or the waist down.
UNK: Big Bully : - Dana's ovulating. - Really? You guys trying again?
UNK: Let me get this straight. We're talking about the middle?
Ross : Come on!
Ross : You want a piece of this? I'm standing here!
UNK: Those guys are taking our stuff!
UNK: God, that was amazing. That was incredible.
Ross : - You guys kicked butt! - Us? What about you guys?
UNK: You really gave it to old Mr. Clean back there.
UNK: Little Bully : - He was a big guy. - Yeah, he was, wasn't he?
Chandler : I wouldn't know, having missed everything.
UNK: Big Bully : Don't do that to yourself.
UNK: Big Bully : Any one of us could have tripped over that little girl's jump rope.
Ross : So listen, guys...
UNK: ...are we okay here?
UNK: We're okay.
Chandler : So can I have my hat back?
UNK: Oh, my God. Look at her.
Chandler : Hi, Monica!
UNK: How's it going?
Phoebe : Hey, nice boobs.
Chandler : Guys, guys. Check this out.
UNK: Excellent.
