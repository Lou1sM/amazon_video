UNK: Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.
Phoebe : Yeah, I don't know.
Rachel : What's the matter?
Phoebe : I just think that this was a really bad sign.
Phoebe : Like the beast at the threshold.
UNK: It's just I have no family left, except for my grandmother.
Phoebe : But let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever.
Phoebe : Despite what she says.
Phoebe : And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.
Phoebe : I don't know. This is my real father...
UNK: ...and I want things to be, like, just right.
Rachel : I completely understand.
Joey : Whatever you need.
UNK: Hey, you want to go home?
UNK: Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.
