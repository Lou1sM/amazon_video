UNK: Why are we watching the Business Channel?
UNK: Because the other day I saw there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.
UNK: Sometimes it takes two or three hours before it comes up again.
UNK: But when it does, it's exciting.
UNK: Okay, honey, you really need a job.
Ross : Dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
UNK: Right there! That's the third sign today. Right there.
Ross : On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say, "Huh?"
UNK: No, you just said "dad." And everywhere I go today...
Phoebe : ...I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father.
Phoebe : Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet.
Phoebe : Which is my father's last name.
Phoebe : And they were serving franks...
Phoebe : ...which is his first name minus the "s" at the end.
Phoebe : And there was a rotisserie with a spinning chicken.
Monica : His Indian name?
Phoebe : No. Because I chickened out the last time...
Phoebe : ...when I tried to meet him. So coincidences? I don't think so.
UNK: - Very freaky. - Eerie.
Rachel : Who wants the last hamburger?
Phoebe : That's it. Now I have to go see him.
UNK: Why?
Phoebe : Hamburger? McDonald's?
UNK: Old McDonald had a farm. My dad is a pharmacist.
UNK: And ei ei oh, It's what your mom said when you father left you.
UNK: Yes! Really? No!
UNK: The One With the Bullies
Chandler : Man, I am so beat.
UNK: You wanna forget racquetball and hang out?
UNK: Yeah, all right.
UNK: Big Bully : - Hey, you're in our seats. - Sorry, we didn't know.
UNK: Little Bully : We were sitting there.
UNK: Okay. There is one more way to say it.
Chandler : Who knows it?
UNK: - Was that supposed to be funny? - Actually, I was going for colorful.
UNK: Big Bully : - What's with this guy? - What's with you?
Ross : Nothing. Nothing's with him.
Ross : Enjoy your coffee.
Chandler : What just happened?
UNK: Little Bully : I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too.
UNK: My joke is that I took your hat.
Chandler : That is funny.
Chandler : Can I have it back?
Ross : You know what? I think you're very funny.
Ross : Kudos on that hat joke.
UNK: But come on, guys, just give him back the hat.
UNK: Big Bully : Why should we?
Ross : Because it's a special hat.
UNK: He bought it because he was feeling down one day.
Ross : So he got the hat...
UNK: ...to cheer himself up, you know?
UNK: [scene : - Chandler - Stop talking. Stop talking now.
UNK: Let me get this straight. You're stealing my hat?
UNK: Big Bully : You got a problem?
UNK: I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
UNK: I'm telling you Rach, I've gone dead hunting with Phabby before.
UNK: It's a very scary thing for her, and she is very vunlerable.
UNK: That's why we are there. You know, be supported or crap.
UNK: Ok, will you just let me know when to do witch.
Rachel : How'd the interview go?
Monica : It bit.
UNK: It was a 50s theme restaurant.
UNK: I'd have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter.
UNK: I was a sous chef at Cafe des Artistes.
UNK: How can I take a job where I have to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?
Rachel : - Don't do it. - How can I not do it?
Monica : I have $127 in the bank!
Joey : Monica, relax. Go get a beer.
Monica : I don't want a beer.
Joey : Who said it was for you?
Rachel : What's the matter?
UNK: Some mean guys at the coffeehouse took my hat.
Joey : - No! - You're kidding?
Ross : It was ridiculous. These guys were bullies.
Ross : Actual bullies.
UNK: We're grownups. This kind of stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Chandler : Oh, no, wait a minute. I have no one.
Joey : Let's go down there and get your hat back.
Chandler : Forget it. It's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Monica : - I went up! - What?
UNK: My stock, MEG, it went up two points.
UNK: Do you realize that if I'd invested my $127 in myself yesterday...
Monica : ...that I'd, like, have a lot more than that today.
Ross : You know what? I'm going to do it.
Joey : - Do what? - Put all my money in me.
UNK: You don't know a thing about the stock market.
Monica : What's to know? Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.
Monica : Yes, Manhattan.
UNK: Telephone number for the stock...
Monica : ...selling store.
