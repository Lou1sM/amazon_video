Joey : - Hey. - What?
Chandler : Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent...
UNK: ...to get to wear those cool jackets?
Ross : Do you say this stuff to girls?
UNK: Big Bully : Isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
UNK: Little Bully : And look where they're sitting.
Ross : You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
UNK: Big Bully : Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
UNK: Big Bully : This couch belongs to us.
Chandler : I'll tell you what, you call the couch...
Chandler : ...and then we'll call the couch...
Chandler : ...and we'll see who it comes to.
UNK: You know what I don't like you. You always got something to say.
UNK: You know, I keep wondering why you two are still sitting here.
UNK: All right, that's it.
UNK: I have had enough of this.
UNK: Gunther.
Ross : These guys are trying to take our seat.
Gunther : Fellas, these guys were here first.
UNK: Oh, sorry, didn't realize.
Gunther : There you go.
Ross : Thank you, Gunther.
Ross : We didn't want to have to go and do that.
UNK: Little Bully : He told on us?
UNK: Big Bully : You told on us?
Ross : Well, pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Chandler : - Don't play with his thing. - I know.
UNK: All right.
UNK: Big Bully : Let's take this outside.
UNK: "Let's take this outside?"
Ross : Who talks like that?
UNK: The guy who's about to kick your ass talks like that.
Chandler : You had to ask.
UNK: Okay, okay, look. See...
UNK: ...the thing is, we're not gonna fight you guys.
UNK: Little Bully : Here's the deal.
UNK: You won't have to, so long as you never ever show your faces here again.
Chandler : I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
