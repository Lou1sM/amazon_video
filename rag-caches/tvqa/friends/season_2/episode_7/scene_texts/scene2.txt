Chandler : She's insane!
Chandler : The woman is insane.
UNK: It's before work, after work, and during work.
Chandler : She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
Chandler : And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
UNK: Just tell her you want to stop.
UNK: I can't. All she get to work is all she can got.
UNK: So that's why I was thinking, maybe we could all pitch in and buy her own restraunt.
Rachel : Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott?
Phoebe : It was nice. Took him to a romantic restaurant...
Phoebe : ...ordered champagne. Nice.
UNK: He still won't put out?
UNK: Nope. Zilch. Nothing.
All : Sorry, Pheebs.
UNK: Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
Phoebe : I like him a lot.
Phoebe : He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Phoebe : Why won't he give it up?
UNK: Maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road.
UNK: If you know what I mean.
UNK: No. What do you mean? He's not British.
UNK: Maybe he's gay.
Phoebe : I don't think that's the problem.
Phoebe : We went dancing the other night...
UNK: ...and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes...
UNK: I just definitely felt something.
Rachel : But how much can you tell from a look?
Phoebe : I felt it on my hip. I could tell.
