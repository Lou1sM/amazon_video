Phoebe : It was nice. Took him to a romantic restaurant...
Phoebe : ...ordered champagne. Nice.
UNK: He still won't put out?
UNK: Nope. Zilch. Nothing.
All : Sorry, Pheebs.
UNK: Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
Phoebe : I like him a lot.
Phoebe : He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Phoebe : Why won't he give it up?
