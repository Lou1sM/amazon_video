Chandler : I don't mind the last pound.
Chandler : In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
Chandler : So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
UNK: What you gonna do, fat boy?
UNK: What?
UNK: Nothing. Except tell you it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Monica : Well, thanks.
Chandler : Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Chandler : You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
Chandler : It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

UNK: If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
UNK: You know, I try to stay positive.
Chandler : So you...
UNK: You feel like going for a run?
