UNK: You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
Ross : I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
Ross : I was doing great before I knew about you!
Rachel : You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
UNK: You should've said something before!
Rachel : I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything?
Ross : There was never a good time.
Rachel : You only had a year. And we only hung out every night!
UNK: Not...
Rachel : ...every night.
Ross : It's not like I didn't try. But things got in the way.
UNK: You know, like Italian guys...
UNK: ...or ex-fiances...
Ross : ...or Italian guys.
Rachel : There was one Italian guy, okay? And do you have a point?
UNK: The point is, I don't need this right now!
UNK: Okay? It's too late.
Ross : I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed!
UNK: You're just gonna put away your feelings for me?
UNK: I've done it since ninth grade. I'm good at it.
Guy : All right, fine. You go ahead and do that.
UNK: I don't need your ship!
Rachel : - Good. - Good!
UNK: And you know what? Now I got closure!
