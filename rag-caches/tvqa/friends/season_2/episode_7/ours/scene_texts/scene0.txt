Chandler : What is it about me? Do I not look fun enough?
Chandler : Is there something repellent about me?
Rachel : How was the party?
Chandler : It couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me.
Chandler : What is it? Am I hideously unattractive?
Phoebe : No, you are not. You are very attractive.
UNK: I go through the same thing.
UNK: When I put on a little weight, I question everything.
UNK: I've put on weight?
UNK: Did you want to...?
Phoebe : No, not weight. More like insulation.
Monica : I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
Monica : Wanna work out? I can remake you.
Chandler : I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
UNK: Please?
UNK: Come on, let her do it!
Chandler : All right.
Chandler : If we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Phoebe : Your boobs are fine.
UNK: I shouldn't have said anything.
Phoebe : Come here. Come here!
Phoebe : Can't make hands meet!
