Rachel : We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
Michael : I don't know if Monica told you, but this my first date since my divorce.
Michael : If I seem a little nervous...
Michael : ...I am.
Rachel : How long do cats live?
Michael : I'm sorry?
Rachel : Cats. How long do they live?
UNK: Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
Michael : Maybe 15, 16 years.
UNK: Well, that's just great.
UNK: Cheers!
Rachel : Right. Clink.
Michael : Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
Rachel : No, Michael, it's not you. Sorry. It's just...
Rachel : It's this thing.
UNK: It's not as bad as it sounds...
Rachel : ...but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Michael : Oh, that does sound...
Rachel : He just started going out with her.
UNK: Is this guy an old boyfriend?
Rachel : Yeah, he wishes.
Rachel : I'm sorry. Look at me.
Rachel : Michael, let's talk about you.
UNK: So...
UNK: Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
Phoebe : - So I figured it out. - What?
Phoebe : Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
Phoebe : I'm not sexy enough.
Joey : Phoebe, that's crazy.
Joey : When I first met you, you know what I said?
Joey : I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Phoebe : Really? That's so sweet.
Phoebe : I mean, I'm officially offended. But that's so sweet.
UNK: If you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
Phoebe : You're right. You're right.
UNK: You are so "yum"!
UNK: I mean, it's a cat, you know? It's a cat.
UNK: Why can't they get a bug? One of those fruit flies.
UNK: Those things that live for a day.
Rachel : What are they called?
Rachel : Fruit flies?
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: Would you like dessert?
Michael : No dessert.
UNK: Just the check. Please.
UNK: Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?
Michael : No, no, I am.
UNK: But only because I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Rachel : Oh, look at me.
Rachel : Look at me.
Rachel : I'm on a date with a really great guy.
Rachel : All I can think about is Ross...
Rachel : ...and his cat...
Rachel : ...and his Julie.
UNK: Look, do you want a piece of pie or something?
UNK: Do like that man, I just screwed this all over.
Rachel : I just want to get over him. Why can't I do that?
Michael : Look, I've been through a divorce. Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
UNK: You can't see it because you haven't had closure
UNK: Closure!
Rachel : That's what it is! That's what I need!
Rachel : God, you're brilliant!
Rachel : Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
UNK: Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
Michael : Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him :
Michael : "I'm over you."
Michael : Over you.
Rachel : That's what it is.
UNK: Closure.
Rachel : Hello? Excuse me?
Rachel : Excuse me. Hel
Guy : - Hang on. - Excuse me?
Chandler : - What? - Hi. I'm sorry.
Rachel : I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
UNK: - I'm talking. - I see that.
Rachel : One phone call, I'll be very quick. I'll even pay for it myself.
UNK: You're being a little weird about your phone.
Guy : All right. Fine.
Guy : I'll call you back.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: So good people!
UNK: Machine.
Rachel : - Just waiting for the beep. - Good.
Rachel : Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.
Rachel : I'm just calling to say that...
Rachel : ...everything's fine.
Rachel : And I'm really happy for you...
Rachel : ...and your cat.
Rachel : Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
UNK: You see there, I'm thinking of names...
Rachel : ...so obviously I am over you.
Rachel : I am over you.
Rachel : And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
