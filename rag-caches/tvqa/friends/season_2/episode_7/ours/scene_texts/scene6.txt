UNK: Yeah. This one is cute, that one is cute. They are all cute, they're kittens!
UNK: Let's just wrap one and get the hell out of here.
UNK: - Are you OK! - Yeah, me, sure!
UNK: You know this is the big step for us, but I'm got feeling that will be OK.
UNK: I know, I know!
UNK: Do you have any cat really old and incrediblly sick.
UNK: Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.
UNK: Oh, see? We should have worked that out before we came down here.
UNK: OK, sweetie. I'm gonna narrow it down with this one over here and this one with the stripes, OK?
UNK: - I have to pick? - Whickever one you want.
UNK: I don't know. I mean it's not easy to choose.
UNK: You know both cat are beautiful, funny. You will be happy with either cat.
UNK: Do you want to take both?
UNK: I can't have two cats. Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.
Ross : I didn't get a cat.
Rachel : That's interesting.
UNK: No, it's not "interesting." It's very, very not interesting.
UNK: It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.
Rachel : I got it, Ross.
UNK: You had no right to say you had feelings for me.
Ross : I was doing great with Julie before I knew!
Ross : I was doing great before I knew about you!
Rachel : You think it's easy to see you with Julie?
UNK: You should've said something before!
Rachel : I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything?
Ross : There was never a good time.
Rachel : You only had a year. And we only hung out every night!
UNK: Not...
Rachel : ...every night.
Ross : It's not like I didn't try. But things got in the way.
UNK: You know, like Italian guys...
UNK: ...or ex-fiances...
Ross : ...or Italian guys.
Rachel : There was one Italian guy, okay? And do you have a point?
UNK: The point is, I don't need this right now!
UNK: Okay? It's too late.
Ross : I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed!
UNK: You're just gonna put away your feelings for me?
UNK: I've done it since ninth grade. I'm good at it.
Guy : All right, fine. You go ahead and do that.
UNK: I don't need your ship!
Rachel : - Good. - Good!
UNK: And you know what? Now I got closure!
Ross : Try the bottom one.
UNK: Monica, it's 6 : 30 in the morning.
UNK: We're not working out. It's over.
Monica : No way! With one pound to go? Come on!
Monica : We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
Chandler : I don't mind the last pound.
Chandler : In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
Chandler : So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
UNK: What you gonna do, fat boy?
UNK: What?
UNK: Nothing. Except tell you it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Monica : Well, thanks.
Chandler : Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Chandler : You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
Chandler : It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
UNK: Well, no. But I...
UNK: If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
UNK: You know, I try to stay positive.
Chandler : So you...
UNK: You feel like going for a run?
Chandler : All right.
UNK: Because you don't have to. You could just take a nap right here.
