Chandler : Why must everybody watch me sleep?
Chandler : There'll be no more watching me sleep! No more...
UNK: ...watching!
Eddie : I got some great stuff to dehydrate. Grapes, apricots.
UNK: I thought it'd be cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Chandler : Get out. Get out, get out, get out!
Chandler : - What? - You! Move out!
Chandler : Take your fruit! Your stupid small fruit and get out!
Eddie : You want me to move out?
UNK: I gotta tell you, that's kind of out of the blue, don't you think?
Chandler : This is not out of the blue!
UNK: This is smack-dab in the middle of the blue!
Eddie : Relax! Take it easy, buddy!
UNK: You don't have to tell me twice.
UNK: Someone will be by for my stuff.
UNK: If you think I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane!
Chandler : You want some help?
Eddie : No help required, chico!
Joey : All the way to the airport, huh? You know, that's over 30 miles.
Joey : That's gonna cost you about so bucks.
UNK: Excuse me, that's fifty bucks.
UNK: Five-O dollars.
Joey : You know what it is? It's smudgy because they're fax pages.
Joey : When I was on Days of our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray...
Joey : ...they'd send over the whole script on real paper.
UNK: Casting Guy : That's great.
Joey : If you wanted to expand this scene, like have the cab crash...
Joey : ...I could attend to the victims...
UNK: ...because I have a background in medical acting.
UNK: Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.
UNK: Don't thank me for coming in. At least let me finish.
Joey : We could take the expressway...
Joey : ...but this time of day you're better off taking the budge.
UNK: You were going for bridge there, weren't you?
Joey : I'll have a good day.
UNK: Honey, I know you didn't mean to.
UNK: Rach, hang up. You're supposed to be taking goddess quiz.
UNK: You should lose 100 point just because of you call your boyfriend in the middle of it.
Phoebe : Question number 28.
UNK: "Have you ever allowed a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"
Phoebe : I would have to say no.
Monica : And I would have to say...
UNK: What?
Monica : Do you not remember the puppet guy?
UNK: You totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Monica : And his puppet too!
Phoebe : Well, at least I didn't let some guy...
Phoebe : ...into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date!
Monica : - Who? - Paul!
Rachel : Moving on, moving on. Next question.
UNK: Okay, number 29.
UNK: "Have you ever betrayed another goddess...
UNK: ...for a lightning-bearer?" Okay, number 30.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's go back to 29.
Rachel : Not to my recollection.
UNK: Danny Arshack, ninth grade.
Monica : You know the bottle was pointing at me.
UNK: Only because you took up half the circle!
Phoebe : Listen to you two. It's so sad.
UNK: Looks like I'll be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Rachel : Not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley...
Rachel : ...an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Monica : One hour?
Monica : You are such a leaf blower!
UNK: - That is not on the book. - No, but that's what you are.
Joey : Be careful with that 3-D Last Supper. Judas is a little loose.
UNK: Oh, my God! What's going on?
UNK: They're taking all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
UNK: No, I wasn't right. That's what I came here to tell you.
Ross : I was totally hung up on my own stuff the other day.
UNK: No, listen. I need the whole security thing, you know?
UNK: To know where my next paycheck is coming from. But you don't need that.
Ross : And that's amazing to me.
Ross : I could never do what you do.
UNK: Casting Guy : - Thanks. - You hold out for something bigger.
Ross : I can't tell you how much respect I have...
Ross : ...for you not going to that stupid audition.
Joey : - I went. - Great! How did it go?
Joey : - I didn't get it. - Good for you!
UNK: You're living the dream!
Ross : All right, then!
Joey : Not my parrot.
Joey : I can't watch this.
Ross : Hey, hold on, hold on.
Ross : How much for the... How much to save the bird?
UNK: - Twelve hundred. - Dollars?
UNK: You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?
UNK: It was an impulse buy. Near the register.
Ross : Go ahead with the bird.
UNK: Do you have anything for around $200?
Mover : The dog.
Ross : I'll take it.
Ross : My gift to you, man.
Joey : Thanks, Ross!
UNK: I really liked that bird, though.
UNK: But the dog!
Rachel : Here are your cakes.
Monica : We didn't order cake.
Rachel : No, I know. They're from me.
Rachel : You guys, this is not good.
Rachel : We have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind...
Rachel : ...without taking it from each other.
Rachel : You're right.
Phoebe : I love you goddesses.
Phoebe : I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Rachel : - Thank you. So are we good? - We're good.
Monica : We're good?
UNK: Let me take these back. They'll take it out of my paycheck.
UNK: Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!
Monica : Are you sure this time?
Chandler : I actually saw him leave.
UNK: That guy is holding a human head.
UNK: He's holding a human head!
Eddie : Check it out, man!
UNK: I tore it off a mannequin in the alley behind Macy's.
UNK: There's no alley behind Macy's.
Eddie : So I got it in the junior miss department. Big diff.
UNK: It'll make a hell of a conversation piece at our next cocktail party.
UNK: "Our next cocktail party"?
UNK: We'll put chips in it. We'll make it a chip chick.
Chandler : Do you remember yesterday?
Eddie : Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Chandler : Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Chandler : So what happened?
Eddie : We took a road trip to Las Vegas!
Chandler : Oh, sweet Moses!
Monica : So on this road trip, did you win any money?
UNK: I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here! He cleans up!
UNK: $300! He buys me these new shoes.
UNK: Nice.
UNK: See you upstairs. See you, pals!
Phoebe : Is anyone else starting to really like him?
Chandler : May I help you?
Eddie : Why doesn't my key work, and what's my stuff doing downstairs?
Joey : I'm sorry.
Chandler : Have we met?
Eddie : It's Eddie, you freak! Your roommate.
Joey : I'm sorry...
Chandler : ...I already have a roommate.
Chandler : He's lived here for years. I don't know what you're talking about.
UNK: No, he moved out and I moved in.
UNK: Well, I think we'd remember something like that.
Joey : I know I would.
Eddie : That's a good point.
UNK: Okay, wow.
Eddie : I guess I got the wrong apartment.
UNK: - I'm terribly sorry. - Hey, no problem.
UNK: See you.
UNK: Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.
Chandler : - You want me to help you unpack? - Nah, I'm okay.
Joey : Just so you know, I'm not moving back in because I have to.
UNK: I mean, I do have to, but...
Joey : It's just that that place, it wasn't really...
Rachel : I mean, this is...
Chandler : Welcome home, man.
Joey : - A little foos? - Absolutely!
Joey : What happened to the foosball?
UNK: It's a cantaloupe.
UNK: Are we gonna bring this out every time Ross comes over?
Joey : He paid a lot of money for it.
Chandler : I'm gonna hold him a different way.
Chandler : If you hated it so much, why'd you buy it in the first place?
Joey : Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing going over there.
UNK: But without the other ones, it looks tacky.
UNK: Is he housetrained or will he leave little bathroom tiles all over?
UNK: Stay.
UNK: Stay!
Chandler : Good fake dog.
