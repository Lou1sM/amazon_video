Chandler : Hey, Eddie.
UNK: - What are you doing here? - Watching you sleep.
UNK: Why?
UNK: It makes me feel peaceful.
UNK: Please.
Chandler : I can't sleep now!
Eddie : You want me to sing?
UNK: That's it. I want you out of the apartment now!
UNK: What are you talking about?
Chandler : Hannibal Lecter?
Chandler : Better roommate than you.
UNK: I don't think you're being fair! One night you see me and you get scared.
UNK: What about the other nights when you don't see me?
UNK: Last night you went and got some water...
Eddie : ...and I was nice enough to hide behind the door.
Chandler : I didn't realize that.
Chandler : Get out now!
Eddie : You really want me out?
Chandler : Yes, please.
Eddie : Then I want to hear you say you want me out.
Chandler : I want you out.
UNK: I want to hear it from your lips.
UNK: Where'd you hear it before?
Eddie : All right. You know what? Consider me gone.
UNK: I will go to my brother's basement. When he find out, I will find another man's house.
Eddie : I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Rachel : - Thank you. - I heard that.
