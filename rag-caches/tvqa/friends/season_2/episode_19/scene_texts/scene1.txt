UNK: Well, look at you!
Rachel : Finally got that time machine working, huh?
Joey : You like it?
UNK: This guy was selling them on 8th Avenue and I thought...
UNK: ..."You know what I don't have?"
Monica : A mirror?
Joey : Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Monica : For a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in a good mood.
UNK: I'll be all right. I'm not starting from square one.
UNK: I was Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of our Lives.
UNK: That's got to have some kind of cachet.
UNK: Cachet? Jaunty?
Joey : Chandler gave me word-of-the-day toilet paper.
Joey : I'm gonna get some coffee.
UNK: Go on, you know you want to.
Phoebe : So? Did you read the book?
Monica : Oh, my God. It was incredible!
Phoebe : Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?
Rachel : What book is this?
Monica : You have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.
Monica : It's about how women need to become more empowered.
UNK: But there's wind.
Phoebe : And the wind can make us goddesses.
UNK: Do you know who takes our wind? Men. They just take it.
UNK: Men just take our wind?
UNK: All the time. Because they are the lightning-bearers.
UNK: That sounds kind of cool. It's like The Hobbit.
Monica : It is nothing like The Hobbit.
Monica : It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had.
Monica : Except for Richard.
Phoebe : Richard would never steal your wind.
UNK: Because he's yummy.
UNK: But all the others.
Phoebe : And the part about how they're always drinking...
UNK: ...from our pool of inner power.
Phoebe : But God forbid we should take a sip.
UNK: Anybody want a cruller?
Phoebe : This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.
Monica : It's like...
UNK: ..."Hello. Who wants one of my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"
