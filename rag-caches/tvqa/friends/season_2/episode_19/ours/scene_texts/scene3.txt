Joey : I'm sorry.
UNK: I'll see you.
UNK: God!
Rachel : Oh, God! I mean, it's just so...
Monica : Isn't it?
Rachel : This is like reading about my own life!
Rachel : This book could have been called Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!
UNK: It wouldn't have sold a million copies...
UNK: ...but it would've made a nice gift for you.
UNK: Sweetie, we've got to go.
Rachel : No! Why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?
UNK: Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.
UNK: It's so you don't miss the beginning.
UNK: This isn't about the movie theater. This is about you stealing my wind.
Monica : You go, girl!
Monica : I can't pull that off, can I?
UNK: Excuse me, your wind?
Rachel : Yes, my wind.
Rachel : How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
UNK: You know I don't...
Ross : ...have a problem with that.
Rachel : I just really need to be with myself right now.
Joey : I'm sorry.
Rachel : You're right. I don't have to apologize.
UNK: Sorry. Damn it!
Joey : - What is it? - I don't know.
Ross : It's got all this stuff about wind and trees...
UNK: ...and some sacred pool.
Ross : I don't really get it. But she's pretty upset about it.
Joey : This is why I don't date women who read.
Eddie : What's that?
Joey : It's my VISA bill.
Joey : Envelope one of two.
Joey : - That can't be good. - Open it, open it.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Joey : Look at this! How did I spend so much money?
UNK: That's just the minimum amount. That's your total.
UNK: Thirty-five hundred dollars at "Porcelain Safari"?
Joey : My animals.
Joey : The guy said they suited me. He spoke with an accent. I was confused.
UNK: I don't know what to do!
UNK: You can start by driving a cab on Another World.
Chandler : - What? - That audition?
UNK: That's a two-line part!
Ross : Joey, you owe $1100 at "I Love Lucite."
Joey : - So what? - So suck it up, man.
Ross : It's a job. It's money.
UNK: I don't need you getting judgmental and condescending and pedantic.
Joey : Toilet paper?
Ross : I'm not being any of those things. I'm being realistic.
Joey : You're supposed to be my friend!
Ross : I am your friend.
Joey : Then tell me things like, "You'll be fine."
UNK: And "Something big's gonna come along. I know it!"
Ross : But I don't know it.
UNK: What I do know is you owe $2300 at "Isn't It Chromantic?"
Joey : I'm aware of what I owe.
Ross : Then get some sense. It took you 10 years to get that job.
UNK: - How long till you get another? - I don't want to hear this!
Ross : I'm just saying...
UNK: Well, don't "just say"!
Ross : Maybe I should just go.
UNK: I'll see you later.
Ross : Just think about it.
Joey : I don't need to think about it!
UNK: I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
Joey : That was huge!
Joey : Big things are gonna happen! You'll see!
UNK: Ross!
Joey : You still there?
UNK: What are you still doing here?
Eddie : Just some basic dehydrating of fruits and vegetables.
Eddie : Man alive, this thing's fantastic!
Chandler : Aren't you forgetting anything?
UNK: Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.
UNK: He's feistier than the last one.
UNK: Maybe because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.
Chandler : Eddie, isn't there something you're supposed to be doing now?
Eddie : Not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating.
Eddie : Because right now, I'm a dehydrating maniac!
Chandler : I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time I got
Eddie : You know what that is?
Chandler : Your last roommate's kidney?
Eddie : That's a tomato.
Eddie : This one definitely goes in the display.
Joey : Hey, Gunther. Let me get a lemonade to go.
UNK: Lemonade?
UNK: You okay, man?
Joey : It's career stuff.
Joey : They killed off my character on the show.
Gunther : That's too bad. How'd they do it?
Joey : I fell down an elevator shaft.
Gunther : That sucks.
Gunther : I was buried in an avalanche.
UNK: What?
UNK: I used to be Brice on All My Children.
