Joey : Not my parrot.
Joey : I can't watch this.
Ross : Hey, hold on, hold on.
Ross : How much for the... How much to save the bird?
UNK: - Twelve hundred. - Dollars?
UNK: You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?
UNK: It was an impulse buy. Near the register.
Ross : Go ahead with the bird.
UNK: Do you have anything for around $200?
Mover : The dog.
Ross : I'll take it.
Ross : My gift to you, man.
Joey : Thanks, Ross!
