Chandler : I didn't realize that.
Chandler : Get out now!
Eddie : You really want me out?
Chandler : Yes, please.
Eddie : Then I want to hear you say you want me out.
Chandler : I want you out.
UNK: I want to hear it from your lips.
UNK: Where'd you hear it before?
Eddie : All right. You know what? Consider me gone.
UNK: I will go to my brother's basement. When he find out, I will find another man's house.
Eddie : I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Rachel : - Thank you. - I heard that.
UNK: Well, look at you!
Rachel : Finally got that time machine working, huh?
