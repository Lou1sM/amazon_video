Ross : But I don't know it.
UNK: What I do know is you owe $2300 at "Isn't It Chromantic?"
Joey : I'm aware of what I owe.
Ross : Then get some sense. It took you 10 years to get that job.
UNK: - How long till you get another? - I don't want to hear this!
Ross : I'm just saying...
UNK: Well, don't "just say"!
Ross : Maybe I should just go.
UNK: I'll see you later.
Ross : Just think about it.
Joey : I don't need to think about it!
UNK: I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
Joey : That was huge!
