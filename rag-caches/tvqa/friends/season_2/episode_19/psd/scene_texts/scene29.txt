Phoebe : Listen to you two. It's so sad.
UNK: Looks like I'll be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Rachel : Not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley...
Rachel : ...an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Monica : One hour?
Monica : You are such a leaf blower!
UNK: - That is not on the book. - No, but that's what you are.
Joey : Be careful with that 3-D Last Supper. Judas is a little loose.
UNK: Oh, my God! What's going on?
UNK: They're taking all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
UNK: No, I wasn't right. That's what I came here to tell you.
Ross : I was totally hung up on my own stuff the other day.
UNK: No, listen. I need the whole security thing, you know?
