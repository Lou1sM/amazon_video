UNK: I'm sorry, Joey.
Phoebe : Listen, sorry about your death. That really sucks.
Chandler : - We came over as soon as we saw. - How could you not tell us?
UNK: I don't know. I was kind of hoping no one would ever find out.
UNK: Well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.
Joey : They said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in...
Joey : ...that the only doctor who could've saved me was me.
