UNK: All of a sudden, she turns to me and says, "Eddie...
UNK: ...I don't wanna see you anymore."
Eddie : It was literally like she had reached into my chest...
Eddie : ...ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!
UNK: There was this incredible abyss and I'm falling.
Eddie : I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!
Eddie : That wasn't such a funny story.
Phoebe : And a crusty old man Said I'll do what I can
Phoebe : And the rest of the rats Played maracas
Phoebe : That's it! Thanks! Good night.
Richard : Phoebe's got another job, right?
UNK: Great set tonight, Pheebs.
UNK: Dr. Remore : I know.
UNK: We should get going.
UNK: We should too. I've got patients at 8 in the morning.
UNK: You know how we always stay at your apartment?
UNK: I thought tonight we'd stay at my place.
Richard : I don't know. I don't have my jammies.
Monica : You don't need them.
Ross : My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Monica : Shut up. I'm happy.
Phoebe : Oh, this is so nice! I have to make a speech.
Phoebe : Of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot...
Phoebe : ...I like you the best.
