UNK: It's supposed to be some kind of irony.
Phoebe : But Joey, you're gonna be fine.
Phoebe : You don't need that show. It was just a dumb soap opera.
Joey : This was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Phoebe : Yes! I was going to incorporate that.
Phoebe : Here's Monica. She'll have something nice to say.
Monica : I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.
Monica : What? To me, that's nice.
UNK: It'll be okay. You know that.
Joey : No, I don't.

Joey : ...and you think that when you get it...
UNK: ...it'll never be as good as you thought.
Joey : But this so was.
Joey : It changed everything.
