Rachel : Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
Rachel : I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Joey : - Really? - Oh, please!
Rachel : That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.
Rachel : All it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.
UNK: Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.
Chandler : I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
Eddie : That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
UNK: This is nuts! Crazy! She came over for two minutes...
Chandler : ...dropped off a fish tank and left!
Eddie : Where's Buddy?
UNK: Buddy?
Eddie : My fish, Buddy.
Chandler : There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Eddie : This is unbelievable!
Eddie : You sleep with my ex-girlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying...
Eddie : ...then you kill my fish? My Buddy?
