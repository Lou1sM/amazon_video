Joey : Like, the other day, I got this credit card application...
UNK: ...and I was pre-approved!
Joey : I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life!
Chandler : I'm sorry, man.
Rachel : I don't know if this'll mean anything to you...
Rachel : ...but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
UNK: That means nothing to me.
