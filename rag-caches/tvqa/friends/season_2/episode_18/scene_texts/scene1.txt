UNK: Pheebs, play with me!
Phoebe : This game is grotesque!
Phoebe : Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar...
Phoebe : ...forced to play soccer forever?
UNK: Hello? Human rights violation!
Chandler : Don't feel so bad. After playing...
UNK: ...I break out the plastic women and everybody has a good time.
Phoebe : Why don't you play with your roommate?
Chandler : He's not a big fan of foosball.
Phoebe : Are we not getting along with the new boy?
UNK: No, he's all right. He spends most of his time in his room.
Phoebe : That's because you haven't gotten to know him.
Phoebe : Let's remedy that, shall we?
Chandler : - We don't need to. - It'll be fun!
Eddie : What was that?
UNK: I thought it'd be fun if we had beers and got to know each other.
UNK: All right.
UNK: Oh, good! Okay.
UNK: Oh, no! I have to go, because I'm late for...
Phoebe : ...my Green Eggs and Ham discussion group.
UNK: Tonight, it's "Why he would not eat them on a train."
Phoebe : - Have fun! Bye! - That was so lame.
UNK: Dr. Remore : I know.
UNK: Okay, talk to him.
UNK: So you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets or...?
