Phoebe : Is this true? That you write a lot of your own lines?
UNK: Well, kind of, yeah.
Joey : Remember last week when Alex was in the accident?
Joey : The line in the script was...
UNK: ..."If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die."

Joey : How can they do this to me?
UNK: All right, I'm just gonna go.
