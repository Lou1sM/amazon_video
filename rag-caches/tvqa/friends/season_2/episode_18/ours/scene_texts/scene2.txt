Eddie : That's good. So who broke up with who?
Chandler : I broke up with her.
UNK: She actually thought Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Eddie : When everybody knows that the capital of Cambodia is...
Chandler : It's not Sean Penn.
UNK: I got a funny one.
Eddie : My last girlfriend, Tilly. We're eating breakfast, right?
UNK: I made these pancakes. Like, 50 pancakes.
UNK: All of a sudden, she turns to me and says, "Eddie...
UNK: ...I don't wanna see you anymore."
Eddie : It was literally like she had reached into my chest...
Eddie : ...ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!
UNK: There was this incredible abyss and I'm falling.
Eddie : I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!
Eddie : That wasn't such a funny story.
