Rachel : I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Joey : - Really? - Oh, please!
Rachel : That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.
Rachel : All it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.
UNK: Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.
Chandler : I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
Eddie : That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
UNK: This is nuts! Crazy! She came over for two minutes...
Chandler : ...dropped off a fish tank and left!
Eddie : Where's Buddy?
UNK: Buddy?
Eddie : My fish, Buddy.
Chandler : There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Eddie : This is unbelievable!
Eddie : You sleep with my ex-girlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying...
Eddie : ...then you kill my fish? My Buddy?
Chandler : I didn't kill your fish!
Chandler : Look, Eddie
UNK: Would you look at what I'm doing?
UNK: Now that can't be smart.
Chandler : So we're just gonna take this guy right off you...
Chandler : ...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
UNK: Tangelo?
Richard : That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Richard : Well, that's not bad at all.
UNK: You had me thinking it was, like, a fleet.
UNK: You're okay with it?
Richard : Oh, honey, I'm fine.
UNK: Okay, about that two.
UNK: What?
UNK: All right.
Richard : What about my two?
Monica : It just seems like a really small number.
UNK: Right.
Monica : Don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?
Monica : Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh, my God! Am I an oat?
Richard : Honey, you are not an oat.
UNK: I don't know, I guess I'm just not an oat guy.
UNK: I've only slept with women I love.
Monica : You've only slept with two people.
UNK: Right.
Monica : You know I love you too, right?
Richard : Now I do.
Rachel : Ross, please listen to me.
Rachel : You are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.
Rachel : You care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
Ross : If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
UNK: Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack...
UNK: ...and I'll stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes!
UNK: What we have is special! All Paolo and I ever had was
UNK: "Animal sex"?
Ross : So what are you saying?
Ross : There's nothing between us "animal" at all?
Ross : There's not even, like, a little animal?
Ross : Not even, like...
Ross : ...chipmunk sex?
UNK: Try to hear me, okay?
Rachel : I'm not gonna lie to you.
Rachel : - It was good with Paolo. - Knock-knock.
Rachel : But what you and I have is so much better.
Rachel : We have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.
UNK: You know? I swear.
Rachel : This is the best...
Rachel : ...I have ever had.
Ross : Until now.
UNK: Richard told me he loved me.
Monica : - Oh, my God! - I know!
Rachel : Honey, that's great!
UNK: Dr. Remore : I know!
Monica : - I just can't find - Top drawer.
Rachel : - Hurry. - Why? You need one too?
UNK: Found them!
Monica : There's only one.
Monica : We'll be right there. We're just trying to decide something.
UNK: - They're trying to decide something. - Good. Good, good.
UNK: So was your mustache Did it used to be different?
UNK: How do you, you know, keep it so neat?
UNK: I have a comb.
UNK: - What is that? - A mustache comb.
Richard : Thank you.
UNK: Okay, I will do your laundry for one month.
UNK: I will, I will, I will...
Rachel : I will clean the apartment for two months.
Monica : I'll give this to you now, if you tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Ross : So were you in Nam?
UNK: We are both adults here. We must got some way to solve this.
UNK: - Rock, paper, scissors? - Gotcha.
UNK: Rachel And Monica : One, two, three.
UNK: Yes!
Monica : Fine. Go have sex.
Richard : No! You have got it completely wrong!
UNK: John Savage was Deer Hunter, no legs.
UNK: Jon Voight was Coming Home, couldn't feel his legs.
Ross : You've got it totally the other way around, my friend. Jon Voight
Rachel : - Honey? - What?
Phoebe : Shall we?
Monica : It's not gonna happen.
Monica : They're doing it tonight. We can do it tomorrow.
Richard : In the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
Chandler : So when I woke up this morning...
Chandler : ...he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!
UNK: Why?
Chandler : He thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Phoebe : Why would you kill his fish?
Chandler : Because sometimes after you sleep with someone...
UNK: ...you have to kill a fish.
Rachel : Chandler, honey...
UNK: Dr. Remore : ...I'm sorry.
Rachel : Can we watch Joey's show now, please?
Monica : Wait. He's not here yet.
Rachel : He knows what happens.
Chandler : I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
