UNK: Amber...
UNK: Dr. Remore : ...I'll always be there for you...
UNK: Dr. Remore : ...as a friend and as your brother.
Amber : Oh, Drake.
UNK: Dr Horton : Hard day, huh?
UNK: First the medical award, now this?
UNK: Dr. Remore : Some guys are just lucky, I guess.
UNK: Dr. Ramoray, report to first floor Emergency stat.
UNK: Dr. Remore : Well, then...
UNK: ...I guess that's me.
UNK: Dr. Remore : Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?
UNK: Dr. Horton : They only said you.
UNK: Oh, okay. All right.
Monica : I love you.
UNK: Dr. Remore : Yeah, whatever.
Phoebe : Oh, no!
Amber : Drake, look out!
Monica : - Did they just kill off Joey? - No!
Ross : Now maybe.
UNK: Come on! Open up! We want to talk to you!
UNK: I don't feel like talking!
UNK: Come on! We care about you.
Chandler : - We're worried about you. - And some of us really have to pee!
UNK: I'm sorry, Joey.
Phoebe : Listen, sorry about your death. That really sucks.
Chandler : - We came over as soon as we saw. - How could you not tell us?
UNK: I don't know. I was kind of hoping no one would ever find out.
UNK: Well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.
Joey : They said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in...
Joey : ...that the only doctor who could've saved me was me.
UNK: It's supposed to be some kind of irony.
Phoebe : But Joey, you're gonna be fine.
Phoebe : You don't need that show. It was just a dumb soap opera.
Joey : This was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Phoebe : Yes! I was going to incorporate that.
Phoebe : Here's Monica. She'll have something nice to say.
Monica : I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.
Monica : What? To me, that's nice.
UNK: It'll be okay. You know that.
Joey : No, I don't.
UNK: It's like you work your whole life for something...
Joey : ...and you think that when you get it...
UNK: ...it'll never be as good as you thought.
Joey : But this so was.
Joey : It changed everything.
Joey : Like, the other day, I got this credit card application...
UNK: ...and I was pre-approved!
Joey : I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life!
Chandler : I'm sorry, man.
Rachel : I don't know if this'll mean anything to you...
Rachel : ...but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
UNK: That means nothing to me.
UNK: Pecan sandy? Just made them.
UNK: Yeah, all right.
Chandler : Are these raisins?
Eddie : Sure, why not?
Chandler : Listen, Eddie.
Chandler : I've been thinking about our living situation.
Chandler : Why are you smiling?
Eddie : I got a little surprise. Look. There's a new fishy.
Eddie : I named him...
UNK: ...Chandler, you know, after you.
UNK: Well, that's not even a real fish.
Chandler : No, that's a Goldfish cracker.
UNK: So what's your point, man?
UNK: Okay, good night.
Chandler : You big freak of nature!
Richard : - Brisk tonight. - Oh, man.
Richard : - Let's never speak of this. - You got it.
