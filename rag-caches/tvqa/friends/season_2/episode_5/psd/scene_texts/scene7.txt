Joey : Do we need a cake?
Chandler : I know it's a little steep.
Chandler : But it's Ross.
Chandler : It's Ross.
UNK: See you later. I gotta go...
Chandler : ...do a thing!
UNK: Okay, sweetheart, I'll call you later.
UNK: You're not going through with this, are you?
Chandler : You know, I think I might just.
Rachel : What are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
UNK: Well, I gotta start saving up for Ross' birthday.
Joey : I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Phoebe : Can you believe how much this costs?
