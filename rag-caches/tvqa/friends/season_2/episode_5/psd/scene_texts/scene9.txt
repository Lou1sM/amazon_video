Joey : For Ross.
Ross : Oh, my God!
Monica : I'm at work...
UNK: ...just an ordinary day, chop, chop, saute, saute.
UNK: Suddenly, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
UNK: They fired the lunch chef, and guess who got the job?
Joey : If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Monica : Fortunately, it is me.
Monica : And they made me head of purchasing, thank you!
UNK: That's so cool!
UNK: Anyway, I think we should go out and celebrate.
UNK: You know, someplace nice.
