Chandler : If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.
Chandler : Maybe that's just how you feel.
UNK: Now you're telling us how we feel.
UNK: We never should have talked about this.
UNK: I'm gonna pass on the concert.
Phoebe : I'm just not in a very "Hootie" place right now.
Rachel : - Me neither. - Me too.
Monica : Guys, we bought the tickets.
Phoebe : Then you'll have extra seats for all your tiaras and stuff.
Chandler : Why did you look at me when you said that?
UNK: So I guess now we can't go.
UNK: Do what you want. Do we always have to do everything together?
Monica : You know what? You're right.
UNK: Fine.
Chandler : All right.
Chandler : We're gonna go.
Monica : It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Ross : Are you ready?
Chandler : Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
UNK: What? You had sex today?
Chandler : It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it!
UNK: I was awesome. She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
