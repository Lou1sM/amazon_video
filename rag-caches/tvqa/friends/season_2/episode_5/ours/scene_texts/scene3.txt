Chandler : Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?
Monica : I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Phoebe : Oh, it's like a skit.
Monica : Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks...
Monica : ...and an eggplant for Phoebe.
UNK: We switched suppliers at work, and they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.
Ross : But wait, there's more. Chandler, what is in that envelope?
Chandler : By the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.
Chandler : Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!
Chandler : The Blowfish!
UNK: It's on us. So don't worry. This is...
Monica : ...our treat.
Monica : Thank you.
Ross : Could you be less enthused?
Joey : Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.
Joey : But it just feels like...
UNK: Like?
UNK: Charity.
UNK: Charity?
UNK: We're just trying to do a nice thing here.
UNK: But you have to understand, your "nice thing" makes us feel about this big.
Phoebe : Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Ross : I don't understand. We can't win with you guys.
Chandler : If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.
Chandler : Maybe that's just how you feel.
UNK: Now you're telling us how we feel.
UNK: We never should have talked about this.
UNK: I'm gonna pass on the concert.
Phoebe : I'm just not in a very "Hootie" place right now.
Rachel : - Me neither. - Me too.
Monica : Guys, we bought the tickets.
Phoebe : Then you'll have extra seats for all your tiaras and stuff.
Chandler : Why did you look at me when you said that?
UNK: So I guess now we can't go.
UNK: Do what you want. Do we always have to do everything together?
Monica : You know what? You're right.
UNK: Fine.
Chandler : All right.
Chandler : We're gonna go.
Monica : It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
