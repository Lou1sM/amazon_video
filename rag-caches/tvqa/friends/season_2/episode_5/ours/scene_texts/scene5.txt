Jade : Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.
UNK: I bit my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Chandler : Well, that makes me feel so good.
Jade : It was just so awkward and bumpy.
UNK: Maybe he had some kind of new style that you're not familiar with.
Chandler : You have to get used to it.
UNK: There wasn't much time to get used to it...
UNK: ...if you know what I mean.
Monica : You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Ross : I know. It's my birthday. We all should be here.
Chandler : So let's go.
UNK: Well, maybe we should stay for one song.
Chandler : It would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Monica : The guys are probably having a great time.
Joey : Come on, you guys. One more time.
UNK: One.
Monica : - Amazing! - Excellent!
UNK: I can't believe the guys missed it!
Ross : What guys? Oh, yeah.
UNK: Young Man : Excuse me. Aren't you Monica Geller?
Monica : - Do I know you? - You were my baby-sitter!
Ross : Oh, my God! Little Stevie Fisher?
UNK: How have you been?
Steve : Good. I'm a lawyer now.
Monica : You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.
Steve : It was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Monica : Wait, backstage?
Steve : My firm represents the band.
Steve : You guys wanna meet the group?
Chandler : Come on.
Steve : Are you one of the ones that fooled around with my Dad?
Ross : Hey, you guys!
Rachel : Happy birthday!
Monica : Oh, thank you.
Ross : How was your night last night?
Rachel : Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
UNK: Ours pretty much sucked too.
UNK: But I ran into Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Ross : Oh, yeah! I used to baby-sit him.
Rachel : Hey, how's his dad?
UNK: Good.
UNK: Aside from that, the evening was pretty much a bust.
Chandler : Yeah, we really missed you guys.
UNK: Yeah, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.
Phoebe : We just have to really, really not let stuff like money, get like
Phoebe : Is that a hickey?
UNK: Oh, no, I just...
Monica : I fell down.
Rachel : On someone's lips?
Rachel : Where'd you get the hickey?
Monica : You know, a party or
Rachel : What party?
UNK: It wasn't a party so much as a...
Ross : ...a gathering of people.
Ross : With food and music and...
Ross : ...and the band.
Joey : You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Chandler : Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie are like this.
Rachel : Who gave you that hickey?
Monica : That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Phoebe : I can't believe it! I can't believe this!
UNK: We're just sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers...
UNK: ...and you're partying and having fun and all :
Phoebe : "Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"
Ross : Don't blame us. You could've been there.
Rachel : What? As part of your "poor friends outreach program"?
Monica : Oh, great. It's work.
Chandler : I don't know what to say. I'm sorry we make more than you.
Chandler : But we're not gonna feel guilty. We work really hard.
Joey : And we don't work hard?
UNK: It's Monica. I got a page.
UNK: It's just that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Joey : And you feel like we hold you back.
UNK: Leon, wait.
UNK: Guys!
Ross : I don't understand.
UNK: The steaks were a gift from the meat vendor.
UNK: That was not a kickback.
Monica : I'll just replace them, and we can forget the whole thing.
Monica : What corporate policy?
Monica : I just got fired.
Waitress : Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
Joey : Let me get that.
UNK: You got 5 bucks?
Machine : Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
Jade : Hi, it's me.
Jade : Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.
UNK: It's been three years, and you 're probably seeing someone else now...
UNK: ...but if we could have one night together, for old time's sake...
Jade : One hot, steamy, wild night...
