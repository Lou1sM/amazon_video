Ross : Are you ready?
Chandler : Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
UNK: What? You had sex today?
Chandler : It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it!
UNK: I was awesome. She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
UNK: I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.
Ross : Still doing the screening?
Chandler : I had sex today.
Chandler : I never have to answer that phone again.
UNK: At the sound of the beep, you know what to do.
Jade : Hey, Bob. It's Jade.
UNK: I wanted to tell you I was really hurt when you didn't show up yesterday.
Jade : And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Chandler : Bob here.
Chandler : So you met someone, huh?
Jade : Yes, I did.
Jade : In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.
Chandler : So how was he?
