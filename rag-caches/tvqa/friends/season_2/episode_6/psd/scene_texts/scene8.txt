Joey : Women love guys who love babies. It's the sensitive thing.
UNK: Aim him at that pack of babes. Maybe one of them will break away.
UNK: Wait, forget them. We got one. Hard left.
UNK: - Give me the baby. - No, I got him.
UNK: Come on, seriously.
Chandler : Oh, seriously, you want him?
UNK: Who is this little cutie-pie?
UNK: Well, don't think me immodest, but...
UNK: ...me.
UNK: Want to smell him?
Woman : I assume we're talking about the baby?
