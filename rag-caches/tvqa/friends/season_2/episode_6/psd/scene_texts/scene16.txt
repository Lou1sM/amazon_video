UNK: Oh, boy! You are doing so good.
UNK: You want to squeeze my hand?
Monica : Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
Monica : Honey, really. Don't squeeze it so hard!
Monica : Let go of my hand!
UNK: Good plan. Next time we want to pick up women...
UNK: ...we should go to the park and make out.
Chandler : Taxi! Taxi!
Joey : Look at that talent.
Chandler : Just practicing. You're good.
Chandler : Carry on.
Joey : Wait, wait, wait!
UNK: Girl No. 1 : Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Chandler : Can you tell him that? Because he thinks he looks too pink.
UNK: Girl No. 2 : - What are you guys out doing today? - We're not out.
UNK: We're two heterosexual guys hanging with the son...
Joey : ...of our other heterosexual friend, doing the usual straight-guy stuff.
Chandler : You done?
UNK: Girl No. 1 : There's our stop.
UNK: Get out of here! This is our stop.
UNK: Girl No. 2 : You guys live around here too?
Joey : We live in the building by the sidewalk.
Chandler : You know it?
UNK: Since we're neighbors, what do you say we get together for a drink?
