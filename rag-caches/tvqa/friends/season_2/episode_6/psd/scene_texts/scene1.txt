Ross : There we go, all better.
Monica : There's my little boy.
Chandler : Can I see something?
UNK: Cool!
Monica : He hates me. My nephew hates me!
UNK: I'm unemployed, and my nephew hates me!
UNK: Stop, don't do this. You are just unemployed.
Monica : What if my own baby hates me? What do I do then?
UNK: Monica, stop! This is nuts.

Chandler : You don't even have a boyfriend yet.
Chandler : Joey, she does not look fat.
Monica : Here you go.
