UNK: That one's Ben! Remember he had that cute little mole by his mouth!
Chandler : Hey, Ben! Remember us?
UNK: Okay, the mole came off.
Chandler : What are we gonna do?
Joey : We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Chandler : - Flip for the baby? - You got a better idea?
Chandler : All right, call it in the air.
UNK: Heads.
Chandler : Heads, it is.
