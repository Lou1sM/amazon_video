Rachel : Well, people missed you in there.
Rachel : In fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat."
Phoebe : Really? From who?
UNK: Well, me.
Rachel : And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Kid : Did I accidentally drop a condom in your case?
Kid : It's kind of an emergency.
Monica : - Here you go. - Thanks a lot.
Kid : Hey, Christine! I got it!
UNK: I want to thank you for being there for me.
Ross : And I'm sorry I almost broke your hand.
UNK: That's okay. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
