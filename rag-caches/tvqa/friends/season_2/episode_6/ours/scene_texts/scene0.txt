UNK: Who the winny-binny boy?
UNK: You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!
Monica : Don't cry.
Monica : Don't cry.
Monica : Why is he still crying?
UNK: Don't worry. Nothing can't be solved by happy keys.
UNK: Yeah, I was feel much better when someone shaked Jacks medal in my face.
Ross : Let me hold him for a sec.
Ross : Here we go.
Ross : There we are.
UNK: Maybe it's me.
Ross : Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.
Chandler : You know, I once dated a Miss Cranky Pants.
UNK: Lovely girl. Kind of moody.
Ross : There we go, all better.
Monica : There's my little boy.
Chandler : Can I see something?
UNK: Cool!
Monica : He hates me. My nephew hates me!
UNK: I'm unemployed, and my nephew hates me!
UNK: Stop, don't do this. You are just unemployed.
Monica : What if my own baby hates me? What do I do then?
UNK: Monica, stop! This is nuts.
UNK: Do you know how long it'll be before you have to deal with this problem?
Chandler : You don't even have a boyfriend yet.
Chandler : Joey, she does not look fat.
Monica : Here you go.
Joey : Goo, goo, goo!
Monica : That is so funny! Let me see that a sec.
UNK: You okay?
Ross : I don't know.
Ross : What's in this pie?
UNK: I don't know. Butter and eggs and flour and lime and kiwi
Ross : Kiwi? Kiwi?!
Ross : You said it was a key lime pie.
Monica : No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
Ross : That's what's gonna kill me.
Ross : I'm allergic to kiwi.
UNK: No, you're not. You're allergic to lobster and peanuts and
Monica : Oh, my God!
Ross : It's definitely getting worse.
Monica : Is your tongue swelling up?
Ross : Either that or my mouth is getting smaller!
Monica : Get your coat. We're going to the hospital.
UNK: - Will he be okay? - He's gotta get a shot.
Ross : You know, actually, it's getting better. It is.
Ross : Let's not go. Anyone up for Scrabble?
Monica : Jacket, now!
Ross : What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to the hospital.
Joey : We'll watch him.
UNK: I don't think so.
Joey : I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids.
UNK: Come on, we want to do it. Don't we?
UNK: I was gonna play basketball...
Chandler : ...but I guess that's out the window.
UNK: If you take him out for a walk, remember to bring his hat.
UNK: There's milk in the refrigerator and diapers in the bag.
Joey : Hat, milk...
Joey : Got it!
Joey : Consider it done!
Chandler : You understood?
Joey : My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Chandler : Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
UNK: You want to hear the song I'm singing this afternoon?
Phoebe : I wrote it this morning in the shower.

Terry : Rachel, sweetheart, could I see you for a minute?
Rachel : What's up?
FYI :
Terry : I've decided to pay a professional musician to play here on Sundays.
Terry : Her name is Stephanie something. She's supposed to be very good.
Rachel : But what about Phoebe?
Terry : It's not that your friend is bad.
Terry : It's that she's so bad...
Terry : ...she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain...
Terry : ...and swirl it around.
UNK: Okay, so you're not a fan.
Rachel : But, I mean, come on. You cannot do this to her.
Rachel : I have to do this to her?
Phoebe : Lather, rinse, repeat
Phoebe : And lather, rinse, repeat
Phoebe : And lather, rinse, repeat
Phoebe : As needed
UNK: We didn't bring enough stuff.
Chandler : Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
UNK: I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.
Joey : It's a known fact that women love babies.
Joey : Women love guys who love babies. It's the sensitive thing.
UNK: Aim him at that pack of babes. Maybe one of them will break away.
UNK: Wait, forget them. We got one. Hard left.
UNK: - Give me the baby. - No, I got him.
UNK: Come on, seriously.
Chandler : Oh, seriously, you want him?
UNK: Who is this little cutie-pie?
UNK: Well, don't think me immodest, but...
UNK: ...me.
UNK: Want to smell him?
Woman : I assume we're talking about the baby?
Joey : He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
Woman : My uterus just skipped a beat.
Joey : What'd I tell you?
UNK: It's great you're doing this.
Chandler : Well, we are great guys.
Woman : My brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt.
Woman : What agency did you two go through?
Phoebe : But this is my gig.
Phoebe : This is where I play.
Phoebe : My name is written out there in chalk.
Phoebe : You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Rachel : Honey, I'm sorry.
Phoebe : And he's going to be paying this woman?
Phoebe : Why doesn't he just give her a throne and a crown?
UNK: And, like, a gold stick with a ball on top?
UNK: Terry is a jerk! That's why we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"
Rachel : That's where that came from.
Phoebe : You probably did everything you could.
UNK: You know what? Let me just see what else I could do.
Rachel : Just let her go on after Stephanie whatever her name is.
UNK: You won't be here. You don't pay her.
Ross : I don't know.
UNK: I'll clean the cappuccino machine!
Terry : You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Rachel : Of course I clean it.
UNK: I mean, I will clean it.
UNK: I mean, I will clean it.
Terry : All right, fine, fine, fine!
Joey : - Done. - Really?
UNK: Who's working for you, babe?
Phoebe : Oh, my God! This is so exciting! How much am I gonna get?
UNK: What?
Phoebe : He's paying the people who were playing.
UNK: I meant, he's paying that other woman because she's a professional.
Phoebe : I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Phoebe : I'm sorry, no!
UNK: No, I'm not some sloppy second, you know, charity band.
Phoebe : There are thousands of places in this city...
UNK: ...where people would pay to hear me play.
Phoebe : When I play, I play for me
Phoebe : I don't need your charity
Phoebe : Thank you!
UNK: I'm not getting a shot. Maybe they can take the needle...
UNK: ...and squirt it into my mouth. Like a squirt gun.
Doctor : Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.
Doctor : I see someone's having a little allergic reaction.
Monica : Doctor, can I see you for just a moment?
Monica : My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Ross : Did you tell him about my squirt gun idea?
Monica : My brother, the Ph.D., would like to know...
Monica : ...if there's any way to treat this orally?
Doctor : Under these circumstances, it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
UNK: So?
UNK: Go and have a seat. The doctor says it's got to be a needle.
UNK: You're just going to have to be brave. Can you do that for me?
UNK: Oh, boy! You are doing so good.
UNK: You want to squeeze my hand?
Monica : Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
Monica : Honey, really. Don't squeeze it so hard!
Monica : Let go of my hand!
UNK: Good plan. Next time we want to pick up women...
UNK: ...we should go to the park and make out.
Chandler : Taxi! Taxi!
Joey : Look at that talent.
Chandler : Just practicing. You're good.
Chandler : Carry on.
Joey : Wait, wait, wait!
UNK: Girl No. 1 : Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Chandler : Can you tell him that? Because he thinks he looks too pink.
UNK: Girl No. 2 : - What are you guys out doing today? - We're not out.
UNK: We're two heterosexual guys hanging with the son...
Joey : ...of our other heterosexual friend, doing the usual straight-guy stuff.
Chandler : You done?
UNK: Girl No. 1 : There's our stop.
UNK: Get out of here! This is our stop.
UNK: Girl No. 2 : You guys live around here too?
Joey : We live in the building by the sidewalk.
Chandler : You know it?
UNK: Since we're neighbors, what do you say we get together for a drink?
UNK: So you want to go to Markel's?
Chandler : Sure, they love us over there.
UNK: Girl No. 2 : Where's your baby?
UNK: Chandler And Joey : Ben! Ben!
Chandler : That's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord!
UNK: Chandler And Joey : Stop the bus!
Monica : Are you sure he didn't break it? It's really hurt.
Doctor : No, it's just a good bone bruise.
