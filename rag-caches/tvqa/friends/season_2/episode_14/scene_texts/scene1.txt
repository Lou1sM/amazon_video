Interviewer : If I want to call for a reference on your last job...?
UNK: That's right there, see? The manager, Chandler Bing?
UNK: All right.
Interviewer : Let's see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
UNK: A salad? I could do something more complicated.
UNK: No, just the salad will be fine.
Monica : You got it.
Interviewer : Now I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
UNK: All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
Interviewer : Is it dirty?
UNK: Oh, I'm gonna wash it.
Interviewer : Don't. I like it dirty.
Monica : That's your call.
Interviewer : So, what are you going to do next?
Monica : I thought that I'd cut up the tomatoes.
Interviewer : Are they firm?
UNK: They're all right.
Interviewer : You sure they haven't gone bad?
UNK: You sure they're not very, very bad?
UNK: No, really, they're okay.
Interviewer : You gonna slice them up real nice?
UNK: I was going to do them julienne.
