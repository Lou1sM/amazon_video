UNK: Over here, Jack. Okay.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Rachel's coming up the path.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?
UNK: Can you get this?
Ross : Oh, my God!
Joey : What is with your nose?
Rachel : They had to reduce it because of my deviated septum.
UNK: Okay, I was wrong. That's what they use to cover Connecticut.
Monica : This is us getting ready for the prom.
Ross : We don't have to watch.
All : Yeah, we do.
UNK: - Come on! - It's fun!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Get a shot of Monica.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Where's Monica?
Monica : Over here, Dad!
UNK: Mr, Geller : Wait. How do you zoom out?
UNK: Mr, Geller : There she is!
Joey : Some girl ate Monica!
Monica : Shut up! The camera adds ten pounds.
Chandler : So how many cameras are actually on you?
Monica : Oh, you look so great!
UNK: So do you! You look beautiful!
Monica : - Oops. - What?
UNK: I think I got mayonnaise on you.
UNK: Oh, it's just the shoulder, not my dress.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Everybody smile!
Monica : Oh, Dad, turn it off!
UNK: Mr. Geller : It is off.
Monica : It is not! What's with the red light?
UNK: Mr. Geller : It's the off light.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Right, Ross?
UNK: Looking good, Mr. IKotter.
Ross : - You look pretty tonight. - Oh, thanks.
UNK: - What are you doing this summer? - I'm gonna hang out...
Ross : ...work on my music.
Rachel : Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down.
Ross : Let me see. I don't know.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : What are you gonna do...
Rachel : The guys are here!
Rachel : ...this summer?
Chandler : Work on your music?
Ross : Oh, my God! There's Roy Gublik!
UNK: You know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times.
UNK: He was in the paper.
Rachel : Where's Chip? Why isn't he here yet?
UNK: He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.
UNK: There.
Monica : I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
UNK: I can't go to the prom without a date. I can't! It's too late!
Monica : If you're not going, then I don't want to go.
Roy : Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : I have a wonderful idea.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : You should take Rachel to the prom.
UNK: Doubtful.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
UNK: All right, go on. This thing's heavy.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Your mother's right. Take her. You can wear my tux.
UNK: She won't wanna go with me.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Of course she would! You're a college man!
Chandler : - I don't know. - Well, come on.
UNK: Don't you wanna find out?
Chandler : I can't believe I can't go to the prom!
Rachel : This is so harsh!
Ross : - Hold my board. - Thataboy! Thataboy!
Ross : I think we've seen enough.
Ross : Let's turn it off.
Ross : Well, I'm not gonna watch.
UNK: Come on, kid. Let's go!
UNK: - My! Are you handsome! - Let's show them!
Ross : Just a sec, Dad.
UNK: Okay, be cool. Just be cool.
UNK: Okay, Dad.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining
Chandler : Oh, no.
UNK: Don't wait up!
UNK: Chip!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Oh, dear!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : How do I turn this off?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Press the button.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Which one? Which button? Jack!
UNK: Mr. Geller : The button! The button!
Monica : I can't believe you did that.
Monica : Yeah, well...
Phoebe : See? He's her lobster!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Dance with him!
Monica : Mom, I'm hungry!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Dance with your father.
UNK: I don't know any of your flashdances, but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
UNK: All right.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : - Oh, Jack! - Oh, Judy!
