UNK: ...you know, make a little love...
Chandler : Well, pretty much get down tonight.
Ross : I don't know. I don't
UNK: I don't get it! Two months ago, Rachel and I were this close.
UNK: Now I'm taking messages from guys she meets at the movies?
UNK: I mean, this Casey should be taking down my messages, you know?
Ross : Or Rachel and I should be together...
Ross : ...and we should get some kind of message service.
Phoebe : Hang in there. It's gonna happen.
Ross : Now, how do you know that?
Phoebe : Because she's your lobster.
UNK: Oh, she's going somewhere.
