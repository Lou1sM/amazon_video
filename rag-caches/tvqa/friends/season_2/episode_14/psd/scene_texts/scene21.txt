Monica : I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Thank you, I'm very grateful.
Phoebe : Hey, Mon, what is this?
UNK: That's my bathing suit from high school. I was a little bigger then.
UNK: I thought they used that to cover Connecticut when it rains.
UNK: Hey, what's on this videotape?
Chandler : I don't know. Let's put it in.
UNK: Over here, Jack. Okay.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Rachel's coming up the path.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?
UNK: Can you get this?
Ross : Oh, my God!
Joey : What is with your nose?
Rachel : They had to reduce it because of my deviated septum.
UNK: Okay, I was wrong. That's what they use to cover Connecticut.
Monica : This is us getting ready for the prom.
Ross : We don't have to watch.
All : Yeah, we do.
UNK: - Come on! - It's fun!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Get a shot of Monica.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Where's Monica?
Monica : Over here, Dad!
UNK: Mr, Geller : Wait. How do you zoom out?
UNK: Mr, Geller : There she is!
Joey : Some girl ate Monica!
Monica : Shut up! The camera adds ten pounds.
Chandler : So how many cameras are actually on you?
Monica : Oh, you look so great!
UNK: So do you! You look beautiful!
Monica : - Oops. - What?
UNK: I think I got mayonnaise on you.
UNK: Oh, it's just the shoulder, not my dress.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Everybody smile!
Monica : Oh, Dad, turn it off!
UNK: Mr. Geller : It is off.
Monica : It is not! What's with the red light?
UNK: Mr. Geller : It's the off light.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Right, Ross?
UNK: Looking good, Mr. IKotter.
Ross : - You look pretty tonight. - Oh, thanks.
UNK: - What are you doing this summer? - I'm gonna hang out...
Ross : ...work on my music.
Rachel : Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down.
Ross : Let me see. I don't know.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : What are you gonna do...
Rachel : The guys are here!
Rachel : ...this summer?
Chandler : Work on your music?
