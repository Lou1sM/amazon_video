Chandler : Wow, I don't know what to say.
UNK: What do you say?
Chandler : I don't know.
Chandler : It's a bracelet.
UNK: Isn't it? It's engraved, too. Check it out.
UNK: "To my best bud."
Chandler : Thanks, best bud.
Joey : Put it on.
UNK: Now?
UNK: No, it should be saved for a special occasion.
Joey : No, that's the beauty part. It goes with everything.
UNK: When you put this on, you're good to go.
