UNK: I'm out of here!
UNK: Hello?
Ross : Rachel's not here. Can I take a message?
Ross : How do we spell Casey?
UNK: Is it like "at the bat" or "and The Sunshine Band"?
UNK: Hey, who's this Casey?
Phoebe : Some guy she met at the movies.
Ross : What does he want with her?
UNK: I guess he wants to do a little dance...
UNK: ...you know, make a little love...
Chandler : Well, pretty much get down tonight.
Ross : I don't know. I don't
UNK: I don't get it! Two months ago, Rachel and I were this close.
UNK: Now I'm taking messages from guys she meets at the movies?
UNK: I mean, this Casey should be taking down my messages, you know?
Ross : Or Rachel and I should be together...
Ross : ...and we should get some kind of message service.
Phoebe : Hang in there. It's gonna happen.
Ross : Now, how do you know that?
Phoebe : Because she's your lobster.
UNK: Oh, she's going somewhere.
Phoebe : It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.
Phoebe : You know what? You can actually see old lobster couples...
UNK: ...walking around their tank, holding claws, like...
UNK: Hey, you feeling better?
Monica : Yeah, I think that fifth shower got the interview off me.
UNK: Do you have other possibilities?
UNK: There is the possibility that I won't make rent.
Chandler : If you want, I can lend you money.
Monica : If I couldn't pay you back right away, I'd feel guilty and tense around you.
UNK: Then why not borrow it from Mom and Dad?
Ross : You feel guilty and tense around them already.
Ross : Might as well make some money off of them.
Chandler : The man's got a point.
Phoebe : What is that sparkly thing?
Chandler : That thing?
UNK: Yeah, it's a little flashy.
Chandler : No, no.
Ross : No, no. It's not flashy. Not for a goodfella.
UNK: Man, that is sharp! That must have cost you quite a few doubloons.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Hi, darling.
Chandler : What's this?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Some of your old stuff.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : We're turning your room into a gym.
Monica : Wow, that is a surprise!
UNK: Just one question. Why not Ross's room?
UNK: Mr. Geller : We talked about that...
UNK: ...but your brother had so many science trophies, plaques, merit badges...
UNK: Mr. Geller : We didn't want to disturb them.
Monica : God forbid!
UNK: What's with you. What can you tell us. How is your job.
UNK: My job, well!
UNK: Do I mention that I still don't have a boyfriend.
UNK: I just assume
UNK: Mrs. Geller : We were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up.
UNK: Well, they're just separated. You never know! We'll see.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I can't say any of us were surprised.
UNK: They've been unhappy ever since we've known them.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
Rachel : What? What incident?
UNK: No, no. I must be thinking of someone else.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Maybe me!
UNK: Mr. Geller : Don't you have some folding to do?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Fold. You fold.
Phoebe : - Want a refill? - I'm all right, thanks.
Phoebe : Give me a second. I want to get this just right.
UNK: Dude, eleven o'clock, totally hot babe checking you out.
Phoebe : That was really good. I think I'm ready for my penis now.
Chandler : I know what you're thinking. Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
Gail : I'm Gail.
Gail : I really have to be somewhere, but it was nice meeting you.
UNK: Excellent!
UNK: He could have gotten me a VCR or a set of golf clubs.
UNK: But no! He got me the "woman repeller"!
Chandler : The eyesore from the Liberace House of Crap!
UNK: - It's not bad. - Easy for you to say.
UNK: You're not sporting a reject from the Mr. Tcollection!
UNK: "I pity the fool that puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!"
UNK: "I pity that fool"
Chandler : Hey, man! We were just doing some impressions.
Chandler : Do your Marcel Marceau.
Chandler : That's actually good.
Ross : Would you look at that guy?
Ross : How long has he been talking to her?
UNK: I don't know. A couple of minutes.
UNK: Yeah, try doubling that.
Ross : It's like, back off, buddy! She's a waitress, not a geisha.
