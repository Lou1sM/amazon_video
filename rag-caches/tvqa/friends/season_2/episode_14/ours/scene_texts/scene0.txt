Chandler : Hold on a second.
UNK: Nice.
UNK: I got you something.
Chandler : What's this?
Joey : Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
UNK: Didn't Big Leon tell you? It's a thousand...
UNK: ...to have me for the whole night.
UNK: What's this for?
UNK: Well, I'm making money now.
UNK: I'm paying you back for headshots, electric bills, all that pizza...
UNK: I love you, man.
Chandler : Well, thanks, man. Now I can get my pony.
UNK: This is a little extra something for...
UNK: ...always being there for me.
Chandler : Wow, I don't know what to say.
Chandler : Wow, I don't know what to say.
UNK: What do you say?
Chandler : I don't know.
Chandler : It's a bracelet.
UNK: Isn't it? It's engraved, too. Check it out.
UNK: "To my best bud."
Chandler : Thanks, best bud.
Joey : Put it on.
UNK: Now?
UNK: No, it should be saved for a special occasion.
Joey : No, that's the beauty part. It goes with everything.
UNK: When you put this on, you're good to go.
UNK: I'm never being good to go, so why don't try some jewrel.
UNK: Oh, man!
UNK: You are so wearing that bracelet!
Chandler : I so am!
Joey : Any idea what this will do for your sex life?
UNK: It might slow down at first, but...
UNK: ...once I'm used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
