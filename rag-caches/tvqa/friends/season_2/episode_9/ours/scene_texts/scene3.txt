Grandmother : Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.
Grandmother : But to me, he's still the irresponsible creep...
UNK: ...who locked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
UNK: I know. I just wanted to know who he was, you know?
Joey : Yeah, I know.
Grandmother : I wasn't completely honest with you when I said I didn't know...
Grandmother : ...exactly where he lived.
UNK: What do you mean?
Grandmother : He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.
Grandmother : If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far.
Grandmother : You can take my cab.
Rachel : Thank you.
Grandmother : - Nobody else drives that cab. - Got it.
Phoebe : I'm gonna see my dad!
Rachel : Thank you.
Phoebe : Wish me luck, Grandpa.
Joey : Phoebe here with the cab yet?
UNK: Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.
Chandler : Hop in!
UNK: She'd better get here. The stores close at 7.
UNK: It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house...
UNK: ...they'll meet, chat, swap life stories.
UNK: We'll have plenty of time.
Joey : Hey, here she comes!
Phoebe : Can you believe this?
Phoebe : In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad.
Joey : Yeah, big stuff!
UNK: Okay, let's go!
Phoebe : Here, you have to hold this.
UNK: "Brake, left. Gas, right"?
Phoebe : That's my cheat sheet.
Chandler : - Where's my seat belt? - There isn't one.
Phoebe : The paramedics had to cut through it.
UNK: Come on, just tell me. Please, please!
UNK: For the 16th time : No, I do not think you're obsessive!
Rachel : - It's hot in here! - Rach, get the heat.
UNK: Ross, turn the heat down, please?
UNK: The difference between obsessive
Monica : Ross, the heat!
UNK: Okay! Heat, heat, heat! And I'm the obsessive one?
Ross : This way is on.
Ross : So this is...
UNK: ...off.
Rachel : Did you just break the radiator?
UNK: No, I was turning the knob and...
Ross : ...here it is.
Monica : Well, put it back!
Ross : It won't go back.
Rachel : I'll call the super.
Monica : Here, let me try.
Ross : That's right. I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Monica : Hey, it's Funny's cousin...
Monica : ...Not Funny!
Rachel : Hi, Mr. Treeger?
UNK: It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.
Rachel : Yes, somebody broke our knob on the radiator...
Rachel : ...and it's really hot in here.
UNK: Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.
UNK: Could we have a new one by 6?
UNK: Tuesday? We can't wait until Tuesday.
Rachel : We're having a party tonight.
UNK: Okay, tip the man.
Monica : If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad.
UNK: I won't be blackmailed.
UNK: Look, if it gets a little warm...
UNK: ...it can be a theme party.
UNK: Here's a theme : "Come on in, live like bacon!"
Phoebe : This is it!
UNK: Seventy-four.
Chandler : So that's what this is for!
Phoebe : This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.
Phoebe : This is like the biggest thing ever.
Joey : Sure is.
UNK: Here I go. I'm going in.
UNK: All right!
UNK: Good luck, Pheebs.
Phoebe : Here I go.
Phoebe : Here I go.
UNK: I'm going.
Rachel : Welcome to our tropical Christmas party.
UNK: Put your coats, sweaters, pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Ross : It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...
Ross : ...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.
Ross : An amount about the size of a pea. How can that be too much?
UNK: Ice?
Monica : Ice? Ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.
UNK: Monica!
UNK: Your guests are turning into jerky.
UNK: Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.
Monica : Hey! Get in line, buddy. I was next.
Rachel : Mr. Treeger.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : You said there was a party.
Rachel : Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Is it hot? My body always stays cool.
UNK: Probably because I have so much skin.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Hey, cheese!
Ross : Here's the chance. Monica, give him cash.
Ross : Rachel, give him your earrings. Something. Anything!
Monica : No, I will not cave.
Rachel : I'm with Mon.
UNK: All right. You know how you say I never seize the day?
Ross : Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.
Rachel : Mr. Treeger?
UNK: Here is $50. Merry Christmas.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : I didn't get you anything.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Here's five back.
UNK: No, that's your Christmas tip.
Ross : Do you think there's a chance you can fix that radiator now?
UNK: Mr. Treeger : No can do. Like I told the girl...
UNK: ...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.
UNK: Ross?
UNK: He's playing baseball.
Ross : You mean hardball?
UNK: Whatever.
UNK: What you gonna do?
Ross : Excuse me. I'm seizing.
Rachel : Mr. Treeger?
Ross : Here's another 50.
Ross : Happy Hanukkah.
Ross : Will this help with the knob-getting?
UNK: Mr. Treeger : No, the place is not open till Tuesday.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Am I not saying it right?
UNK: So you really did like my cookies?
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Yeah, they were so personal. It really showed you cared.
Rachel : Nice seizing...
Rachel : ...gel boy.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Is this mistletoe?
Phoebe : No, that...
Rachel : That is basil.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.
Rachel : No, it's still basil.
UNK: Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
UNK: Jack Frost nipping at your nose
UNK: - How far did you get? - Mailbox.
UNK: All right, we're getting closer.
UNK: What's going on?
Phoebe : It's just like a whole mess of stuff.
UNK: Like yesterday, my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.
UNK: And you know, now he's a pharmacist guy and...
UNK: Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Phoebe : Yeah, maybe! And I'll knock on the door...
Phoebe : ...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad!
Phoebe : I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me...
UNK: ...because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.
Chandler : So why not go knock?
UNK: Because, I mean, what if he's not this great-dad guy?
UNK: What if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?
Phoebe : You know what?
Phoebe : I've already lost a fake dad this week.
Phoebe : I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
UNK: Pheebs, that's okay. You took a big step today.
Chandler : Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Joey : And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Joey : You guys...
Phoebe : Sorry about your shopping.
UNK: Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.
UNK: I know you're not going in there...
UNK: ...but you think it's okay if I go in and use his bathroom?
Joey : That's fine, never mind.
Joey : Cool, snow!
UNK: Kind of like a blank canvas.
UNK: Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!
Joey : You mind if I turn the heat down?
Monica : We could have used that kind of thinking earlier!
UNK: So, Pheebs, how did it go?
Phoebe : Oh, I couldn't go in.
Monica : - Honey, I'm sorry. - Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah, it's okay, because I know he's there.
Phoebe : So that's enough for now.
UNK: Hey, it's after midnight! Merry Christmas, everyone!
UNK: Oh, right! Merry Christmas!
Joey : The knob was broken...
UNK: ...so I turned it off from underneath. I hope that's all right.
Joey : Rach, these are for you.
Rachel : Wiper blades!
Rachel : I don't even have a car.
UNK: No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do!
UNK: Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
UNK: Toilet-seat covers!
UNK: Is that what you did while I got gas?
Joey : You guys!
Joey : And for Ross...
UNK: ...Mr. Sweet Tooth.
Ross : You got me a cola drink?
UNK: And a lemon-lime!
UNK: Well, this is too much! I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Chandler : And last, but not least...
Joey : They're ribbed for your pleasure!
