UNK: I know. I just wanted to know who he was, you know?
Joey : Yeah, I know.
Grandmother : I wasn't completely honest with you when I said I didn't know...
Grandmother : ...exactly where he lived.
UNK: What do you mean?
Grandmother : He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.
Grandmother : If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far.
Grandmother : You can take my cab.
Rachel : Thank you.
Grandmother : - Nobody else drives that cab. - Got it.
Phoebe : I'm gonna see my dad!
Rachel : Thank you.
Phoebe : Wish me luck, Grandpa.
Joey : Phoebe here with the cab yet?
UNK: Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.
Chandler : Hop in!
UNK: She'd better get here. The stores close at 7.
UNK: It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house...
UNK: ...they'll meet, chat, swap life stories.
UNK: We'll have plenty of time.
Joey : Hey, here she comes!
