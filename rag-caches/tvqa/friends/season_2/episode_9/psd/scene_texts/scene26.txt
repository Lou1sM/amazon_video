Phoebe : Here I go.
Phoebe : Here I go.
UNK: I'm going.
Rachel : Welcome to our tropical Christmas party.
UNK: Put your coats, sweaters, pants and shirts in the bedroom.
Ross : It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...
Ross : ...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.
Ross : An amount about the size of a pea. How can that be too much?
UNK: Ice?
Monica : Ice? Ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.
UNK: Monica!
UNK: Your guests are turning into jerky.
UNK: Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.
Monica : Hey! Get in line, buddy. I was next.
Rachel : Mr. Treeger.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : You said there was a party.
Rachel : Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Is it hot? My body always stays cool.
UNK: Probably because I have so much skin.
UNK: Mr. Treeger : Hey, cheese!
Ross : Here's the chance. Monica, give him cash.
Ross : Rachel, give him your earrings. Something. Anything!
Monica : No, I will not cave.
Rachel : I'm with Mon.
UNK: All right. You know how you say I never seize the day?
