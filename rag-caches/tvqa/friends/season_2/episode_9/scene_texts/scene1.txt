UNK: Gone!
UNK: Hi, Pooh.
UNK: Hi, Gram. What you doing?
UNK: Just updating the phone book.
UNK: Gram?
Phoebe : Can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Grandmother : Sure, sure.
Grandmother : How come?
UNK: Just, you know, to see him.
UNK: Sure. Here.
Grandmother : This is the one of your father in a meadow.
Grandmother : And helping a little boy fly a kite.
Grandmother : And here he is at a graduation.
Grandmother : Another graduation.
Grandmother : Another graduation.
Phoebe : Is this really my father?
Grandmother : Is it really your fa?
Grandmother : Well, of course it is.
UNK: I smell smoke. Maybe because someone's pants are on fire!
UNK: In all the years we've been grandmother and granddaughter...
UNK: ...you've never lied.
UNK: All right, that's not your father. It's a picture of a guy in a frame.
Phoebe : Oh, God.
Grandmother : It was your mother's idea.
Grandmother : She didn't want you to know your real father...
UNK: ...because he hurt her so much.
UNK: I didn't want to do it.
UNK: But then she died and it was harder to argue with her.
Grandmother : Not impossible, but harder.
UNK: All right. So he's not a famous tree surgeon?
UNK: And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Grandmother : Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
Phoebe : That makes no sense.
Phoebe : Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
UNK: Honey.
Grandmother : Anyway, that's all I know.
UNK: That...
Grandmother : ...and this.
UNK: This...
Grandmother : ...is the real him.
Chandler : I remember my father all dressed up in the red suit...
