Richard : You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.
Richard : See, in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
UNK: Exactly!
UNK: God, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.
Monica : Tell me the truth.
UNK: Don't you like having everything on your desk perpendicular?
Richard : If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Monica : - Very good. - Thank you.
Monica : Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.
Richard : You're gonna do what to my clocks?
Monica : Set them to my time.
Richard : I'm confused.
Richard : I thought we shared time.
Monica : No. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
Monica : Wanna know why?
Richard : Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?
Monica : Forget it.
UNK: No, come on, tell me.
Monica : - You don't understand. - Come on.
UNK: You don't have any obsessive things.
Richard : No, that's not true.
Joey : Oh, yeah? Tell me one of yours.
Richard : One of my things is I always separate my sweat socks...
Richard : ...from my dress socks.
Monica : What if they get mixed up?
Richard : Boy, I would just...
Richard : I would freak out.
Monica : You would not.
Monica : I can't believe this. I hate this. You're too normal.
UNK: I can't believe you don't have a "thing."
UNK: My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing."
Richard : See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
