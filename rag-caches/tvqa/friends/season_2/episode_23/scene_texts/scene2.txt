UNK: Sorry!
Phoebe : I am scary!
UNK: The lightening was an unfortunate coincidence.
Ryan : You look lovely! Lovely!
Phoebe : I hate this.
Phoebe : I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.
UNK: And everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
UNK: I've spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men...
Ryan : ...thinking about this moment.
Ryan : I am not gonna let a bunch...
Ryan : ...of itchy spots stand between us.
UNK: Okay. This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Chandler : - How's the first day? - Good. It's like you said.
UNK: It's putting numbers from one column into another.
Monica : There you go.
UNK: And everybody's nice. I just had a good talk with that lady Jeannie.
Chandler : Jeannie? The head of East Coast operations, Jeannie?
Joey : Turns out our kids go to the same school.
UNK: Yeah. Small world, huh?
Chandler : Weird world.
Chandler : Your kids?
Joey : I figure my character has kids.
Chandler : There isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Joey : When you're acting, you need to think about that stuff.
Joey : My character, Joseph the processing guy...
Joey : ...has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.
Joey : Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Chandler : Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
UNK: You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.
Monica : You know what?
Joey : Just did.
Chandler : That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
UNK: You Know what makes the itching worse?
Phoebe : That you don't stop talking about it?
Monica : - Fine. - Let's just play, okay?
UNK: Good, okay.
Phoebe : Here we go, double sixes.
Phoebe : Here we go...
Phoebe : Here we go...
Phoebe : Come to Mama. Getting ready to roll the dice...
Richard : What are you doing? Are you scratching?
Phoebe : No. This is what I do for luck, okay?
Ryan : You're scratching.
Ryan : Give me the dice.
Ryan : - Give me the dice. - No! Here. There!
UNK: Look, double sixes!
UNK: We can't scratch. We'll scar.
Phoebe : I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard.
UNK: I wanna grab these houses and rub them all over my body.
Chandler : - No! - Give it!
Monica : Come on!
Phoebe : You know you want it. You know you want it too.
Phoebe : Let's just be bad. It'll feel so good.
Monica : Come on.
Ryan : Oh, God, help me.
Joey : - Oh, yeah. - Okay, good. Now do me.
Phoebe : Do my back. Oh, come on. Harder!
Monica : There you go.
UNK: - Don't move. - Why?
UNK: - Don't move. - What are you...?
Rachel : Stop that. Stop that right now.
UNK: I might've expected this of Phoebe. But, Ryan, you're a military man.
UNK: She make me doing.
UNK: - That's a nice color on you. - You will become pink and blunch baby.
UNK: I hope you get a Winnie pork.
Joey : You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Bring the kids.
Joey : We'll make a day of it.
Jeannie : That sounds lovely. We'll have to set it up.
Jeannie : I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: - Bye-bye, Jeannie. - Bye-bye, Joseph.
Joey : What a phony.
Chandler : You'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.
Chandler : - Hey, Mr. Douglas. - Sir.
UNK: Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna see the report until next Friday?
UNK: My group wants to spend the holiday with family.
UNK: Mr. Douglas : I have a family. I'm gonna be here.
Joey : Yeah, Bing. What's that about?
UNK: It's about cutting them a little slack for morale.
UNK: Look, I can get some rough numbers by Wednesday.
Chandler : Rough numbers?
UNK: This company wasn't built on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?
UNK: Mr. Douglas : Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Chandler : If you say so, sir.
Joey : Joseph's good, isn't he?
Chandler : I'm going to kill you.
UNK: Hey, I just figured Joseph's the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.
UNK: You know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
UNK: Why?
Joey : Look, I'm sorry, but that's what Joseph does.
UNK: Okay? If you try to pull something...
Joey : ...he'll call you on it.
UNK: "What are you trying to pull?" He'll say.
UNK: [scene : Duct tape.
Richard : Was I supposed to bring something too?
Monica : This is for the scratchy twins. I taped oven mitts to their hands.
Richard : You're strict.
UNK: Well, it's for their own good.
