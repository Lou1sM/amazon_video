Joey : - Mr. Douglas is looking for you. - Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
UNK: He suspects you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Chandler : Why? Why does he suspect that?
Joey : At first, he thought it was Joseph...
Joey : ...but after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.
UNK: - Anyway, I thought you should know. - All right. That's it.
Chandler : Look, Joey...
Chandler : ...I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you...
Chandler : ...and if I could just fire Joseph, I would. But that's not possible.
UNK: So I have to let you both go.
UNK: What? Everybody loves Joseph.
Chandler : I don't. I hate Joseph.
UNK: I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
Joey : You can't fire Joseph. He's not in your department.
UNK: All right, okay. So I can't fire Joseph...
Chandler : ...but I can sleep with his wife.
UNK: Not Karen!
UNK: Yeah, I'm thinking about having an affair with her.
Monica : You know what?
Chandler : I just did.
Joey : What the hell are you doing?
UNK: Oh, it's not me.
Chandler : It's my character!
UNK: Chandie.
Chandler : The rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives...
Chandler : ...and then laughs about it.
Chandler : In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer!
Monica : - Really? - No, freak show, she's fictional!
Joey : Take it easy.
Joey : If it means that much to you, I'll go find something else.
Richard : Thank you.
Joey : It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.
