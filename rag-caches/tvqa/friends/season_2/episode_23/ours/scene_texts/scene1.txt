UNK: I'm sorry, I never had them.
Ryan : If I had one wish, I'd go back to when I was 7...
UNK: ...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox, and rub that kid all over my face.
UNK: Yeah, or you could wish that I didn't have them now.
Ryan : Can I please see your face?
UNK: No. You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.
UNK: It could be lox, I wouldn't care.
Phoebe : And you hate fish.
UNK: So sweet. All right.
UNK: Okay, all right. You can see.
Phoebe : This is me.
