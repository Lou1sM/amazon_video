UNK: Okay. This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Chandler : - How's the first day? - Good. It's like you said.
UNK: It's putting numbers from one column into another.
Monica : There you go.
UNK: And everybody's nice. I just had a good talk with that lady Jeannie.
Chandler : Jeannie? The head of East Coast operations, Jeannie?
Joey : Turns out our kids go to the same school.
UNK: Yeah. Small world, huh?
Chandler : Weird world.
Chandler : Your kids?
Joey : I figure my character has kids.
