Rachel : This lipstick looks just great on you.
Monica : You look fabulous. You really do.
Phoebe : Yeah, are you sure? Really?
Rachel : See, you look beautiful. For God sakes, dim the lights.
Phoebe : I'm hideous!
UNK: It's gonna be okay.
UNK: Ryan's been underwater.
UNK: He's just gonna be glad you don't have barnacles on your butt.
Phoebe : Come in.
Ryan : Hey, baby, I'm back
Phoebe : Hey, Ryan. What's up?
UNK: What's going on?
Chandler : No, no. You have to stay back.
Phoebe : I have the pox!
Ryan : Chicken or small?
Phoebe : Chicken, which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
UNK: - Why aren't you home in bed? - My grandmother's never had chickenpox.
UNK: Please tell me you have, because oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.
UNK: I'm sorry, I never had them.
Ryan : If I had one wish, I'd go back to when I was 7...
UNK: ...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox, and rub that kid all over my face.
UNK: Yeah, or you could wish that I didn't have them now.
Ryan : Can I please see your face?
UNK: No. You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.
UNK: It could be lox, I wouldn't care.
Phoebe : And you hate fish.
