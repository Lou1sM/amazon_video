Monica : - What. - No, no, no now in all seriousness,
UNK: Best Man : its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight
UNK: Best Man : and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!

Rachel : Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
Ross : Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
Rachel : Oh dear God.
UNK: Ross,
Ross : uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.
Ross : And, uh, for the record
Ross : she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.
Ross : What are you doing I'm serious.
Ross : Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him
Ross : which incidentally worked out pretty well for me
