UNK: All right, mister.
Susie : Let's see those panties.
UNK: Alrighty.
UNK: But you know what would be even sexier?
UNK: What?
Susie : If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
UNK: All right. Now, I would like to see you wearing nothing but them.
Susie : Take your clothes off.
Chandler : I hope you realize this means we'll miss hearing about the specials.
UNK: Come on, hurry!
Chandler : Do you want this done quick or done right?
UNK: All right, turn around. I wanna see you from behind.
Susie : Somebody's been doing his Buns of Steel video.

Susie : I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!
UNK: That was in fourth grade! How could you still be upset?
Susie : Call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
Chandler : I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back!
Ross : I can't believe this.
UNK: Just two weeks ago, I was watching Sudden Death...
UNK: ...and now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Monica : Can you beat up that guy?
Monica : - Can you beat up that guy? - Sure.
Monica : This is so wild.
UNK: I gotta admit, I was surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
UNK: Van Damme : Normally, I would not do it.
Monica : What made you make the exception for me?
UNK: Van Damme : Rachel told me...
UNK: Van Damme : ...you were dying to have a threesome with me and Drew Barrymore.
UNK: Van Damme : By the way, Drew has some ground rules and...

Phoebe : Let's play.
UNK: What'll you do?
Rachel : Give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Monica : You don't have the guts.
UNK: Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy he was cute.
Phoebe : Stop! Stop the madness!
Phoebe : This is crazy!
UNK: Who can remember why you're fighting in the first place?
Phoebe : Yes, that's right.
Phoebe : But still...
