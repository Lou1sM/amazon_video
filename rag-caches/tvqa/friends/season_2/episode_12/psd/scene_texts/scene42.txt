Chandler : Stick a fork in me...
Chandler : ...I am done!
Phoebe : Stick a fork what?
Chandler : Like when you're cooking a steak.
Phoebe : I don't eat meat.
UNK: How do you know vegetables are done?
UNK: Well, you don't. You eat them and you can tell.
UNK: Okay, then eat me, I'm done!
Chandler : I've met the perfect woman.
Chandler : We're sitting on her couch, fooling around...
UNK: ...and then she turns to me and says :
UNK: "Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"
Monica : What did you say?
Chandler : I believe my exact words were...
UNK: How do you know if you wanna do that?
Phoebe : You just know.
Susie : We gotta go. Got a reservation in 30 minutes.
Chandler : What I had planned shouldn't take more than two, three minutes, tops.
UNK: Two hundred seconds of passion! We gotta go.
UNK: But...
Susie : ...here's an idea.
Susie : Have you ever worn women's underwear?
UNK: Well, yes, actually...
Chandler : ...but they were my Aunt Edna's.
Chandler : And there were three of us in there.
Susie : I was thinking it would be kind of sexy...
Susie : ...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.
