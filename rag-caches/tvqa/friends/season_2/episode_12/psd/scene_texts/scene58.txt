Joey : - Are you naked in there? - Well, not exactly.
UNK: I'm wearing panties.
Joey : You always wear panties?
Chandler : No, no. This is the first time.
Joey : Talk about your bad luck!
Joey : The first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Chandler : I was not trying them out. Susie asked me to wear them.
Erica : Let me see!
Chandler : No! I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever!
UNK: All right, all right!
