Rachel : What a jerk!
Rachel : I kept talking about you, and he kept asking me out.
Rachel : Naturally, you know, I said no.
Monica : Thanks, anyway.
Rachel : He just kept asking...

Monica : If you want to go out with him, you can.
UNK: Sounds like a jerk to me, but
Rachel : Jean-Claude, she said yes! I'll see you tonight!
Phoebe : Thank you.
