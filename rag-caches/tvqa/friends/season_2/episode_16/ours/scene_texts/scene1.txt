UNK: Okay, Rach.

Phoebe : Foghorn Leghorn!
UNK: Tattoo Artist : Blonde girl? You're in room two.
UNK: Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.
Phoebe : Here we go!
Phoebe : You're not going.
UNK: Is this because of what Ross said?
Rachel : - Well, yeah, maybe. - I don't believe this.

UNK: Mr. Geller : He told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.
UNK: Mr. Geller : He told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Friend : - Really? - I've never seen him this happy.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : So, Jack...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : ...ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Of course not.
UNK: Mr. Geller : With you, it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Oh, Jack, stop!
UNK: Come on!
UNK: Mr. Geller : It's my birthday!
Joey : Can we drop this?
Joey : I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Chandler : Oh, please. I saw the way you were checking out his moldings.

Joey : ...that I don't need a roommate.
Chandler : I don't need a roommate either.
Chandler : I can afford to live here by myself.
Chandler : I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
UNK: Why are you getting so bent out of shape?
UNK: We didn't agree to live together forever.
Joey : We're not Bert and Ernie.
UNK: I am awared that we are not gay parpens.
Monica : You know what?
Chandler : If this is the way you feel...
Chandler : ...then maybe you should take it.
Joey : - That's how I feel. - Then maybe you should take it!
Joey : Maybe I will!
Chandler : - Fine with me! - Great!
UNK: You can spend more quality time with your real friends...
Joey : ...the spoons!

Monica : Nothing. I just heard something nice about you.
UNK: Really?
