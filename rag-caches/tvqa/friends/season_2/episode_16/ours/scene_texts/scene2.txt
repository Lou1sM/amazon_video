UNK: Mrs. Geller : - Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he? - Not that I know of.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
Richard : That's an idea.
Monica : Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
UNK: Oh?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : She never tells us anything.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
Ross : Mom, there are so many people in my life.
UNK: Some are seeing people and some aren't.
Ross : Is that crystal?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : So who's the mystery man?
Monica : Well, he's a doctor.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : A real doctor?
Monica : No, a doctor of meat.
Monica : Of course he's a real doctor.
Monica : And he's handsome.
Monica : And he's sweet, and I know you'd like him.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Well, that's wonderful.
UNK: Mom, it's okay.
Richard : It is, Judy.
UNK: Jack!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Could you come in here for a moment?
UNK: Now!
UNK: Mr. Geller : - Found it! - I'll take that, Dad.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
UNK: Mr. Geller : That's impossible. He's got a twinkie in the city.
Monica : I'm the twinkie.
UNK: Mr. Geller : - You're the twinkie? - She's not a twinkie!
UNK: Look, this is the best relationship I've been in
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Oh, please! A relationship?
Monica : Yes, a relationship!
Monica : For your information, I'm crazy about this man.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
UNK: This is a good thing. You said you've never seen Richard happier.
UNK: Mr. Geller : When did I say that?
Monica : Upstairs in the bathroom, right before you felt up Mom!
UNK: Happy birthday to you
UNK: Happy birthday to you
UNK: Happy birthday, dear Jack
UNK: Happy birthday to you
UNK: It looks so good! Oh, I love it.
