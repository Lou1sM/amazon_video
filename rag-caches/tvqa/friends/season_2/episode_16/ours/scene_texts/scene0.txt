Joey : Man, this is weird.
UNK: Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?
Chandler : That's what's weird?
Chandler : The man's been captain of a cereal for 40 years.
UNK: What?
Chandler : The spoon! You licked and you put.
Chandler : You licked and you put.
Joey : Yeah, so?
Chandler : Don't you see how gross that is? It's like you using my toothbrush!
Chandler : You used my toothbrush?
UNK: Only because I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Chandler : Mine is the red one!
Chandler : Oh, God! Can open. Worms everywhere!
Joey : Why can't we use the same toothbrush...
Joey : ...but we can use the same soap?
Chandler : Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
UNK: The next time you shower...
Joey : ...think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
UNK: The One Where Joey Moves Out
Phoebe : Look at you fancy lads!
Phoebe : What's the occasion?
UNK: You know that guy on my show that's in a coma?
UNK: He's having a brunch.
Rachel : Ready when you are.
UNK: I can't believe you're actually getting tattoos.
Chandler : You guys are getting tattoos?
UNK: But you cannot tell Ross because I wanna surprise him.
Joey : Wow, this is wild! What are you gonna get?
Phoebe : I'm getting a lily.
UNK: For my mom, because her name's Lily.
Chandler : That's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
UNK: - Where you getting it? - On my shoulder.
UNK: What?
Ross : What's on your shoulder?
Phoebe : A chip.
UNK: I've got a big attitude problem.
Phoebe : - A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo. - A tattoo?
UNK: Why? Why would you wanna do that?
Rachel : You don't think they're kind of cool?
Ross : No. Sorry, I don't.
Ross : Why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
Ross : What if it doesn't come out right?
UNK: It's like having a bad haircut all the time.
UNK: Why is everyone staring at me?
UNK: Sign this card for Dad. Richard will be here soon.
UNK: Richard's going to the party too?
Monica : He's my parents' best friend. He has to go.
UNK: So is today the day you'll tell them about you two?
UNK: Yeah, for my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Phoebe : No, I think you should tell them.
UNK: I don't know how serious he is. Until I do, I won't say anything.
Ross : I don't think Mom and Dad would mind.
Ross : Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, Dad said...
UNK: ..."God, I hope they get together."
Ross : Shall we?
UNK: Okay, wait.
Monica : You know what?
UNK: Ross, let's switch places. You get in the middle.
Monica : This looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Ross : You could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
Ross : We're here!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : - Hi, kids! - The children!
Monica : - Happy birthday, Dad. - Thank you.
Monica : Happy birthday!
UNK: So you kids thanked Dr. Burke for the ride?
Ross : Actually, Mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
UNK: So you kids take the train in?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Friend : Speaking of whom...
Friend : ...I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Monica : Finger cramp! Oh, God!
Monica : Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.
UNK: So Richard's shopping in the junior section?
Monica : Are we still on that?
UNK: You just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
UNK: She's probably not even pretty.
Friend : Just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Joey : Can you believe this place?
Chandler : I know. This is a great apartment.
UNK: In the bathroom there's mirrors on both sides of you.
Joey : When you're in there, it's like peeing with the Rockettes.
UNK: Well, there's my fantasy come true.
UNK: Seriously.
UNK: We were just saying, great apartment!
UNK: Joey's Co-star : Thanks. You want it?
UNK: I'm moving to a bigger place.
UNK: You should take this one.
Joey : Can you see me in a place like this?
UNK: Joey's Co-star : Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings?
UNK: Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.
Chandler : That's all right, I saw a kitchen this morning.
Chandler : On TV.
UNK: Stop talking. Okay!
UNK: - Come on, tell us! - Is she really 20?
Richard : I am not telling you guys anything.
UNK: Come on, it's my birthday. Let me live vicariously!
Ross : Dad, you really don't want to do that.
UNK: Mr. Geller : What's a little midlife crisis between friends?
