Rachel : You didn't get it?
UNK: Joey's Co-star : Why not?
Phoebe : I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
UNK: How could you do this to me? This was your idea!
UNK: I know! I was gonna get it, but he came in with this needle.
UNK: And did you know they do this with needles?
Rachel : Really? You don't say?
Rachel : Because mine was licked on by kittens!
UNK: Serially, does it hurt a lot.
UNK: No, it's just like a pinch like that.
UNK: That's really hurt me, that's gonna leave a mark.
Joey : I'm sorry about what
Chandler : - Yeah, me too. - I know.
Chandler : Do we need to hug?
UNK: No, we're all right.
UNK: So I got you something.
Chandler : Plastic spoons!
Chandler : - Great! - Lick away, my man!
