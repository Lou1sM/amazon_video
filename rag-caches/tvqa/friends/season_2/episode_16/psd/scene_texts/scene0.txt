Joey : Man, this is weird.
UNK: Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?
Chandler : That's what's weird?
Chandler : The man's been captain of a cereal for 40 years.
UNK: What?
Chandler : The spoon! You licked and you put.
Chandler : You licked and you put.
Joey : Yeah, so?
Chandler : Don't you see how gross that is? It's like you using my toothbrush!
Chandler : You used my toothbrush?
UNK: Only because I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Chandler : Mine is the red one!
Chandler : Oh, God! Can open. Worms everywhere!
Joey : Why can't we use the same toothbrush...
Joey : ...but we can use the same soap?
Chandler : Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
