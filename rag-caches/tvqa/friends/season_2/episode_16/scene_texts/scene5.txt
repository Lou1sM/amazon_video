Monica : So are you sorry that I told them?
Richard : No. It's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Monica : Did you get it?
Rachel : - Is Ross here? - He went out for pizza.
UNK: Okay, really quick.
Monica : That's great!
Richard : Very tasteful.
Phoebe : Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?
Rachel : What? You didn't get one.
UNK: Okay. Well then, what is this?
Richard : What are we looking at?
Richard : That blue freckle?
Phoebe : That's my tattoo.
Rachel : That is not a tattoo. That is a nothing.
UNK: I got her in the chair...
UNK: ...he barely touched her with the needle, she screamed and that was it.
UNK: Okay, hi!
Monica : For your information, this is exactly what I wanted.
Phoebe : This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen from a great, great distance.
Phoebe : It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Rachel : Oh, what a load of crap!
Rachel : That is a dot!
UNK: Your mother's in heaven going, "Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"
Rachel : That is not a tattoo! This is a tattoo!
Ross : You got a tattoo?
UNK: Maybe.
Rachel : But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world!
UNK: Well, let me see.
UNK: Well?
Ross : Well, it's really...
UNK: ...sexy.
Ross : I wouldn't have thought it would be, but...
UNK: ...wow!
UNK: Really?
Ross : So is it sore? Or can you do stuff?
Rachel : I guess.
Ross : Save us some pizza.
UNK: Get it out of the corner!
Joey : Pass it! Pass it!
UNK: Stop talking to your men!

Chandler : Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.
Chandler : We'll be over there all the time.
Chandler : Except when we are here.
Phoebe : I know you're just moving uptown, but I'll really miss you.
Monica : How can you not be across the hall anymore?
UNK: Who's gonna eat all of our food and tie up our phone lines
Rachel : Is that my bra?
UNK: - What are you doing with my bra? - It's not what you think.
UNK: We used it to fling water balloons off the roof.
UNK: Remember? Those kids couldn't even get theirs across the street.
Chandler : Yeah, I remember.
Ross : Let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
Chandler : You want me to...
Chandler : ...give you a hand with the foosball table?
Joey : You keep it. You need the practice.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: So...
Joey : ...I guess this is it.
Chandler : Yeah, right.
Chandler : I guess so.
UNK: When am I gonna see you?
Chandler : I'm guessing tonight at the coffeehouse.
UNK: Right. Yeah. Okay.
Joey : Take care.
UNK: Hey, dad. What are you doing here.
UNK: I just stop by your boyfriend to get a piece of my mind.
UNK: [scene : - And. - And I was got a punch on the nose.
UNK: But he has the game on, so we started to watch it.
UNK: Then we have time, and came to find out what for.
UNK: - But he offered me a beer, you know what? - What?
UNK: He got on tap.
UNK: When he in this apartment, the damn thing is build right on his part.
UNK: Did you talk about me?
UNK: Oh, right, actually, we never got to you.
UNK: look, you are a big girl. I just hope you know what you are doing.
UNK: I do. Dad, you wear the tie I got you.
UNK: Where did you get the hat?
Ross : I don't know.
