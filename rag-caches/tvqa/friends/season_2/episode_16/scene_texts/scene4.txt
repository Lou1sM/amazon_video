Chandler : - Yeah, me too. - I know.
Chandler : Do we need to hug?
UNK: No, we're all right.
UNK: So I got you something.
Chandler : Plastic spoons!
Chandler : - Great! - Lick away, my man!
Joey : These will go great in my new place till I get real ones.
UNK: What?
Joey : I can't use these forever. They're no friend of the environment.
UNK: No, I mean what's this about your new place?
UNK: I'm moving out, like we talked about.
Chandler : I didn't think that was serious.
UNK: You know, I thought that was just a fight.
Joey : Well, it was a fight...
Joey : ...based on serious stuff, remember?
Joey : About how I never lived alone or anything?
UNK: I think it would be good for me. Help me to grow...
UNK: ...or whatever.
Chandler : Well, there you go.
Joey : Hey, are you cool with this?
UNK: I don't wanna leave you high and dry.
Chandler : I've never been lower or wetter.
Chandler : I'll be fine. I'll just turn your...
Chandler : ...bedroom into a game room.
Chandler : Put the foosball table in there.
Joey : Why do you get to keep the table?
Chandler : I did pay for half of it.
Joey : I paid for the other half.
Chandler : I'll tell you what. I'll play you for it.
UNK: All right, you're on.
Joey : I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
UNK: Your men will get scored on more times than your sister.
Joey : Which sister?
