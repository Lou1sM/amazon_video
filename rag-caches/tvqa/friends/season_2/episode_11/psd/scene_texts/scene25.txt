Monica : You guys?
UNK: Remember when I said that I don't need your help?
UNK: Actually, I think you said...
Rachel : ..."Don't touch that and get out of my kitchen."
Monica : Really? Weird. Anyway...
UNK: I planned really well. I planned and planned.
UNK: I just didn't plan enough time to do it.
Rachel : - You want some help? - If you want.
Phoebe : What a day!
Phoebe : I took her everywhere.
Phoebe : The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center...
UNK: ...the Statue of Liberty.
Rachel : She's still with you?
UNK: Yes. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.
Phoebe : Be right back. She has to go to the bathroom again.
