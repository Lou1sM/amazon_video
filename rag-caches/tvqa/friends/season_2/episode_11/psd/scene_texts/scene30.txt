Monica : Got my little happy helpers.
UNK: That's fine. Whatever.
UNK: What's wrong?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: Okay, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Monica : You're still gonna pay me, right?
Monica : Or something a little less selfish.
Ross : What's the matter? What happened?
UNK: My parents called to say they weren't coming.

Carol : ...they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away.
UNK: Susan and I fought because I said maybe we should call it off.
