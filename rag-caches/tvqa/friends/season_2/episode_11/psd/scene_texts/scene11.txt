UNK: And when her spirit left her body...
Phoebe : ...I don't think it went very far.
Rachel : What do you mean?
Phoebe : I think it went into me.
Monica : This is so hard.
Monica : I can't decide between lamb or duck.
UNK: Well, lambs are scarier.
Chandler : Otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the Ducks.
UNK: Okay, who ordered what?
Ross : I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Chandler : And this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Rachel : Oh, God.
Joey : You're so uptight about your mom coming.
UNK: I know. I just don't want her to think that because...
Rachel : ...I didn't marry Barry my life is total crap.
UNK: Talk about crap, just listen to Stella Neidman...
