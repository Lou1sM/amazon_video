UNK: Okay, here's his diaper bag...
Ross : ...and his Mr. Winky.
UNK: And...
Ross : ...him. Hi!
Carol : - How did everything go? - Great!
Ross : There was a projectile...
Ross : ...throwing up incident, but he started it.
Carol : We've gotta go.
Carol : Oh, right.
Carol : I've got some news. It's about us.
Ross : You and me?
Carol : No. Susan and me.
UNK: The other "us."
Carol : We're getting married.
Ross : As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
Carol : We'd like you to come. We understand if you don't want to.
Ross : Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Carol : I just thought that
Ross : Why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me...
Ross : ...if I couldn't revel in your joy?
UNK: And I'm reveling, baby! Believe me!
Susan : Is your finger caught in that chair?
Carol : Want us to go?
UNK: This is cool. You're actually on television.
Rachel : I know. It really hit me last night.
UNK: I'm on Days of our Lives.
UNK: Then I started thinking about us, and how these are the days of our lives.
UNK: Yes!
UNK: What?
Monica : Carol and Susan's caterer had a bike accident...
Monica : ...and she's in a full-body cast.
UNK: They want me to do it, which is cool since I've never catered...
UNK: ...and I need the money. Is this a problem for you, isn't it?
Ross : - Would it matter? - You're so great!
Monica : Thank you!
UNK: - You're really not going? - I'm really not.
Ross : They already live together. Why do they need to get married?
Monica : They love each other.
Monica : They wanna celebrate that love with the people close to them.
Ross : If you wanna call that a reason.
Chandler : Who's the bitterest man in the living room?
Chandler : The bitterest man in the living room?
Chandler : Hi, neighbor.
Monica : - I thought you were over this. - That has nothing to do with it.
UNK: She is my ex-wife, If she were marrying a guy, you wouldn't expect me to go.
Ross : If she were marrying a guy, she'd be the worst lesbian ever.
Rachel : Did I miss it?
Joey : No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Chandler : She's pretty.
Joey : And she's really nice.
UNK: She taught me about how to work with the cameras...
Joey : ...and smell-the-fart acting.
Rachel : - I'm sorry, what? - Excuse me?
Joey : Smell-the-fart acting
Joey : You got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes...
Joey : ...you need a minute to remember your next one.
UNK: So while you're thinking...
Joey : ...you take this big pause where you look all intense.
Joey : Like this...
Joey : Here's my scene! Here's my scene!
Joey : Mrs. Wallace?
Joey : Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
UNK: Is she going to be all right?
Joey : I'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected.
UNK: Your sister's suffering from a...
Joey : ...subcranial hematoma.
Joey : Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.
UNK: Nice!
UNK: For a minute, I thought you were actually smelling something.
Ross : - Do it again! - All right!
UNK: - That was so good! - Do it again.
UNK: "Damn it, Braverman! It's right there on the chart!"
Chandler : I gotta get to work. I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
Ross : No, that's me.
Carol : Oh, right.
UNK: Oh, thanks. Couldn't...
UNK: Is everything okay?
UNK: No.
Phoebe : One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Ross : Oh, my God!
Chandler : That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
UNK: She was, you know, 82 years old...
UNK: ...and her name was Mrs. Adelman.
Monica : Oh, honey.
UNK: It's just so strange. You know...
Phoebe : ...she probably woke up this morning and thought...
UNK: ...I'll have some breakfast, take a walk, then have my massage.
UNK: Little did she know God thought, "Okay, but that's it."
UNK: Oh, but the weirdest things was...
Phoebe : ...I was cleansing her aura when it happened.
UNK: And when her spirit left her body...
Phoebe : ...I don't think it went very far.
Rachel : What do you mean?
Phoebe : I think it went into me.
Monica : This is so hard.
Monica : I can't decide between lamb or duck.
UNK: Well, lambs are scarier.
Chandler : Otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the Ducks.
UNK: Okay, who ordered what?
Ross : I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Chandler : And this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Rachel : Oh, God.
Joey : You're so uptight about your mom coming.
UNK: I know. I just don't want her to think that because...
