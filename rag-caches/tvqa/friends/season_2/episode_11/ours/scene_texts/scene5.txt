Carol : I don't know what to do.
Ross : I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Carol : You do?
UNK: Do you love her? And don't be too emphatic about this.
Carol : Of course I do.
Ross : Well then, that's it.
Ross : If George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.
Ross : If my parents didn't want me to marry you...
UNK: ...no way that would've stopped me.
Ross : Look, this is your wedding.
Monica : Do it.
Carol : You're right. Of course you're right.
Monica : So we're back on?
Monica : We're back on.
Monica : You heard the woman! Peel! Chop! Devil!
Joey : Can't believe I lost two minutes!
Joey : It just seems so futile.
Joey : You know? All these women, and nothing!
Joey : I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?
Joey : I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Chandler : Well, now you understand how I feel every single day.
Chandler : The world is my lesbian wedding.
UNK: Butterscotch?
UNK: Mrs Green : No one?
UNK: Mrs. Wallace : All right, you'll be sorry later.
Monica : - Thank you. - Anytime.
UNK: Ross.
Minister : Nothing makes God happier...
Minister : ...than when two people, any two people, come together in love.
Minister : Friends, family, we're gathered here today...
Minister : ...to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Ross : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : Now I've seen everything!
Phoebe : She's gone!
Phoebe : She's gone!
Phoebe : She's gone.
Phoebe : Go ahead, get married. Go, go!
UNK: Strangers in the night
UNK: Exchanging glances
UNK: Wondering in the night
Monica : Would you look at them?
Ross : Yeah. Can't help but.
Joey : How's that pig-in-the-blanket working out for you?
Joey : I wrapped those bad boys.
Phoebe : I miss Rose.
Chandler : Oh, yeah?
Phoebe : I know it's kind of weird, but she was a big part of my life...
UNK: I don't know, I feel alone.
UNK: You know, I couldn't help overhearing what you just said.
UNK: I think it's time you forget about Rose, move on with your life.
UNK: How about we get you a drink?
UNK: Okay. So nice!
Chandler : I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Rachel : Hey, Mom, having fun?
UNK: Mrs Green : Am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman.
UNK: Mrs Green : And three other girls made eyes at me over at the buffet.
UNK: Mrs Green : I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue...
UNK: Mrs Green : ...but it's nice to know I have options.
Rachel : There's more alcohol, right?
UNK: How you doing?
Susan : You did a good thing today.
Susan : You wanna dance?
Ross : No, that's fine.
Susan : Come on.
Susan : I'll let you lead.
Chandler : Look, penis, schmenis!
UNK: Okay? We're all people.
UNK: Which one of us is gonna be the first one to get married?
Ross : Mon, I was married.
Phoebe : - Yeah, me too, technically. - I had a wedding.
Monica : Just trying to start a discussion.
UNK: Which one do you think will be the last to get married?
Chandler : Isn't Ben in this?
Chandler : Of course!
UNK: Absolutely.
