Monica : Joey, speed it up!
Joey : I'm sorry! It's the pigs! They're reluctant to get in the blanket!
Phoebe : How did this happen? I thought you had this planned out.
Monica : Do you want me to cry?
Monica : Is that what you want?
Monica : Do you wanna see me cry?
Phoebe : Sir, no, sir!
Monica : All right, you!
Ross : No. Look, I told you, I am not a part of this thing.
UNK: Look, Ross. I know you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.
Monica : But if you don't help, I'm gonna take those hot dogs...
UNK: ...and create an appetizer called "Pigs In Ross."
UNK: All right, ball a melon!
Chandler : How come I'm stuck dicing when he gets to ball a melon?
Carol : - How's it going? - Great! Right on schedule.
Monica : Got my little happy helpers.
UNK: That's fine. Whatever.
UNK: What's wrong?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: Okay, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
Monica : You're still gonna pay me, right?
Monica : Or something a little less selfish.
Ross : What's the matter? What happened?
UNK: My parents called to say they weren't coming.
Carol : I knew they were having trouble with this, but...
Carol : ...they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away.
UNK: Susan and I fought because I said maybe we should call it off.
UNK: She said, "This isn't for them. It's for us."
Carol : And if I couldn't see that, we should cancel the wedding.
