Phoebe : Do you wanna sit?
UNK: No, I spent most of my morning trying to stand up.
UNK: Mr A : What can I do for you, my dear?
UNK: Okay, I don't know how to say this, but...
Phoebe : I think when your wife's spirit left her body...
Phoebe : ...it kind of stuck around...
Phoebe : ...in me.
UNK: Mr A : You're saying my wife is in you?
UNK: Yeah. You don't have to believe me, but...
Phoebe : ...can you think of any unfinished business she had?
UNK: Any reason to hang around?
UNK: I don't know what to say.
UNK: All I can think of is that...
UNK: ...she used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
Carol : - Everything? - Everything.
Phoebe : That's a lot of stuff.
UNK: Mr A : Oh, wait, I...
UNK: Mr A : I remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
Rachel : I'm sorry. There's laughing in my head.
UNK: Mr A : Worth a shot, huh?
Monica : Look at this!
