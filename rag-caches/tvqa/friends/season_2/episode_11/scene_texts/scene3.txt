UNK: These are all Halloween, three years ago.
UNK: My little martini. I love your olive head.
UNK: Oh, and look, here's Barry.
UNK: He came straight from the office?
UNK: Mr A : Oh, no. That was his costume.
Rachel : See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
UNK: He thought that was really funny.
Monica : You guys?
UNK: Remember when I said that I don't need your help?
UNK: Actually, I think you said...
Rachel : ..."Don't touch that and get out of my kitchen."
Monica : Really? Weird. Anyway...
UNK: I planned really well. I planned and planned.
UNK: I just didn't plan enough time to do it.
Rachel : - You want some help? - If you want.
Phoebe : What a day!
Phoebe : I took her everywhere.
Phoebe : The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center...
UNK: ...the Statue of Liberty.
Rachel : She's still with you?
UNK: Yes. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.
Phoebe : Be right back. She has to go to the bathroom again.
Phoebe : Such a pretty face!
UNK: Oh, this is so much fun! Just the girls!
UNK: Do you know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
UNK: God!
UNK: Did I have to ask do we have pot.
UNK: Look, no one's smoking pot around all this food.
UNK: Well, that's fine.
UNK: Mrs Green : I never did it. I just thought I might.
UNK: Mrs Green : What's new in sex?
UNK: Mrs Green : What's new in sex?
UNK: The only man I've been with is your father.
Monica : I'm dicing. I'm dicing. I don't hear anything.
UNK: Mrs Green : This is no offense to your dad, but I was thinking...
UNK: Mrs Green : ...there might be more.
Rachel : You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you.
UNK: Mrs. Wallace : All right.
UNK: You come here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell Daddy.
Rachel : Do you want my blessing? Want me to talk you out of it?
UNK: Then what do you want?
UNK: I guess I figured you would understand.
Rachel : Why on earth would I understand this?
UNK: You didn't marry your Barry, honey.
UNK: But I married mine.
UNK: We're in trouble. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left.
Monica : Move, move, move!
Chandler : I feel like you should have German subtitles.
