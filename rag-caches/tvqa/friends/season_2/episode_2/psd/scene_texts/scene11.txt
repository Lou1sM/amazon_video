Monica : Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
Monica : Joanne, it's not as simple as all that.
Monica : No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Carol : How did we do?
Phoebe : I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.
Ross : I did not freak out.
Carol : - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk.
Ross : It's gross!
Carol : My breast milk is gross?
Susan : This should be fun.
Ross : There's nothing wrong with it.
Ross : I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
