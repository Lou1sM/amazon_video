Monica : That is excellent.
UNK: What's with you? Who did you have lunch with?
Monica : - Judy. - Who?
Rachel : - Julie. - What?
UNK: Jody.
Rachel : You were with Julie?
Monica : When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her...
Monica : ...because she was my brother's girlfriend.
Monica : And then one thing led to another...
Monica : ...and before I knew it, we were...
UNK: ...shopping.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Monica : Wait, we only did it once.
UNK: It didn't meant anything to me!
UNK: Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time.
Monica : Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.
UNK: Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught!
Monica : That is not true!
UNK: So you just happened to leave it in here?
Monica : Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
UNK: Okay, I just have to know one thing.
Rachel : Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
UNK: Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Monica : Hi, who's this?
Monica : Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.
