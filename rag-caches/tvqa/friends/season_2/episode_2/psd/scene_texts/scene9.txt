Joey : It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.
Joey : Bijan for men?
Joey : Bijan for men!
Carol : And this is Funny Clown.
UNK: It's only for after his naps, not before, or he won't sleep.
Ross : We've been through this before. We have a good time.
Ross : We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Susan : Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.
Susan : Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Rachel : This is so cute!
Susan : I got that for him!
UNK: "My Mommies Love Me."
Ross : That's clever.
UNK: Oh, hi, Jul...
Monica : Hi, Jew!
UNK: Okay, sure.
Monica : That'd be great. See you then. Bye.
UNK: Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?
Monica : Yes, I did.
Monica : That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
Monica : Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Phoebe : Ben, dinner!
Ross : Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
UNK: Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk.
Phoebe : I think I know how to heat breast milk.
Chandler : What did you just do?
Phoebe : I licked my arm, what?
Ross : It's breast milk!
UNK: So?
Rachel : Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.
Joey : What is the big deal?
Chandler : What did you just do?
UNK: Can people stop drinking the breast milk?
Phoebe : You won't even taste it?
Phoebe : Not even if you just pretend it's milk?
Ross : Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Monica : - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been?
Monica : Just out.
Monica : Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me.
Monica : - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem.
Rachel : You can borrow it, by the way.
UNK: Here are your keys, honey.
Rachel : If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?
Monica : You know what probably happened?
UNK: Someone stole my credit card.
UNK: And put the receipt back in your pocket?
Monica : That is an excellent, excellent question.
