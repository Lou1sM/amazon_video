UNK: Oh, hi, Jul...
Monica : Hi, Jew!
UNK: Okay, sure.
Monica : That'd be great. See you then. Bye.
UNK: Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?
Monica : Yes, I did.
Monica : That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
Monica : Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Phoebe : Ben, dinner!
Ross : Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
UNK: Did you microwave that? You can't do that to breast milk.
Phoebe : I think I know how to heat breast milk.
Chandler : What did you just do?
Phoebe : I licked my arm, what?
Ross : It's breast milk!
UNK: So?
Rachel : Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.
Joey : What is the big deal?
Chandler : What did you just do?
UNK: Can people stop drinking the breast milk?
Phoebe : You won't even taste it?
Phoebe : Not even if you just pretend it's milk?
Ross : Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Monica : - Where is everybody? - At the park. Where have you been?
Monica : Just out.
Monica : Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me.
Monica : - Thanks for your jacket. - No problem.
Rachel : You can borrow it, by the way.
UNK: Here are your keys, honey.
Rachel : If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?
Monica : You know what probably happened?
UNK: Someone stole my credit card.
UNK: And put the receipt back in your pocket?
Monica : That is an excellent, excellent question.
Monica : That is excellent.
UNK: What's with you? Who did you have lunch with?
Monica : - Judy. - Who?
Rachel : - Julie. - What?
UNK: Jody.
Rachel : You were with Julie?
Monica : When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her...
Monica : ...because she was my brother's girlfriend.
Monica : And then one thing led to another...
Monica : ...and before I knew it, we were...
UNK: ...shopping.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Monica : Wait, we only did it once.
UNK: It didn't meant anything to me!
UNK: Rachal, I was thinking of you the whole time.
Monica : Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.
UNK: Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught!
Monica : That is not true!
UNK: So you just happened to leave it in here?
Monica : Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
UNK: Okay, I just have to know one thing.
Rachel : Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
UNK: Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now.
Monica : Hi, who's this?
Monica : Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.
Monica : Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
Monica : Joanne, it's not as simple as all that.
Monica : No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Carol : How did we do?
Phoebe : I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.
Ross : I did not freak out.
