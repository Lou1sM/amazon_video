UNK: Hey, what are you guys doing?
Chandler : We're just hanging out by the spoons.
UNK: Ladle?
UNK: Will you guys grow up?
UNK: This is the most nature beautiful thing in the world.
Joey : Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it.
UNK: This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.
Ross : If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions.
Ross : Carol's fine with it.
UNK: Carol?
UNK: I'm wondering, could Joey ask you a question about breast-feeding?
UNK: Sure.
Joey : Does it hurt?
Carol : It did at first, but not anymore.
UNK: Chandler?
Chandler : So, how often can you do it?
Carol : As much as he needs.
UNK: Okay, I got one, I got one.
Joey : If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Julie : - Any muffins left? - Yeah, I forget which ones.
UNK: You're busy, I'll get it.
UNK: - Anyone else want one? - No, thanks.
UNK: You're losing your apron. Let me get it.
Julie : - There you go. - Thank you.
Rachel : What a bitch!
UNK: I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting...
Julie : ...and he wants to abuse his discount.
Julie : Anyone want to come take advantage of it?
Phoebe : I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Monica : - I'll go with you. - Great.
Ross : - Hi, honey. - Hey, sweetums.
UNK: And hello to the rest.
Joey : You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel?
UNK: Will it be a problem?
Chandler : You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie.
UNK: It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Phoebe : Monica, she will kill you.
Phoebe : She will kill you like a dog in the street!
Ross : So Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow.
Monica : It's actually not that big a deal.
Ross : It's a big deal to me. This is great.
Ross : I really appreciate this.
Monica : You're welcome.
Joey : Bijan for men?
Joey : Bijan for men?
Joey : - Hey, Annabel. - Hey, Joey.
Annabelle : Did you hear about the new guy?
Annabelle : Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man."
UNK: Hombre?
UNK: What's he doing in my section?
Annabelle : I guess he doesn't know.
Joey : Well, he's gonna.
UNK: I'll see you a little later, okay?
UNK: Hey, how you doing?
UNK: Mornin'.
Joey : Listen, I know you're new...
UNK: ...but it's understood that everything...
Joey : ...from young men's to the escalator is my territory.
UNK: "Your territory"?
Joey : - Bijan for men? - No, thanks.
UNK: Hombre?
Guy : Yeah, all right.
UNK: Hombre Man : You were saying?
Monica : Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
UNK: We shopped and we had lunch.
Phoebe : What did I have?
Monica : - You had a salad. - No wonder I don't feel full.
UNK: Hi. What's up?
Phoebe : I went shopping with Monica and I had a salad.
Rachel : Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Phoebe : We went shopping for...
UNK: For...
Phoebe : For fur.
Rachel : You went shopping for fur?
Phoebe : And then I realized that I'm against that.
Phoebe : So then we bought some...
UNK: Boobs.
Rachel : You bought boobs?
UNK: Bras!
Phoebe : We bought bras!
Phoebe : We bought bras.
Joey : Bijan for men?
Joey : Bijan for men?
Joey : Bijan for...
Joey : Hey, Annabel.
UNK: I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee?
UNK: Actually, I sort of have plans.
UNK: You ready, Annabel?
Annabelle : You bet.
Annabelle : Maybe some other time.
Joey : It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.
Joey : Bijan for men?
Joey : Bijan for men!
