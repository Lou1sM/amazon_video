UNK: Howdy.
UNK: Give me a box of juice.
Joey : Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Chandler : Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
UNK: Or this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.
UNK: This guy goes through two bottles a day now.
Chandler : What do you care?
Chandler : You're an actor. This is your day job. It's nothing!
Joey : I know, but I was the best.
Joey : You know? I liked being the best.
UNK: Maybe I should get out of the game.
Joey : They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Chandler : Say you do that.
UNK: Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar.
UNK: Then where you gonna run?
Joey : You're right.
UNK: I say you show him what you're made of. Stand your ground.
Chandler : Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie!
