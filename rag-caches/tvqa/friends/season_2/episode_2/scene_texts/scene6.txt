Joey : - I'm gonna do it! - All right!
Chandler : Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
UNK: I don't know what to say.
UNK: That's good because I'm not listening.
Monica : I feel terrible. I really do.
Monica : I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?
Monica : Say that I'm friends with her. Is that so terrible?
Monica : - It's that terrible? - You don't get it!
Rachel : It's bad enough she stole the guy...
UNK: ...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with.
Rachel : But now...
Rachel : ...she's actually...
Rachel : But now she's actually stealing you!
Monica : What are you talking about?
Monica : Nobody could steal me from you.
Monica : Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.
Monica : You're my...
Monica : And we're...
Monica : - Oh, I love you! - I love you too!
Phoebe : You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me.
Phoebe : But I love you guys too!
Phoebe : I really needed that.
UNK: I know that right now...
Monica : ...you really need to hate Julie's guts.
Monica : But she didn't do anything wrong.
UNK: She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.
UNK: I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
UNK: Will you give it a chance?
Joey : For me?
Rachel : I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Rachel : I'd do anything for you!
Phoebe : Wait, wait, wait!
UNK: Mornin'.
Joey : I said, mornin'!
UNK: I heard you.
UNK: Store Guy : All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors.
UNK: Store Guy : You boys ready?
UNK: Ready.
Joey : Yeah, I'm ready.
Customer : You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
UNK: You've blinded me! I'm suing!
UNK: Store Guy : Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do?
UNK: Sorry. I'm such a doofus!
UNK: Hombre Man : I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Annabelle : My God, what happened?
Joey : These new kids, they never last.
Joey : Sooner or later they all...
UNK: ...stop lasting.
Joey : What do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: I just thought we should hang out.
Rachel : I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
Rachel : I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us.
Monica : I know.
Julie : I probably shouldn't even tell you this...
Julie : ...but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Me?
Julie : Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Julie : Ross is so crazy about you...
Julie : ...and I really wanted you to like me, and I...
UNK: It's probably me just being totally paranoid...
UNK: ...but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Rachel : Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Rachel : When you and Ross first started going out...
Rachel : ...it was really hard for me...
UNK: ...for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now.
Rachel : I see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.
Rachel : And Monica's always saying how nice you are...
Rachel : ...and God, I hate it when she's right!
UNK: Thanks.
Julie : Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Rachel : Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Julie : I'd love it too.
Julie : Shoot, I gotta go.
Julie : - So I'll talk to you later. - All right, Julie.
Rachel : What a manipulative bitch.
UNK: It's not bad.
