Carol : - Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk.
Ross : It's gross!
Carol : My breast milk is gross?
Susan : This should be fun.
Ross : There's nothing wrong with it.
Ross : I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Chandler : Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.
UNK: Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal.
Carol : Just taste it.
Ross : That would be no.
Ross : - Come on. - Try it.
UNK: It's natural.
Phoebe : It doesn't taste bad.
UNK: Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like...
UNK: Like what?
Susan : Cantaloupe juice.
UNK: Exactly.
Ross : You've tasted it.
Ross : You've tasted it.
Ross : Oh, you've tasted it.
Susan : You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
UNK: Give me the bottle.
UNK: Get me the towel.
