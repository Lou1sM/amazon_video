Chandler : Why don't you ask him yourself? This is my new roommate, Eddie.
UNK: Nice to meet you.
Joey : - Likewise. - How you doing?
Joey : I'll take that.
Joey : It's what I came for.
Joey : This is new. Where'd you two meet?
Eddie : At the supermarket in the ethnic food section.
Eddie : I helped him pick out a chorizo.
UNK: We got to talking. He needed a place, and I had a spare room.
Joey : Now it's a spare room?
Chandler : Well, yeah. In that it's not being used...
Chandler : ...and I have it to spare.
Joey : Well, I got what I came for.
Joey : I'll see you.
UNK: Hey, Joe.
UNK: When'd you start using moose in your hair?
Eddie : Is this guy great, or what?
Joey : Yeah, he is.
Monica : I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is he?
UNK: Eddie. He just met him.
Rachel : It'll never last. He's just a rebound roommate.
UNK: Check it out! Check it out!
UNK: It's "Smelly Cat," the video!
UNK: Now, I haven't seen it yet, so if you don't like it...
Phoebe : ...so what? None of you ever made a video.
UNK: Get out of here, cat! You stink!
UNK: Smoking!
UNK: Look at me!
UNK: Smelly cat, smelly cat
Phoebe : What are they feeding you?
UNK: Smelly cat, smelly cat
Phoebe : It's not your fault
Phoebe : Smelly, smelly, smelly Really bad smelling smelly cat
Phoebe : It's not your fault
UNK: Smelly cat, smelly cat
Phoebe : - Oh, my God! - I know.
Phoebe : I sound amazing!
Monica : They won't take you to the vet
Chandler : You're obviously not their favorite pet
UNK: Smelly cat, smelly cat
Phoebe : It's not your fault
Phoebe : I've never heard myself sing before.
Phoebe : I mean, except in my own head.
Phoebe : This is so cool! Now I can hear what you hear!
UNK: Pretty different, huh?
Phoebe : I am sorry, but I'm incredibly talented!
UNK: Smelly cat, smelly cat
Phoebe : It's not your fault
UNK: What's going on, man?
UNK: Eddie.
UNK: Morning.
Joey : I just came by to pick up my mail.
Joey : - Where's the mail? - Over there on the table.
Joey : You don't keep it on this table anymore?
UNK: Eddie likes it over there.
UNK: All right, here you go, my friend. Eggs a la Eddie.
Monica : That's great.
UNK: What?
UNK: I thought you liked your eggs...
Joey : ...with the bread with the hole in the middle, a la me!
Chandler : I do, but Eddie makes them this way. They're pretty darn good.
UNK: Will you try some, there are some extra.
Eddie : - No, thanks! - All right.
Eddie : Well, you guys...
UNK: ...I'm out of here.
UNK: See you, pals.
Joey : See you.
UNK: - How are you two getting along? - I couldn't be happier.
UNK: Great.
UNK: I'm happy for you.
UNK: All right, that's it!
Joey : He just comes in here, Mr. Johnny New Eggs...
UNK: ...with his moving the mail and his "See you, pals."
Joey : And now there's no juice!
UNK: There's no juice for the people who need the juice. I need the juice!
UNK: There's another carton there.
Joey : This isn't about juice anymore, all right, man?
UNK: All right.
Chandler : So what's it about?
UNK: Eggs!
UNK: Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine?
Chandler : - Well, I like both eggs equally. - Oh, come on!
UNK: Nobody likes two eggs equally. I wanna know which one you like better.
Chandler : What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore.
Chandler : You took your eggs and you left!
UNK: Did you expect me to never find new eggs?
UNK: Maybe this is not about the eggs.
UNK: Maybe it's about the chicken that lay them.
UNK: What chicken, there is no chicken.
UNK: I can't talk to you.
Monica : I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
UNK: Tough. We're watching Predators of the Serengeti.
Rachel : Would you guys stop!
Monica : It's my TV!
Ross : - Quit it! - Bite me!
UNK: Monica keeps changing the channel.
Monica : That's great. Why don't you tell Mommy on me?
