UNK: So what do you think?
Joey : Casa de Joey.
Joey : - I decorated it myself. - Get out!
Monica : Wow, Joey, this is...
UNK: [scene : - Art. - Art it is.
Ross : Check this out! Is it a coffee table?
Ross : Is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Rachel : Hey, nice pillow.
UNK: So tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
UNK: Hey, excellent water, table thing.
UNK: Thanks. I love this. But you know what?
UNK: It makes me want to pee.
UNK: Yeah, me too. I think that's the challenge.
UNK: How come Chandler didn't come?
UNK: It's because he had a thing with the...
Ross : ...with the thing.
UNK: Right. I got it.
UNK: So why don't you show us the rest of your casa?
UNK: The best part! Come on.
Rachel : Nice toilet.
Joey : No, no, no. Behind it.
Ross : - You have a phone in here? - That's right.
Joey : I have a phone.
Ross : In here.
Monica : Joey, promise me something.
Monica : Never call me from that phone.
UNK: The One Where Eddie Moves In
UNK: Okay, here we go.
Rachel : Sorry, they were all out of apple pie. Someone just got the last piece.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! You won't believe this!
Phoebe : I have just been discovered.
Chandler : Wait a minute. I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
UNK: Anyway.
UNK: Don't freak out and say how great this is until I'm done.
Phoebe : I just met this producer of this teeny record company...
Phoebe : ...who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound...
Phoebe : ...and she wants to do a demo of "Smelly Cat."
UNK: Okay, I told you not to do that yet.
Phoebe : And she wants to do a video.
UNK: I'm not done yet, okay?
UNK: God!
Phoebe : If that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
Phoebe : I'm done now.
Rachel : If you care about me, get the pie out of the man's hood.
Ross : - Get the what? - There's a pie in the hood. Go!
Guy : What are you doing?
Rachel : I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.
UNK: I have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants...
Ross : ...and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
UNK: Damn it, Ross! Get your butt out of the bathroom!
UNK: Calm down. I'm blow-drying.
UNK: Blow-drying what? You have no hair.
UNK: What's going on?
Monica : Your boyfriend has been in there for an hour!
Monica : It's like I'm living with him again.
UNK: He's here when I go to sleep and wake up and when I want to shower.
UNK: I feel like I'm 16 again.
UNK: Well, you're not 16. You're both adults now.
UNK: Get out, you doofus!
Phoebe : Or, you know, he's rubber and you're glue.
Ross : All yours.
Monica : I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Monica : Shut up!
Monica : Cut it out!
Rachel : I've never wanted you more.
UNK: - Lui. Where is Howard? - He went home.
UNK: He said he might stop by after a shift.
UNK: He said he tell you he don't feel so good.
UNK: Hey what time do you get off?
UNK: I'm not feel too good either.
UNK: So what do you say, boys? Should I call him?
UNK: You know what they say :
Chandler : Ask your slippers a question...
Chandler : ...you're going crazy.
Chandler : I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
