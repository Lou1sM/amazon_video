Ross : No, there is no way he was a velociraptor.
UNK: Look at the cranial ridge, okay?
Ross : If Dino was a velociraptor, he'd have eaten the Flintstones.
UNK: Were you taking a nap?
Monica : I was.
UNK: Tony, can you hold on? That's the other line.
Ross : Yeah, she's here, but can she call you back?
UNK: Okay, thanks.
Ross : Call Joanna.
Monica : Did she leave a number?
Ross : Did you see me write one down?
Monica : I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Ross : She'll call back. Don't be such a baby.
Monica : You're the baby.
Ross : - Get off my back. - Get out of my face.
Ross : Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.
UNK: Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.
Ross : Tony, can I call you back?
Ross : That's my sister's boyfriend.
Monica : Give me that.
UNK: Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave my diaphragm at your place?
Monica : Hi, Mom.
UNK: So how's the palace?
Joey : It's funny you should mention that because I was thinking...
Joey : What's with the boxes?
Chandler : Actually, I have some news.
UNK: Is that Joey guy gonna pick up his moose hat or should I toss it?
