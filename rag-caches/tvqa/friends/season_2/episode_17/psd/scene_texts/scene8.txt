UNK: What's going on?
Monica : Your boyfriend has been in there for an hour!
Monica : It's like I'm living with him again.
UNK: He's here when I go to sleep and wake up and when I want to shower.
UNK: I feel like I'm 16 again.
UNK: Well, you're not 16. You're both adults now.
UNK: Get out, you doofus!
Phoebe : Or, you know, he's rubber and you're glue.
