Ross : Why did you hate me?
Monica : Because you were mean to me...
UNK: ...and you teased me and you always got your way.
Ross : That wasn't fun for you?
Ross : I can't believe you hated me.
UNK: But now I love you.
UNK: And not just because I have to.
UNK: Really?
Ross : You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Ross : I can do that.
Monica : Then I won't have to kill you.
