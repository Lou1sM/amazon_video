Phoebe : ...that everyone gets...
Phoebe : ...how smelly this cat actually is.
Phoebe : Maybe if we could talk about this...
UNK: ...because I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Producer : We can talk.
UNK: It's just that this costs $100 a minute to be in here.
Phoebe : So the cat stinks, but you love it. Let's go.
Ross : No, there is no way he was a velociraptor.
UNK: Look at the cranial ridge, okay?
Ross : If Dino was a velociraptor, he'd have eaten the Flintstones.
UNK: Were you taking a nap?
Monica : I was.
UNK: Tony, can you hold on? That's the other line.
Ross : Yeah, she's here, but can she call you back?
UNK: Okay, thanks.
Ross : Call Joanna.
Monica : Did she leave a number?
Ross : Did you see me write one down?
Monica : I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Ross : She'll call back. Don't be such a baby.
Monica : You're the baby.
Ross : - Get off my back. - Get out of my face.
Ross : Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.
