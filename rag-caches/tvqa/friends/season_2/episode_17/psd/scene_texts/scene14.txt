Chandler : ...- fest!
Joey : Well, great.
Chandler : Yeah, I just...
Chandler : ...wanted to call and say hey.
UNK: Well, okay.
Joey : Was that the oven timer?
Chandler : That's right, my friend.
Chandler : It's time for...
UNK: ...Baywatch!
Joey : Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Monica : I can't believe they made her lieutenant!
UNK: You're saying that because you love Yasmine Bleeth.
Chandler : How could anyone not love Yasmine Bleeth?
UNK: Hey, they're running.
Chandler : See, this is the brilliance of the show.
Chandler : I say always keep them running.
Chandler : All the time running!
UNK: Run!
UNK: Run!
Chandler : Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!
UNK: But you wanted to live by yourself.
Joey : I did. I thought it'd be great.
