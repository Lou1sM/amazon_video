Ross : Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, all right?
Monica : I just can't stand you being here...
Chandler : ...all the time!
Ross : Why? Why can't you stand me being here?
UNK: We're just having fun.
Monica : Fun? You think this is fun?
UNK: I thought we were fooling around, like when we were kids.
Monica : I hated you when we were kids!
Ross : You hated me when we were kids?
Monica : I hated you.
UNK: I loved you in a you're-my- brother-so-I-have-to way...
UNK: ...but basically, I hated your guts.
