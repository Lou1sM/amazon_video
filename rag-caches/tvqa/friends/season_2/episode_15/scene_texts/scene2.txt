UNK: Monica?
UNK: It would help when I'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.
Rachel : Honey, I'm just checking.
UNK: [scene : - Monica? - Mon?
UNK: What?
UNK: Dr. Burke : I'm sorry.
UNK: It's just, when you moved your hands down to my butt...
UNK: ...it was, like, "Whoa! Ross' hands are on my butt!"
UNK: And that's funny. Why?
Rachel : Well, it's not.
UNK: Dr. Burke : I'm sorry. I guess I'm just nervous.
Rachel : I mean, it's you.
UNK: You know, it's us.
Rachel : We're crossing that line. It's sort of a big thing.
UNK: Well, I know it's big. I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.
UNK: Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.
Rachel : I know, I know, I know!
UNK: I was thinking about when they were there the last time.
Rachel : I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, look! I promise.
UNK: I won't laugh anymore. Put your hands back there.
UNK: No, see, now I can't.
UNK: - I feel self-conscious. - Come on, touch my butt.
Rachel : Just one cheek
Ross : The moment's gone.
UNK: - I'll back up into your hands. - That's romantic.
Rachel : - Touch it. - No.
Rachel : - Oh, come on, squeeze it. - No!
