UNK: Oh! Right. Okay.
UNK: Ole!
UNK: What?
Phoebe : The Matador...
UNK: Ole!
UNK: Sweetie, can you hold this for a second?
Chandler : Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.
Chandler : But it's gone now. You're all right.
Ross : Hi, everyone.
Ross : I wanted to thank you for our little talk before.
Rachel : No problem! So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?
Ross : I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
UNK: Good. What did he say?
Ross : He told me to get over myself and just do it.
UNK: I thought about what you said and about what he said.
UNK: And his way, I get to have sex tonight, so...
UNK: What is this in my pocket?
Chandler : Why, it's Joey's porno movie!
Ross : Pop it in!
UNK: I'm fine, if you're okay watching a video...
UNK: ...filled with two-nippled people.
Rachel : People having sex. That's just what I need to see.
Ross : What's wrong with people having sex?
Rachel : Well, you know, these movies are offensive...
Rachel : ...and degrading to women and females...
Rachel : And the lighting's always unflattering.
Rachel : - Monica, help me out here. - Hell, I wanna see Joey!
UNK: So is there a story? Or do they just start doing it right
Julie : Oh. Never mind.
Chandler : Wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
UNK: All I say is, she'd better get the job.
Ross : Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Joey : Here I come.
UNK: See, I'm coming to fix the copier.
Joey : I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking, "What do I do?"
UNK: So I just watch them have sex.
UNK: Then I say Here's my line!
Joey : You know, that's bad for the paper tray.
Chandler : Nice work, my friend!
Joey : Wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
Joey : There I am. There I am. There I am...
Phoebe : So what's up? You came to see me yesterday.
UNK: I kind of need a divorce.
UNK: O...
UNK: ...kay.
Phoebe : How come?
Duncan : Actually, I'm getting married again.
UNK: What?
Duncan : I don't know how to tell you this.
Duncan : I'm straight.
Phoebe : I don't understand. How can you be straight?
Phoebe : You're so smart and funny...
Phoebe : ...and you throw such great Academy Award parties!
Duncan : That's what I kept telling myself.
UNK: But you reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
Phoebe : How long have you known?
Duncan : I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.
UNK: I thought I was supposed to be something else.
Duncan : I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.
UNK: And there's actually a woman?
Duncan : Her name's Debra.
UNK: Well, is she the first that you've been with?
Duncan : I've never told you this...
Duncan : ...but there were one or two times back in college when...
UNK: ...I'd get drunk, go to a straight bar...
Duncan : ...and wake up with a woman next to me.
Duncan : I told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.
UNK: Sure.
Duncan : Now I know I don't have a choice. I was born this way!
Phoebe : I don't know what to say.
Phoebe : You're married to someone for six years and you think you know him.
UNK: And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay!"
Duncan : I'm still me.
UNK: Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?
Monica : You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
UNK: That saves us the conversation.
Chandler : This has been great, but I'm officially wiped.
UNK: Me too. We should get going.
UNK: No! Come on, you guys!
UNK: Come on, it's only 11 : 30.
Rachel : Let's just talk. We never just hang out and talk anymore.
Monica : Rachel, that's all we do.
Rachel : Maybe that's all we do. What about Julie?
