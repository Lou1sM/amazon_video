Rachel : What about Julie?
Rachel : You have been in our lives for nearly two months now...
Rachel : ...and we don't really know you.
Rachel : I mean, who is Julie?
Rachel : What do you like? What don't you like?
UNK: We want to know everything.
UNK: Well, that could take awhile.
UNK: So?
Rachel : Who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Chandler : I got the time to get to know Julie.
Monica : I know her pretty well. Can I go?
Rachel : That's fine.
Rachel : Let's start with your childhood. What was that like?
Julie : In a nutshell
Phoebe : So, have you told your parents?
UNK: No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.
Duncan : My brother's straight, so...
Julie : Here you go.
Rachel : You know what? I just have one more question.
Phoebe : If you had figured this out sooner, and I had been around...
UNK: ...do you think I would have been the one...?
UNK: No. Don't tell me.
Phoebe : I don't think either answer would make me feel better. Here.
Duncan : I love you, Phoebe.
UNK: So your brother's straight, huh?
UNK: Seriously.
UNK: And my second-grade teacher was Miss Thomas...
UNK: ...and my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Rachel : Mrs. Gobb?
UNK: No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.
Rachel : What exactly is in a cobb salad?
UNK: I'm going home.
Joey : Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?
UNK: Good night.
Rachel : It's pretty late. You're probably not still planning on...
Ross : No, I am.
Rachel : Are you nervous?
Ross : I have done it before.
UNK: I mean, how are you gonna handle it?
UNK: Are you gonna talk about it beforehand? Are you just gonna pounce?
Ross : I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna...
Ross : ...see what happens.
UNK: Good luck!
UNK: What?
UNK: Nothing...
Rachel : It is your first time with her, and if the first time doesn't go well...
UNK: ...well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
UNK: Okay, now I'm nervous.
Rachel : Maybe you should put it off.
UNK: No, I don't want to put it off!
Ross : I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.
UNK: And now I'm actually happy.
Ross : You know, I mean really happy.
Ross : I just don't wanna...
UNK: I don't wanna mess it up, you know?
Duncan : I know.
Phoebe : I'm sorry.
Ross : It's not your fault.
UNK: Right.
Rachel : Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.
Rachel : Maybe you were on the right track with that whole "spontaneous" thing.
Rachel : - Women really like that. - Really?
Rachel : I mean if it were me, I'd want you to...
UNK: I don't know, catch me off guard with a really...
Rachel : ...good kiss.
Rachel : Really sort of soft at first.
UNK: And then maybe brush the hair away from my face.
UNK: And then look far into my eyes...
Rachel : ...in a way that lets me know something...
Rachel : ...amazing is about to happen.
UNK: And then, I don't know, then...
Rachel : ...you'd pull me really close to you so that...
Rachel : ...so that I'd be pressed up right against you.
Rachel : And it would get kind of...
UNK: ...sweaty...
Rachel : ...and blurry.
Rachel : And then it's just happening.
UNK: Thanks, Rach. Good night!
Rachel : Oh, God!
Ross : Good morning!
UNK: Well, somebody got some last night!
UNK: Twice!
