Phoebe : ...and you throw such great Academy Award parties!
Duncan : That's what I kept telling myself.
UNK: But you reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
Phoebe : How long have you known?
Duncan : I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.
UNK: I thought I was supposed to be something else.
Duncan : I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.
UNK: And there's actually a woman?
Duncan : Her name's Debra.
UNK: Well, is she the first that you've been with?
