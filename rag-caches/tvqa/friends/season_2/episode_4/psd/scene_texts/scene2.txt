UNK: Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God...
Rachel : It's open, you guys.
Rachel : Can I help you?
UNK: Does Phoebe still live here?
UNK: No, she doesn't. But I can get a message to her.
UNK: Great. Just tell her her husband stopped by.
UNK: Her what?
Stranger : How did you do that?
UNK: This is unbelievable, Pheebs. How can you be married?
UNK: I'm not "married" married, you know?
Phoebe : He's just a friend, and he's gay...
UNK: ...and he was from Canada, and he needed a Green Card.
Monica : I can't believe you married Duncan!
Monica : How could you not tell me? We told each other everything.
UNK: I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd get judgmental...
