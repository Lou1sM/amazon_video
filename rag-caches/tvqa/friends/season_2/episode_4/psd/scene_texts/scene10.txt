Ross : ...having the sex?
Rachel : Why? Who's not? Are you and Julie not?
Rachel : Are you and Julie not having sex?
UNK: Technically?
UNK: No.
UNK: Is it because she's so cold in bed?
UNK: Or because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?
Ross : No! She's great. And it's not like we haven't done anything.
