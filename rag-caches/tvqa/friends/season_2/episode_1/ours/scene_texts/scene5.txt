Monica : I promise.
UNK: All right, let's see.
Phoebe : Now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.
Phoebe : But I promise, none of you will feel a thing.
Phoebe : - That's it. I quit. - What? I didn't say anything!
UNK: But this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
UNK: This is the face of a person who, you know...
Phoebe : ...doesn't trust a person.
Monica : I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Monica : It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Phoebe : Would you relax? I know what I am doing.
Phoebe : This is how he wears it.
Monica : How who wears it?
Phoebe : Demi Moore.
UNK: Demi Moore is not a "he."
UNK: Well, he was a "he" in Arthur and in 10.
Monica : That's Dudley Moore!
Monica : I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Rachel : Oh, God!
Phoebe : Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
UNK: Which one is Demi Moore?
Monica : She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Phoebe : She's got gorgeous hair.
Ross : I know!
Frankie : How long do you want the cuffs?
Chandler : At least as long as I have the pants.
Frankie : I just got that.
Frankie : Now we'll do your inseam.
Rachel : How is she?
Phoebe : It's too soon to tell.
Phoebe : She's resting, which is a good sign.
Ross : How's the hair?
Phoebe : I'm not gonna lie to you. It doesn't look good.
Phoebe : I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Joey : Can we see her?
Phoebe : Your hair looks too good. It'd upset her.
UNK: Ross, you come on in.
UNK: Well, how you doing?
Rachel : I'm okay.
Joey : That bad, huh?
Joey : Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.
Joey : It's one of my gifts.
UNK: Joey, when I saw him get off that plane with her...
Rachel : ...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.
Rachel : But today, it's like there's rock bottom...
Rachel : ...50 feet of crap...
Rachel : ...then me.
Joey : Tell Ross how you feel.
Rachel : Come on, how can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Joey : What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks.
Joey : Ross has been in love with you for 10 years.
Rachel : I don't know. I don't know.
Joey : I've been with my share of women.
UNK: I've been with a lot of people's share of women.
UNK: But the point is...
Joey : ...I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
UNK: Really?
Chandler : Yo, paisan!
Chandler : Can I talk to you for a sec?
Chandler : Your tailor...
Chandler : ...is a very bad man!
Joey : What are you talking about?
