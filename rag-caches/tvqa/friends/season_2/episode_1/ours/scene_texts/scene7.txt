UNK: Ross, tell him. Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
Ross : Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
UNK: What's the matter with you?
UNK: What?
Joey : That's not?
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Monica : Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Ross : I like it.
UNK: I do. I think it's a 10!
Julie : Thank you.
Monica : My hair is very amused.
UNK: Come on, things could be worse.
UNK: You could "get caught between the moon and New York City.
UNK: I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Julie : Thank you.
Ross : Well, I gotta go. Bye.
Ross : Bye, Rach!
Rachel : Wait, are you leaving?
UNK: That's what I meant by "bye."
Chandler : Can I talk to you for a sec?
Joey : When the doctor does that hernia test...
UNK: That's okay.
UNK: What's going on?
UNK: Well, okay, first of all...
UNK: ...Paolo and I are not back together.
UNK: That was a stupid thing I did.
Rachel : If I could go back in time and do it again...
Rachel : ...well, I wouldn't.
Rachel : Second of all...
UNK: What?
Ross : Is this one of those things where you break up with a guy...
Ross : ...I tell you what I think...
UNK: ...and the next day you get back together with him...
Ross : ...and I look like a complete idiot?
UNK: Well, then, I think the guy's scum.
Ross : I hate him. I mean, I actually I physically hate him.
Ross : I always have.
UNK: And you are way too good to be with a guy like that.
UNK: Really?
Ross : You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you...
Ross : ...and who gets how funny...
Ross : ...and sweet and amazing...
Ross : ...and adorable and sexy you are.
Ross : You know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking :
Ross : "Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"
Ross : You know? Someone who makes you feel good.
UNK: Like the way I do with Julie.
UNK: Was there a "second of all"?
UNK: No, I think that was the whole "all."
Ross : I gotta go.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: No, I swear to God, Dad!
Joey : That's not how they measure pants!
UNK: I was thinking of doing it shorter, like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
UNK: - Yeah, I could do that. - Really?
UNK: - You wanna do it now? - Great!
Ross : See you.
UNK: I just wanna make really sure this time.
UNK: Andie MacDowell is the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
UNK: No.
UNK: That's Roddy McDowall.
UNK: Andie MacDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Julie : - Thank you. - You're welcome.
