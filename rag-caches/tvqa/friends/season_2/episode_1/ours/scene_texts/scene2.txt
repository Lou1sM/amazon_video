UNK: I'm telling U. She went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! This is huge!
Phoebe : This is bigger than huge. This is...
Phoebe : All right, what's bigger than huge?
UNK: This?
UNK: Guys, you got new haircuts!
Chandler : Yes, we did. Thanks to Vidal Buffay.
UNK: Because, you know, "If you don't look good, we don't look good."
Phoebe : I love that voice!
UNK: And the winner is Eva Godna!
Rachel : Airport. Airport. Ross.
Rachel : Not alone.
UNK: Julie.
Rachel : Arm around her!
UNK: Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!
Chandler : I think she's trying to tell us something.
Chandler : Quick, get the verbs.
Rachel : You! You!
Rachel : You said he liked me!
UNK: You!
Rachel : You slowpokes!
Ross : That's all right. We got the bags.
Ross : This is my sister, Monica.
Ross : This is Chandler.
UNK: Phoebe, hi.
UNK: Joey.
Ross : Everyone, this is Julie.
UNK: Julie.
Julie : But I'm not here, you haven't met me.
UNK: I'll make a better impression when I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.
Ross : - And bus. - Oh, my God!
UNK: - With the screaming guy - And the spitting.
Ross : You gotta hear this story.
Julie : We're on this bus that's 200 years old.
UNK: Two hundred, at least.
UNK: And the chicken poops in her lap!
Rachel : I'm so sorry.
Rachel : I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
Rachel : I just heard this story in the cab...
Rachel : ...and it is all I can think about.
Monica : This is amazing.
Monica : How did this happen?
UNK: We were in grad school together.
Ross : We haven't seen each other since then. I land in China...
Ross : ...guess who's in charge of the dig?
UNK: Julie!
Rachel : Isn't that great?
Rachel : Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Monica : It's an expression.
Ross : We just wanted to say a quick hi.
UNK: - Then we'll see the baby. - Then get some sleep.
UNK: It's 6 : 00 tomorrow night, our time.
Chandler : Don't tell us what's gonna happen. I like being surprised.
UNK: Bye!
Ross : - Can I get some coffee? - Sure.
UNK: - Did you talk to him yet? - No.
Rachel : Then, no.
Chandler : What the hell happened to you in China?
Chandler : When last we left you, you were in love with, you know.
Ross : I know I was.
UNK: But there was always this voice inside that kept saying :
UNK: "It's never gonna happen. Move on." You know whose voice that was?
