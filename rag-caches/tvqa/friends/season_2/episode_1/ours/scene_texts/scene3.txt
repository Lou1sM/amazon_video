UNK: God?
Ross : It was you, pal.
Chandler : Maybe it was God doing me.
Ross : You were right. She looks at me and sees a friend. That's all.
UNK: And then I met Julie...
UNK: ...and we're having a great time.
UNK: I never would have gone for it, if it hadn't been for you.
Chandler : Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Rachel : Your lemonade.
UNK: I didn't order it.
UNK: Then go take that back. They'll charge you for that.
UNK: Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
Rachel : So what did you find out?
Chandler : He said...
Chandler : He said...
Chandler : They're having a great time.
Chandler : I'm sorry.
Chandler : But the silver lining, if you wanna see it...
UNK: ...is that he made this decision all by himself...
Chandler : ...without any outside help whatsoever.
UNK: How is that a silver lining?
Chandler : You have to really wanna see it.
UNK: Ironically, these guys were picked last in gym.
UNK: Hey, Pheebs.
Monica : You know what I'm thinking?
UNK: How...
Phoebe : ...it's been so long since you've had sex...
Phoebe : ...you're wondering if they've changed it?
Monica : No. Although now that's what I'm thinking.
Phoebe : So what were you thinking?
UNK: You gave the guys great haircuts. I thought you'd like to do mine.
UNK: No.
Monica : Why not?
Phoebe : Because I'm just...
Phoebe : I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Monica : No, you're not.
Phoebe : I know I'm not, but you are.
Phoebe : I was trying to spare your feelings.
Joey : Hold on.
UNK: Ross, Julie for you.
Chandler : Anybody know a good tailor?
UNK: You need clothes altered?
Chandler : No, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Joey : Go see Frankie. My family's been going to him forever.
Joey : He did my first suit when I was 15.
Joey : No, wait, 16.
UNK: No, excuse me, 15.
Joey : All right, when was 1990?
Chandler : You have to stop the Q-Tip when there's resistance!
Ross : Sweetheart, I'll see you later.
UNK: Okay, bye.
Ross : That is so sweet.
UNK: Okay. No, you hang up.
Monica : No, you
Ross : One, two, three.
Ross : You didn't hang up either.
Rachel : She didn't hang up.
Ross : No, you hang up.
Rachel : You. You.
Rachel : Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
UNK: Rachel.
Ross : I'll just call her back.
UNK: Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry. We got disconnected.
Ross : No, you hang up.
Rachel : How did this happen to me?
Rachel : A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
Rachel : Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
UNK: Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
