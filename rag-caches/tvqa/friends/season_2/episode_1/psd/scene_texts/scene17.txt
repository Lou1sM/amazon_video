Monica : Please, just a little bit off the back.
Phoebe : I'm still on "no."
UNK: Morning.
UNK: Could you close your eyes for a sec?
UNK: No, no, no. I'm not falling for that again.
UNK: What's going on?
UNK: I sort of did a stupid thing last night.
Chandler : What stupid thing did you do?
Rachel : Why don't you just go get dressed...
UNK: ...then you'll be on your way. Bye-bye.
Monica : How did this happen?
UNK: I kind of ran into him last night.
Ross : - Where? - At his apartment.
Rachel : Is this juice?
Joey : And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Rachel : Oh, God, I know. I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
Monica : Honey, you're not pathetic. You're just sad.
Chandler : People do stupid things when they're upset.
Monica : My God, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't
Monica : But this is about your horrible mistake.
Ross : Sorry we're late.
Julie : We were...
Ross : Well, there was touching.
Paulo : Hey, Ross!
Phoebe : What a...
Ross : What are you doing here?
Paulo : I do Raquel!
Ross : So he's back?
Rachel : Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
Ross : No, not a problem.
UNK: Good. Glad it's not a problem.
Phoebe : You're gonna have to not touch my ass.
UNK: Despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension...
UNK: ...my pants need to be altered.
Joey : When you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
Joey : He'll know what it means.
UNK: You sure he'll crack that code?
UNK: It's funny. The last time Paolo was here, my hair was so much cuter.
Phoebe : All right.
Phoebe : But you have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy...
UNK: ...and all Monica about it.
