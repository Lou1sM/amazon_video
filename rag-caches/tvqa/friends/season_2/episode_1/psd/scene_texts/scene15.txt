Rachel : Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
UNK: Rachel.
Ross : I'll just call her back.
UNK: Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry. We got disconnected.
Ross : No, you hang up.
Rachel : How did this happen to me?
Rachel : A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
Rachel : Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
UNK: Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
Rachel : ...this really great guy that I can't have.
