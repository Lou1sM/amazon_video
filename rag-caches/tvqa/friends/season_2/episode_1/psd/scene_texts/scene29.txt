Rachel : ...well, I wouldn't.
Rachel : Second of all...
UNK: What?
Ross : Is this one of those things where you break up with a guy...
Ross : ...I tell you what I think...
UNK: ...and the next day you get back together with him...
Ross : ...and I look like a complete idiot?
UNK: Well, then, I think the guy's scum.
Ross : I hate him. I mean, I actually I physically hate him.
Ross : I always have.
UNK: And you are way too good to be with a guy like that.
UNK: Really?
Ross : You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you...
