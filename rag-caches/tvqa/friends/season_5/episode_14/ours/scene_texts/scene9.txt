Chandler : He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
UNK: It's Chandler. You can take him.
UNK: Come on. Don't you remember when you made him cry using only your words?
Joey : Aren't you guys done yet?
UNK: I want to sit in my chair!
UNK: The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner it's over and out in the open.
Joey : I like that.
Joey : Show him your bra. He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
UNK: You didn't rip off any buttons.
Joey : It's not my first time.
UNK: Go back there and seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler : Give me a second.
Chandler : -Did you clean up in here? -Of course!
Chandler : You're going?
Phoebe : Not without you, lover.
Phoebe : So this is my bra.
Chandler : It's very, very nice.
Chandler : Well, come here.
UNK: I'm very happy we're going to have all the sex.
Phoebe : You should be. I'm very bendy.
UNK: I'll kiss you now.
Chandler : Not if I kiss you first.
Chandler : I guess there's nothing left for us to do but kiss.
Phoebe : Here it comes.
Phoebe : Our first kiss.
Chandler : You win!
UNK: I can't have sex with you!
Phoebe : -And why not? -I'm in love with Monica!
Phoebe : You're what?
Chandler : Love her!
Chandler : I love her!
Chandler : I love her!
Chandler : I love you, Monica.
Monica : I love you too, Chandler.
UNK: I thought you were doing it. I didn't know you were in love!
UNK: Dude!
Chandler : Hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.
UNK: May I say your breasts are still showing.
UNK: God.
Rachel : All right! So that's it?
Joey : It's over. Everybody knows!
Monica : Actually, Ross doesn't.
Chandler : We'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
UNK: Well, here it is.
Ross : A new place for a new Ross.
UNK: I'll have you and the guys from work over, once it's furnished.
UNK: Dr. Ledbetter : It's nice to see you back on your feet.
UNK: I am that, and the whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
UNK: Dr. Ledbetter : I wonder if it's time for you to rejoin our museum team?
Ross : That would be great.
Ross : I am totally ready to come back to work.
Rachel : What are you doing?
Ross : Get off my sister!
