Monica : You are so cute.
Monica : How did you get to be so cute?
Chandler : My grandfather was Swedish.
Chandler : And my grandmother was a tiny little bunny.
Monica : Now you're even cuter.
UNK: You know, that is a popular opinion today, I must say.
Chandler : The weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.
Chandler : Phoebe was hitting on me.
Monica : What are you talking about?
Chandler : I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
UNK: It's not possible.
UNK: I'm sorry, Phoebe's just always thought you were charming...
Monica : ...in a sexless kind of way.
UNK: You know, I can't hear that enough.
UNK: I just think you misunderstood her.
UNK: I didn't, okay? She was all over me.
Chandler : She touched my bicep, for crying out loud.
Monica : This bicep?
Chandler : Well, it's not flexed right now.
UNK: Why is it so hard for you to believe that Phoebe could be attracted to me?
Chandler : It's not.
UNK: All the girls are attracted to you.
UNK: You're part bunny.
