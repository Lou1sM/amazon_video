UNK: -We're out of here. -Why?
Larry : I saw 10 violations. I'm shutting this place down!
Phoebe : -You have the power to do that? -This does.
Phoebe : Shut it down.
Chandler : What are you doing?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: You built a fort, didn't you?
Danny : Kind of.
Chandler : Oh, my God! The air purifier. Ross' air purifier.
UNK: All I heard for four years through college was...
UNK: You should have gone out once in a while.
Chandler : -I hate this thing! -Come on, Chandler.
Joey : Ross is our friend. He needs us right now.
UNK: So why don't you be a grownup and come watch TV in the fort?
UNK: Can't believe that Larry closed down Churman's. I love that place.
UNK: You should have heard about all their violations.
UNK: Larry said that they should call it Vermin's.
UNK: That guy just plain kills me.
UNK: I wanted to invite you to the party.
UNK: Thanks, I'll try to stop by.
Rachel : Actually, I think I'm going to be busy.
Ross : You are?
UNK: Remember, I've got that gala?
Danny : What's the gala for?
Rachel : It's a regatta gala.
UNK: Do you sail?
Rachel : No, but I support it.
UNK: I hope I see you tomorrow night. Take care.
Rachel : Walked right into that one, didn't he?
Monica : What one?
Monica : You wanted him to invite you and he did.
Rachel : He waited until the last minute. So if I said yes...
Rachel : ...he'd know I had nothing better to do than wait for his invitation.
UNK: But I said no...
UNK: ...which puts me back in the driver's seat.
Monica : So the ball is in his court?
UNK: Ball?
UNK: No, there's no ball.
UNK: Hey, Phoebe, you want to join us?
UNK: -Oh, sure, yeah. Where is this from? -It's from Sun Ling's.
UNK: Oh, Larry just told me something about Sun Ling.
UNK: Oh, no, thank you.
Ross : Joey, please.
UNK: Sorry.
Chandler : Hello, children.
UNK: You want to play some foosball? Please?
UNK: We moved the table into my room because of all the boxes.
Joey : Come on!
Joey : I have one question.
Joey : What is the deal with this?
Chandler : Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?
Joey : No, the quiet down thing.
Chandler : You mean this.
Joey : I don't know how much more I can take.
Joey : Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?
Chandler : My God!
Joey : What if that had been porn?
UNK: All right, this may be tough...
UNK: ...but it's Ross. I survived college with him.
