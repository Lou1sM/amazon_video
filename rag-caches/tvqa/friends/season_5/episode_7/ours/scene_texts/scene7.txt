UNK: Bread.
Danny : Aren't you a chef?
Rachel : Right, tonight was your party.
Danny : You look great! I'm glad you made it.
UNK: Well, you know, the gala had to end sometime.
Danny : Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Rachel : Whose court is the ball in now?

Danny : I'm gonna go mingle.
Tom : So you work at Bloomingdale's? My mom calls it "Bloomies."
UNK: At ease, soldier!
Tom : I'm sorry?
Rachel : You can just drop the act. I know what's going on.
UNK: You're Danny's wingman, right?
Rachel : You guys are best buds, frat bros.
UNK: I'm going to go talk to a friend.
Rachel : Yeah, you go talk to your friend.
UNK: Go tell him, "Nice try."

Phoebe : Okay. Go.
UNK: Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Chandler : Here we go, here we go.
UNK: So I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Joey : You're kidding?
UNK: But Phoebe said I could stay at her place for a while, so...
UNK: Well, you can't stay with Phoebe. We're roomies.
UNK: You don't need me taking up all your space.
Joey : We got plenty of space. There's still some by that speaker.
Joey : Please, just stay.
UNK: Are you sure?
UNK: -Definitely. -You have to stay.
Ross : So I'm a pimp, huh?
Phoebe : It's okay.
Ross : Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.
UNK: But just talk to me. Tell me if something bothers you.
UNK: And I'll do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just...
Chandler : Well, I see you've had a very productive day.
UNK: The cowboy hat's a little much.
Ross : Come on, it's fun!
Ross : All right.
Chandler : Isn't this a woman's hat?
UNK: Stop talking crazy, and make us tea!
