Ross : Hey, roomies!
UNK: I love what you've done with the place.
Ross : I know it's a lot of boxes.
UNK: -I appreciate you letting me stay here. -Not a problem.
UNK: Since you'll be here a while...
UNK: ...we could put your name on the answering machine.
Ross : I hope you don't mind...
UNK: ...but I kind of already jazzed it up a little.
UNK: Check it out.
Joey : We will
Ross : We will call you back
Ross : Pretty cool.
Joey : -You're fake laughing too, right? -The tears are real.
