UNK: Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?
Joey : No, look.
Chandler : That's a pig.
Joey : I know. But look at the knobs on it!
Ross : Emily's cousin kicked me out.
UNK: -What? -Why?
UNK: When you sublet from your wife's cousin...
UNK: ...then you divorce, sometimes the cousin wants his apartment back.
Chandler : Didn't you sign a lease?
UNK: Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
Joey : You can stay with us.
Chandler : Anything you need.
UNK: But you have to let us know when you feel better...
UNK: ...so we can make fun of your hair.
Ross : You got it.
UNK: Thanks, I really appreciate this. I'm going to get packing again.
Ross : I've been moving around so much that I feel like a nomad.
UNK: -What? -He thought you said gonad.
