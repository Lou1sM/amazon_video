Joey : I guess I can hold out a little longer.
Joey : Let's have a game.
UNK: Fellas?
Chandler : So he's out of here.
Joey : Got anything to eat? I went to Jono's and it was closed.
UNK: I took Larry there, but it was all violated, so we shut it down.
UNK: If this guy keeps closing our favorite places, where will we eat?
Monica : I don't know. Clean places?
UNK: Yum!
Monica : It's Danny.
Rachel : Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a gala.
Monica : We'll be right there. Can't you say it's later?
Rachel : What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?
Monica : The fake kind.
Danny : -I need a ladle. You got a ladle? -We have a ladle.
Danny : See you at the party.
Phoebe : You know what Larry would say? He'd say, "See you ladle."
UNK: I'm done. You want anything? Sports? International?
Chandler : Apartment listings?
Ross : I'll take sports.
UNK: Mine!
UNK: All right, international.
Joey : That's mine too.
Joey : I'm Italian.
UNK: I could check apartment listings, though there's never anything here.
UNK: Not even on page seven?
Ross : You're right. Here's an affordable place.
UNK: Two-bedroom, close to work. It's available in five weeks.
Chandler : What about that circled one?
Ross : It's kind of expensive for a studio.
Joey : But it's available now.
Joey : Isn't it?
Chandler : Yes, it is.
Joey : Let's go look at it!
Chandler : There we go!
UNK: Guys, would you chip in for some new air filters for the purifier?
Ross : I mean, after all, we are all using it.
Chandler : Let's go quicker!
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: Look at this kitchen/bathroom.
Chandler : That's great! So you can cook while in the tub.
Joey : Somebody was using his head.
Joey : Let's check out the rest of the place.
Ross : I think this is it.
Larry : I don't know. Maybe we should keep looking.
UNK: But this place is available now.
Chandler : You don't want to be stuck with us for five weeks.
UNK: So you think I should take this place?
Joey : It's perfect!
Ross : How about you?
Chandler : Kitchen, slash, bathroom.
Ross : I see what you guys are saying.
Ross : I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Chandler : We are bad people.
Joey : He knew we were trying to get rid of him.
UNK: Could we get a bathtub in our kitchen?
