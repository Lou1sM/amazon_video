UNK: 3B.
Steve : You got your free food. You ruined everyone's fun.
UNK: Isn't it time you went home?
Steve : Go back to 3B, 3B.
Phoebe : Everyone, calm down! I have something that I'd like to say.
Phoebe : Who here likes Ross?
Phoebe : Of course you don't like him.
Phoebe : He didn't give you any money.
Phoebe : He raised his own hand when I asked, "Who likes Ross?"
Phoebe : And he's wearing two nametags.
UNK: I'll be honest. When I first met Ross, I didn't like him at all.
Phoebe : Once I got to know him, I saw that he is really sweet...
Phoebe : ...and caring and very generous.
Phoebe : All I'm saying is, don't judge Ross before you get to know him.
UNK: You know, I like all of you guys now. But when I first met you, you know?
UNK: Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.
UNK: Lola?
UNK: Mind-numbingly stupid.
UNK: You guys. Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.
Phoebe : So I think you all know what I mean.
Phoebe : Obviously, I didn't think they would throw things.
UNK: I thought if I kept insulting them you'd defend them.
UNK: Then you'd look like the hero.
Ross : See, I did not get that.
