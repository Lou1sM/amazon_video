Katie : You were so funny with that waiter. You're such a nut!
UNK: You know, bread-stick fangs are always funny.
Katie : No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Joey : Look, Katie. Listen, we need to talk, okay?
Joey : Look, I like you. I really do. I like you a lot.
Joey : But sometimes when you playfully punch me like that...
UNK: ...it feels like I'm being hit with a very tiny but a very real bat!
Katie : Like I could hurt you.
Katie : Are you making fun of my size?
Katie : Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Monica : Isn't this great?
Monica : Couldn't you just stay like this forever?
Monica : Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Chandler : Yeah, here, somewhere else. You know, wherever.
Monica : Are you okay?
Chandler : I'm cool.
UNK: Casual.
Monica : What are you doing?
UNK: Just hanging out. Having fun with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Monica : Man, I knew it! I knew you'd do this.
UNK: What?
Monica : Get all freaked out because everybody was joking about marriage!
Chandler : Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Monica : You know what I want?
Chandler : Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Monica : I do not have baby fever!
Chandler : You're obsessed with babies and marriage...
Chandler : ...and everything that's related to babies and marriage.
UNK: Why don't we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker!
Monica : Have you lost your mind?
Monica : This isn't about me. This is about you and your weird commitment crap!
UNK: I know you. I know the thoughts that you have in your head.
Monica : You don't know everything.
UNK: Did you know I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you?
UNK: And that the only baby here is you?
UNK: Did you know I can't even look at you now?
Chandler : I did not know that.
UNK: It'll be okay, right? She won't leave me. This is fixable.
UNK: -Yeah, sure. -Absolutely.
Chandler : By me?
UNK: Unless you make some big gesture.
UNK: Big, though.
UNK: The missus!
Monica : Gunther, can I get a coffee?
Joey : To go.
UNK: I still don't want to talk to you.
UNK: Tell me how to make things right.
Chandler : That's what we do.
UNK: I mess up, you tell me how to fix it and I do.
UNK: And then you think I'm cute again.
Monica : I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor.
UNK: Figure this out for yourself.
UNK: If you're afraid of a real relationship...
Monica : ...then don't be in one.
UNK: Howard! Howard! Howard!
