Ross : Hi, Ross!
UNK: What are you doing here?
Phoebe : I thought this was your party, and it's a party for Howard.
UNK: He's the sweetest little man.
UNK: See you, Phoebe. And thanks for chipping in.
Joey : Oh, sure.
Ross : You chipped in?
UNK: Yeah, $100.
UNK: I can't believe you gave him money.
UNK: I thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money.
Phoebe : But they didn't ask me.
UNK: I'm just the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Ross : But you're making me look bad.
UNK: No, I'm not! If anything, I'm making you look better.
Phoebe : They'll see you talking to me. I'm a hit.
UNK: Hey, Phoebe!
Monica : Hey, Ross.
Steve : Maybe you two could switch apartments.
UNK: Because Phoebe is more our kind of people.
UNK: Think about it.
Phoebe : Okay, my bad.
UNK: You look big.
Joey : Thanks, I've been working out.
Joey : Listen, is it obvious I'm wearing six sweaters?
Rachel : But it's not obvious why.
UNK: I'm breaking up with Katie, so I put on some extra padding.
UNK: If she hits me when she is happy, can you imagine how hard she'll hit...
UNK: ...when I take away the Joey love?
UNK: Oh, right. I forgot that you call it that.
Rachel : Hey, cute jacket.
UNK: Thanks.
Katie : -That's so sweet! -Ouch!
Katie : Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys are too much!
Ross : You know what? I gotta tell you...
Rachel : ...I think you're the one that is too much.
Katie : Joey has the nicest friends.
Rachel : And the nicest girlfriend.
Katie : You're so sweet!
Katie : You're so sweet!
Katie : She just kicked me.
UNK: Aren't you going to do something?
UNK: Do something or I'll walk out that door right now.
UNK: Are you going to?
Ross : This is a disaster. Can't I please just go?
Phoebe : I'm talking you up to people.
UNK: Give it some time, relax. Get something to eat.
Ross : What did you tell them about me?
UNK: I told them about you and Emily. Trying to get some sympathy.
UNK: But you came off as the bad guy.
Phoebe : I told it wrong.
Phoebe : We should talk about that because I don't understand what happened there.
Ross : This cake is really good!
Phoebe : Things are looking up.
UNK: Guest #2 : Oh, my God! Someone cut Howard's cake!
UNK: Who would do a thing like that?
