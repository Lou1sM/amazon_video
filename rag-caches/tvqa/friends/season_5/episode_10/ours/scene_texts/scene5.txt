UNK: I don't have brothers, so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle?
Chandler : -Oh, yeah. -All the time.
Monica : In fact, I was undefeated.
UNK: Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
Monica : Still, I was quick as a cat.
Rachel : I met Danny's sister yesterday.
UNK: -That was the girl on the subway. -You're kidding.
UNK: They were very, you know...
UNK: ...wrestle-y.
Rachel : But I guess that's normal?
Monica : We don't wrestle now.
Ross : Not since I got too strong for you.
Monica : Too strong for me?
Monica : You wanna go right now?
Monica : I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Ross : Oh, fine.
UNK: Ready?
UNK: Wrestle!
UNK: Okay, you know what?
UNK: Actually, that helps a lot. Thanks.
Chandler : Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes!
Ross : Joey's not going.
Joey : I didn't finish my five pages.
UNK: Finish them tomorrow.
Ross : Tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Ross : Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
UNK: Cut him some slack. If he relaxes, he'll get some work done.
Ross : I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you...
Ross : ...and Fireball.
Joey : If you think Fireball's relaxing, you've never played.
Chandler : You're doing this because you're bored.
Chandler : It's not his fault you're unemployed.
Ross : I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Joey : Guys, don't fight.
UNK: And I'm doing this because I am Joey's friend.
UNK: If you were a friend, you'd be doing the same.
UNK: So being a friend means being a jerk?
Ross : If it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.
UNK: Let's settle this over a game of Fireball.
UNK: -I'll unhook the smoke detectors. -Let's settle this right now.
Ross : There. Now no one's going to the game.
Chandler : -I paid for those! -You said you would, but you didn't.
Chandler : Oh, yeah.
Danny : We finally get to the top of the mountain...
Danny : ...and airhead here forgets the camera.
Ross : The same thing happened to me one time.
Chandler : When did that happen to you?
UNK: Remember? We were jogging and saw that bird.
UNK: I wanted to take a picture, but I didn't have my camera.
UNK: Chasing the churro guy is not jogging.
Krista : Oh, this is so good. You have got to try it.
Danny : -Damn. I got it on my pants. -Here, I'll get it.
UNK: We better take them off or the stain will set.
UNK: -I want to wear them tonight. -Oh, great.
UNK: Okay, bye. Oh, my God!
Monica : -That was unbelievable. -See? I told you.
UNK: Yeah. Sorry.
Chandler : I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Chandler : They're brother and sister?!
UNK: I guess you'll have to cancel your date.
UNK: And call their mother.
UNK: Wait a minute. Open your hand. Let me take a look.
Phoebe : Quarter, dime. Lint? Not interested in that.
Phoebe : What's this? A Canadian coin?
