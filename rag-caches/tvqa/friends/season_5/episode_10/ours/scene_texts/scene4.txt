Chandler : Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Phoebe : Thank you! Happy holiday.
UNK: No, that's trash, young lady. You can't

Ross : That's it?
Ross : You're supposed to have five pages done by now...
Ross : ...including an exciting incident.
Ross : What is all this? "The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
UNK: That's the game we played.
UNK: It's great. You take a tennis ball, a bowl and lighter
Ross : This is helping your career? You wanted to be an actor.
Ross : Not the creator of "Crazy Lawsuit Game."
Rachel : You're right. I'll get back to work.
Ross : Shame on you! You should know better! Joey needs to work.
Ross : Now come on.
Ross : You can have this back when the five pages are done.

Monica : -You are. -You are.
Monica : -You are. -You are!
Danny : You are so dead.
Danny : I'm gonna get you. Come here!
UNK: It's very nice to meet you.
UNK: Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket!
Phoebe : You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
Phoebe : Does this look like a garbage can to you?
Phoebe : Does it look like an ashtray?
Phoebe : Does it look like a urinal?
UNK: -So you going back out there? -Yeah, but I won't take any more crap.
Phoebe : No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
UNK: Good. You're tough. You lived on the street.
UNK: I'll go back to being Street Phoebe.
UNK: But not totally back. Street Phoebe wouldn't be friends with you guys.
Rachel : Can I ask you guys something?
