UNK: Get out of here!
Phoebe : No drinks near the bucket.
UNK: Set it down there and then you can make a contribution.
UNK: You can leave the "hurt bunny" look over there too.
Phoebe : Hi, Bob.
Phoebe : I thought I told you to get out of here!
Bob : Phoebe, we've been getting complaints.
UNK: We're moving you to a less high-profile spot.
UNK: -Ginger's taking this corner. -That chick can't handle my corner.
Bob : Look, either you leave or we remove you.
UNK: Fine.
Phoebe : I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
UNK: -I thought we said 7. -You know what? Let's skip it.
Danny : What? Why?
Rachel : You and your sister seem to have a very special bond
Rachel : Oh, great. That "special bond" again.
UNK: Why do women have a problem with my being close to my sister?
Rachel : -I don't know, but -Do you have brothers?
Rachel : No, I have two sisters. But one has a very masculine energy.
Danny : -Are you close? -No. They're not very nice people.
UNK: I like you. I think this could go somewhere.
UNK: So I'm close to my family. Don't let it stand in our way.
UNK: Well, I don't know...
Rachel : When you put it that way
Krista : Danny? Hurry up. The bath's getting cold.
Rachel : I'll see you later.
Chandler : There's some kids playing in the street.
UNK: Want to go give them a project, ruin their day?
Ross : If they have a ball, you could stick razors in it...
UNK: ...and teach them a new game : "Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."
Joey : Hey, guys! I was at the library. I already finished my five pages.
Chandler : Now we can go to the Ranger game last night!
Joey : No, dude. Ross tore up the tickets.
UNK: I guess without so many distractions it's easier for you to focus?
UNK: Also without somebody breathing down your neck all the livelong day!
UNK: The important thing is, I finished it. And I think it's really good.
UNK: But it would help if I could hear it. Would you guys read it for me?
UNK: -Yeah, all right. -All right.
UNK: "It's a typical New York apartment.
Joey : Two guys are hanging out."
UNK: "Hey, man."
UNK: "What is up?"
UNK: "About yesterday. I was really wrong. I am sorry."
UNK: "No, it was me. I'm sorry. I overreacted."
UNK: "Maybe it was both of us. But we had our best friend's inter
Ross : But we had our best friend's interest at heart."
UNK: "Could I be more sorry?"
UNK: "I don't know. I am one sorry...
UNK: ...polontologist."
Ross : All right, Joey, we get it.
Ross : -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry too.
Joey : Keep reading. The good part's coming up.
UNK: "I am sorry, Chandler."
UNK: "I am sorry, Ross."
UNK: "A handsome man enters."
UNK: "I don't know what you're talking about, but I'd like to thank you both.
UNK: You. You wouldn't let me give up on myself.
Phoebe : And you.
UNK: You co-created Fireball."
UNK: "The End."
Chandler : This took you all day?
UNK: No, this took five minutes.
Joey : I spent the rest of the day coming up with new Ultimate Fireball!
UNK: It's a typical New York apartment. Two girls are just hanging out. Go.
UNK: -"Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?" -"I'm doing just fine.
UNK: God, Tiffany, you smell so great."
UNK: "It's my new perfume.
Monica : Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?"
Rachel : -Joey, you are sick. -This is disgusting.
Rachel : I'm not reading this.
UNK: Wait, wait, wait! The handsome man was about to enter!
