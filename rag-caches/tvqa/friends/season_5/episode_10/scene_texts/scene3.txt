Joey : I can't believe I didn't get that part.
Ross : I'm sorry, man.
Ross : What you should do...
UNK: ...is make something happen for yourself.
UNK: You know, like write a play.
UNK: Or a movie. What about those Good Will Hunting guys?
UNK: Be realistic, you know? If I did write something...
Joey : ...what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Joey : Wait a second. I could star in it!
Ross : Or that.
Joey : I can't write. I mean, I'm an actor.
UNK: I could act like a writer. Here...
UNK: But see? Nada.
Joey : I don't have the discipline that it takes. I can't do it.
Ross : I'll help you.
Ross : Yeah. I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
Ross : Plus, it'll give me something to do.
Joey : You'd do that for me? Thanks.
UNK: We'll start slow. All you have to come up with tonight...
UNK: ...is the name of your main character.
UNK: -Done. -And it can't be Joey.
Joey : -It's not. -Or Joseph.
Monica : What's up?
UNK: I just saw Danny on the subway with a girl...
Rachel : ...and he had his arm around her.
Monica : Honey, I'm sorry.
Rachel : You should be. This is all your fault.
Rachel : You meddled in our relationship!
Monica : You had no relationship!
Rachel : But I was doing my thing and everything...
Rachel : ...was going according to the plan!
Monica : Oh, God, stop with the plan!
UNK: So what if you saw him with a girl?
Monica : That doesn't mean anything.
UNK: You'll go out with Danny and be so charming he'll forget all about...
Monica : ...that stupid subway girl.
UNK: She was kind of stupid.
Rachel : You're right. I'm just going to go on the date.
UNK: I'm just going to go on the date. That is the new plan.
UNK: Hurry!
UNK: -How do you spell "suspicious"? -Why?
Joey : I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
UNK: Chandler Bing, seven! Chandler Bing, zero!
Joey : You're driving me crazy with that.
Chandler : -I'll stop. -Don't stop.
Joey : Move the bowl further away. Ross could make that shot.
Joey : Well, you suck. But at least you suck at a man's game now.
UNK: -Want to play? -I can't play games.
UNK: Ross'll be home soon. I have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.
UNK: So play for 30 minutes, then write until he gets home.
Ross : All right.
Joey : But listen, what do you say we...
Joey : ...crank it up a notch?
Chandler : I'm intrigued.
Joey : All right. All we need is a little lighter fluid.
Chandler : But be careful. I want our security deposit back.
Joey : We said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.
