Joey : -What are you doing? -I reorganized the fridge.
UNK: See? Bottom shelf, meats and dairy.
UNK: Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.
UNK: And top shelf, expired products.
Joey : Why are you doing this?
UNK: Because I'm bored out of my mind.
UNK: I've already been to the bank, post office and dry cleaners.
Joey : Dude, you just described seven days' worth of stuff.
Joey : Spread it out a little. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
UNK: I'm not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.
UNK: Hey, don't get religious on me, okay?
Joey : A guy in your position needs to be better at relaxing.
UNK: That's why we have comfortable chairs. Here, sit down.
UNK: Ready? Watch.
Chandler : And then...
Ross : -So, what? We just sit? -Oh, no, no.
UNK: We're not gonna just sit. Watch.
Chandler : -Hello, Chandler Bing. -Hello, Mr. Bing.
Joey : I love you.
UNK: All right, whoever this is, stop calling me!
UNK: It's been 6 months! It's not funny!
UNK: I can see you, Mr. Bing.
UNK: You look sexy in your new suit.
Chandler : Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!
UNK: And that's Wednesday.
Phoebe : Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Chandler : The British are coming?
UNK: Oh, you and your ways.
UNK: Since it's Christmas, I'm going to be collecting donations.
UNK: I have my bell and later on I get my bucket.
UNK: I'll be spreading joy to the people.
Phoebe : Last year I spread a little joy, but not enough.
UNK: So this year I'm doing the whole city.
Monica : I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
UNK: It's weird, you're starting to sound a lot like Chandler lately.
UNK: That is so not true.
UNK: So, Phoebe, where are you doing your bell-ringing?
Phoebe : They gave me a great spot right by Macy's.
UNK: They never give a good spot to a rookie...
UNK: ...but I'm the only one who can say "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.
Phoebe : I lied!
UNK: Oh, my God. Here's Danny.
Rachel : Just watch this.
Rachel : See? Still pretending he's not interested.
UNK: He's coming over. Pretend we've forgotten who he is.
Danny : -Hey, guys. -Hey, Danny.
UNK: Oh, Danny! Hey!
UNK: You know Rachel. She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Rachel : Thanks, Mon.
Danny : Of course.
Monica : Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Danny : Absolutely. Is Friday okay?
UNK: Friday is perfect. She can't wait.
Danny : On the date, I'll be able to talk to her directly?
UNK: See you Friday.
Rachel : Okay, what the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me.
Rachel : I have a date with Danny!
UNK: All right, it's 4 : 30, I guess my lunch break is over.
UNK: -What are you guys gonna do? -If you're going back to work...
UNK: ...I'll probably just hang out. You know, make some calls.
