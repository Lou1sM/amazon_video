UNK: Okay, but we're safe, right? Nothing bad's gonna go down.
Gary : No. But that reminds me. Sign this.
Ross : What is it?
UNK: It just says you can't sue if you scrape your knee...
UNK: ...or get your head blown off.
Chandler : Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Gary : Here he comes.
Gary : What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?
Ross : What is it?
Joey : -Is everything okay? -What?
UNK: He sees us. Don't move. And don't look at him!
Gary : Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.
Gary : Hey, look at that. You tried to save your buddy.
Gary : You see that?
Gary : You see what he did?
Joey : You okay, man?
UNK: Thanks, Joey.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Hi.
Monica : You all right?
