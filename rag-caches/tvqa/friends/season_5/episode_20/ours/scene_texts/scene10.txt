UNK: Okay?
Rachel : I was right.
Rachel : Your decision.
UNK: Right.
Ross : I guess I should call Emily.
Rachel : No, that's not the right decision.
Rachel : That's not right.
Rachel : Ross, come on!
Ross : I mean...
Rachel : ...that woman made you miserable!
Rachel : Do you really want to get back into that?
Ross : Okay, look. Yesterday...
UNK: ...I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.
Ross : But my ex-wife calls on the same day...
UNK: ...I have a near-death experience?
UNK: That's gotta mean something.
UNK: That was not a near-death experience. That was barely an experience.
Ross : You weren't there!
Ross : Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?
UNK: Okay. You know what?
Rachel : Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
Rachel : Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
UNK: Okay? Look at today.
UNK: I mean, you escaped...
UNK: ...death.
Rachel : And maybe this is a chance for you to escape...
Rachel : ...getting back together with Emily.
Ross : That does make sense.
UNK: Because I do want to seize some opportunity...
UNK: ...but I really don't want to see or talk to her.
Rachel : Well, there you go!
UNK: Yeah, maybe today's just...
UNK: ..."close call" day.
Ross : Hey, thanks, Rach.
UNK: Oh, honey. No problem.
Rachel : Wait, wait. The message is blinking.
Ross : Maybe you didn't erase it.
Ross : Hey, Ross, it's you
Ross : That's an old message. Nobody needs to hear that.
UNK: -Hey, was Monica here? -Yeah.
Ross : I want my money back.
Rachel : You probably need that for stamps, right?
Ross : Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Phoebe : Yes, once.
Joey : A little.
UNK: He kind of did it to himself.
Phoebe : It's not really a good story.
Ross : I wonder how I'd react under fire. And not backfire...
Ross : ...but heavy fire.
UNK: Like, if I was in a war.
Monica : Man, I would be great in a war!
Monica : I think I'd make a fantastic military leader.
Monica : I mean, I know I'd make general before any of you guys.
Chandler : Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
UNK: I know Joey would be in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Chandler : If the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Joey : Yeah, hero sandwiches.
UNK: You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
UNK: But when the revolution comes, I'll have to destroy you all.
Phoebe : Not you, Joey.
