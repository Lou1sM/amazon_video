Emily : Okay, bye.
UNK: Where we going?
Gary : This witness won't return my calls. We'll surprise him coming home.
UNK: Surprise him? We're not gonna make anybody mad, are we?
Joey : Come on, man.
Joey : You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes a bit before he lawyers up?
UNK: He's a witness, not a perp. And no one talks like that.
Ross : Yeah. No one talks like that.
UNK: -Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop? -I'm more cop than you two.
Chandler : How do you figure that?
Ross : I'm in the front seat, okay?
Ross : I'm Gary's partner.
UNK: When you say "partner," it doesn't sound cop.
Chandler : It sounds gay.
UNK: Jealous.
UNK: -Hey, we're undercover here. -Oh, yeah. No problem.
UNK: -Ross! -Sorry.
UNK: There.
Ross : Hey, Gary. Who am I?
Ross : Phone home.
Chandler : Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Joey : What's up with that, Serpico?
UNK: "What's up with that, Serpico?"
Emily : Are you thinking about me? No, of course you're not.
Emily : But if you are, call me tonight.
Emily : Okay, bye.
