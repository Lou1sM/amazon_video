UNK: No.
Emily : I know!
Monica : Thank God you were here. We have to erase that.
Rachel : What? We can't do that.
Monica : We have to. What if Ross hears that...
UNK: ...and calls her back and they get back together?
Monica : Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling...
Monica : ...neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
UNK: No! Oh, no, no.
Rachel : God, no! He should not get back with her.
Rachel : I know that, you know that. Even Ross knows that.
UNK: But we have no right to erase his message.
UNK: Look, I'm his sister and I love him. I don't want to see him get hurt.
UNK: Doesn't that give me the right to control him?
Monica : Help him?
UNK: He's not the one who needs help.
Monica : She's obviously unstable.
Monica : She's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
UNK: Okay, fine. But look at the position she's putting him in.
UNK: And what's he gonna do?
Monica : Run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?
Monica : Who would do that?
Monica : Okay, fine. All right. But that was different.
Monica : Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
UNK: This is some twisted joke she's playing on him.
Rachel : You are crazy. She sounded genuinely upset.
Rachel : I mean, listen.
UNK: Your messages have been erased.
UNK: No!
UNK: Well, that worked out well. Margarita?
