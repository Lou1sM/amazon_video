Monica : We should go.
Rachel : No, wait.
Monica : Oh, yeah. Right.
Rachel : No. Monica.
Rachel : Monica, we have to fix this.
UNK: What can we do? You erased the message.
UNK: Yeah, but maybe I could call his machine and re-create the message.
UNK: All right, okay...
UNK: Hello, Ross, this is Rachel Emily.
UNK: God, what is it with those two names?
UNK: I do so wanted to say that I'm going to be getting married...
UNK: ...to another British person.
UNK: And I'm having doubts and scones...
UNK: -I can't remember what she said. -Yeah, that's the problem with this plan.
UNK: Rachel, come on. The message is erased, there's nothing we can do.
UNK: He's never gonna find out.
UNK: I could tell him about it.
UNK: If you want to be rational, I can't argue with you.
Monica : All right?
UNK: Fine, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
UNK: Maybe that's Emily leaving the exact same message.
Ross : Hey, Ross, it's you. I just want you to remember this feeling.
Ross : You are lucky to be alive.
UNK: So live every day to the fullest.
Ross : Love yourself, okay?
Ross : And also get stamps. Bye.
Monica : Play that message for Emily, and this problem goes away.
UNK: Right?
Gary : Anybody want to meet a hero?
Phoebe : John Glenn is here?
Gary : No. Joey.
UNK: Joey's never been in outer space.
Ross : We had the most incredible night.
Ross : -We're in the car -Wait. Hold on.
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
Gary : Okay, go ahead.
UNK: So we're in the car, and bang! A shot was fired.
Ross : And Joey, with no regard for his own safety...
Ross : ...throws himself on me.
Phoebe : My God!
Chandler : It was a car backfire.
Ross : But he didn't know that.
Joey : Yeah, I didn't know that.
UNK: It could just as easily have been a bullet.
Gary : Ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Chandler : Who jumps at loud noises.
UNK: Wow. I could have died tonight.
Chandler : Yeah, if the car that backfired had run over you!
UNK: I'm gonna go home, before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Ross : I do have a newfound respect for life.
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: Ross, I could have told you you weren't gonna die today.
UNK: What? You know when I'm gonna die?
UNK: -You want to get some dinner? -Sure.
UNK: You know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
UNK: Maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Bye.
Joey : Cut it out.
UNK: I'd hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day.
UNK: Why'd you take off?
UNK: Just going for a walk.
Chandler : Around the living room, whatever.
Joey : -Is something wrong? -No. No, I'm just tired.
UNK: You know, from the walk.
Chandler : You dove in front of Ross!
UNK: Ross!
