UNK: Okay, but it is officially nighttime.
UNK: -Want me to grab the berry for you? -It's called a cherry.
Gary : It's called Chandler!
Joey : Okay, I got it.
Joey : This place makes the best sandwich in the world.
Gary : Does it have meatballs?
Joey : Oh, yeah.
Gary : Melted cheese and marinara sauce?
UNK: Yep.
Gary : You can't eat that in my car.
Joey : Yeah, okay.
Joey : Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Chandler : Your tax dollars?
Joey : Yeah, okay.
UNK: Wow, that sandwich smells good.
Joey : Did I say you could smell it?
UNK: I can't smell it?
Joey : Half the taste is in the smell. You're sucking up all the taste units.
Chandler : Okay, I'll give them back.
Chandler : What is so great about that sandwich?
UNK: Imagine the best sex you ever had.
Joey : -Are you thinking about Monica? -Yeah.
Joey : What's that like?
