Joey : That's what this is about.
Joey : Oh, my God. You hate Ross!
UNK: I don't hate Ross.
Joey : Of course you do. I saved him. You're mad at me. It adds up.
Joey : You want Ross out of the picture.
Chandler : What picture?
Joey : I don't know. But I don't like what I'm hearing.
UNK: I'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire. But it could've been a bullet.
UNK: And you didn't try to save me.
Joey : You're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
UNK: No, I knew you could take care of yourself.
UNK: You know? I mean, Ross needs help. He's not "street" like us.
Chandler : You'd risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
Chandler : That's the bottom line.
Joey : No, not exactly.
Joey : All right, look.
Joey : I wasn't trying to save Ross.
UNK: Okay?
Joey : My sandwich was next to Ross.
Monica : All right?
Joey : I was trying to save my sandwich.
Chandler : From a bullet?
Joey : -I know it doesn't make much sense. -"Much" sense?
UNK: Look, it was instinct! I just went for it.
Chandler : You risked your life for a sandwich?
Joey : I know it sounds crazy...
UNK: ...but this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
Chandler : So you didn't choose Ross before me?
Joey : No. I would never do that.
Joey : You're like my brother.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah.
Joey : In fact, to prove how much you mean to me...
UNK: Here.
UNK: -Thanks. -Easy, it's not a hot dog!
Joey : How good is that?
UNK: See?
Joey : What are you doing?
Chandler : You're showing me how much I mean to you.
Joey : With a bite.
UNK: Jeez!
Ross : What are you doing here?
UNK: Hey, you know what?
Rachel : You are in our apartment all the time!
Rachel : This is just a drop in the bucket, mister!
Ross : It doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
Ross : You're my friend and you're here.
Rachel : Okay, just a little scared. What's going on?
Ross : The most amazing thing happened tonight.
Ross : I thought my number was up.
UNK: I had an actual near-death experience.
Rachel : What happened?
UNK: We were on the ride-along with Gary and somebody took a shot at me!
