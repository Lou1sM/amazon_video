Monica : Okay, guys, listen.
UNK: Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.
UNK: So try to really keep Ross' mind off of it.
Joey : Good idea.
Chandler : Hey, man. What's up?
Ross : Just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Joey : Oh, Ross! Look, look!
Ross : What? Where?
UNK: Right over there! There! Look, look, look!
Ross : -What am I looking at? -Somebody help me out here.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Monica, sorry I didn't come by. I was out with Gary.
Phoebe : He let me ride around with him. We saw and prevented crimes.
UNK: You got to go on a ride-along?
UNK: -I want to go on a ride-along! -Me too!
UNK: -Okay. -Yeah! Me too!
Gary : Really? You?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: -Well, it's kind of dangerous. -Well, I like danger.
Gary : -Okay, you guys free tonight? -Yeah!
Chandler : You didn't say it was gonna be at nighttime.
Monica : I'm so glad you're home. We can finally organize these photos.
UNK: Oh, thank God!
UNK: Finally!
Monica : I've broken them down into categories.
Monica : We got holidays, birthdays, candids...
UNK: And I've cross-referenced them by subject.
UNK: So if you're looking up, say...
Monica : ...birthdays and dogs, you get photo 152.
UNK: See?
UNK: Oh, it's me and LePoo.
Rachel : Wow, I miss that dog.
Monica : You can also find him under "dog" and "dead."
Rachel : Great. Thanks.
Monica : Hand me that other box of photos. That's the last one.
UNK: Oops.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Good thing you numbered them.
Monica : I hadn't.
Monica : Photo 152 was a prototype.
Rachel : Honey, it's okay. It's okay.
UNK: How about I fix you a drink? Maybe a margarita?
Ross : Ross has the blender.
Ross : Everything's just falling apart.
UNK: It's okay. I'll go to Ross', get the blender.
UNK: -You get the margarita stuff ready. -All right.
UNK: His keys are in the drawer. Also, I need some cash.
Rachel : Want me to stop at the ATM?
UNK: No. While you're at Ross', if you see any lying around.
UNK: -What? -What?
Monica : I don't do that.
Ross : That was so cool, man. The way you leaned on that guy.
Chandler : It is starting to get dark out there.
Ross : He told you everything. You cracked him.
