Monica : What about Joey?
UNK: I'm going to a culinary fair in Jersey this weekend.
UNK: How weird! Chandler just said he's got a conference there.
UNK: That's funny. Seems like Chandler's conference could've been...
Monica : ...in Connecticut or Vermont.
Chandler : I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
UNK: Do you want people to think it's fake? It's a real conference.
Ross : -Is Rachel here? -No, she's out shopping.
UNK: -Damn! -What's going on?
Ross : I told Emily to come.
UNK: And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.
Phoebe : Wait a minute.
Phoebe : When Emily comes, you won't see Rachel anymore?
UNK: I'm focusing on the "I get to see my wife" part...
UNK: ...and not on the part that makes me do this.
UNK: So you'll never be in a room together?
UNK: How will that even work?
Ross : I have no idea. I mean...
Ross : But I assure you, I will figure it out.
UNK: It doesn't seem like it'll work.
Rachel : Hi, guys.
Chandler : What's going on?
Chandler : We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Joey : So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up and then we flip it.
Phoebe : That's better than my way.
Rachel : Hey guys, would you flip mine too?
UNK: Oh, man.
Rachel : Oh, look! A letter from my mom.
Ross : So, Rach?
UNK: You know how Emily's coming?
Rachel : Oh, yeah. I know.
Phoebe : Can you hear anything?
UNK: Yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Monica : Hey, Joey's ass.
Monica : What are you doing?
UNK: Remember when they fought and broke up...
UNK: ...and we were stuck here all night with no food?
UNK: When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it'd happen again.
Joey : So I hid this in here.
Monica : Candy bars, crossword puzzles...
UNK: Mad Libs! Mine!
UNK: -Okay, "Name of someone in room." -Chandler.
UNK: Come on, seriously.
UNK: What do you got in here? Magazines, Doritos
UNK: Condoms?
Joey : You don't know how long we'll be in here.
Joey : We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Chandler : And condoms are the way to do that?
UNK: Anyway, it all boils down to this.
Ross : -The last time I talked to Emily -Oh, my God! Our dog died!
