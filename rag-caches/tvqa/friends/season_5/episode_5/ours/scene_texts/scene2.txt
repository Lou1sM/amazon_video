UNK: -What? -Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!
UNK: LaPooh's still alive?
UNK: Sorry.
Rachel : It says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for...
UNK: ...nineteen blocks!
Rachel : -Oh, my God. -Sweetie, we heard you crying.
Monica : -Please don't cry. -It's LaPooh!
UNK: I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.
