UNK: Monica?
Joey : What time is it?
UNK: Nine.
Joey : But it's dark out.
Monica : That's because you always sleep till noon, silly.
UNK: This is what nine looks like.
Joey : I guess I'll get washed up then.
Joey : Watch that sunrise.
UNK: I'm getting tired of always sneaking around.
UNK: Me too. What if we went away for the weekend? No interruptions.
Chandler : We could be naked the entire time.
Monica : All weekend? That's a whole lot of naked.
UNK: I'll say I have a conference and you can have a chef thing.
UNK: I wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!
UNK: Okay. You know you're not, though.
Chandler : -Let's go. -Okay. Wait.
