UNK: Forget it.
UNK: You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about?
Rachel : Oh, yeah.
Ross : I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
Ross : Well, there's this...
Ross : ...one thing.
Ross : Here goes.
Ross : I made a promise that
UNK: -What? -Your nose is bleeding.
Rachel : -Oh, God! -You're bleeding.
UNK: Oh, not again. This happened when my grandfather died.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Gross.
Rachel : Okay. So I'm sorry. What did you want to tell me?
Rachel : Sorry. Sorry.
Ross : I can't see you anymore.
Rachel : I know, it's ridiculous. I can't see you, either. All right.
UNK: I'm just gonna go shove a bunch of tissues in my nose.
UNK: Hey, do you wanna tell me while I do that?
UNK: I'm good.
UNK: -I think you'll like this room more. -Okay, great.
UNK: Hotel Clerk : They say he's only got half a tank left.
UNK: Half a tank? Still lots of high-speed chasing to do!
UNK: -I'll bet he's heading for Canada. -They always do.
Monica : -We're switching rooms again. -What? Why?
UNK: This has a garden view. We paid for an ocean view.
UNK: Our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.
UNK: -The carpet smelled. -Like ocean?
UNK: No, like feet.
UNK: Excuse me. Can I talk to you over here for just a second?
UNK: These clowns want to take us for a ride. I won't let them.
Monica : We're not a couple of suckers.
UNK: I hear you, Mugsy.
Chandler : All these rooms are fine.
UNK: Just pick one so I can watch the
Chandler : Have a perfect, magical weekend together with you?
UNK: Oh, man, he almost hit a gas truck.
UNK: Do you ever watch Baywatch?
Monica : -This one I like. -Nothing. Nothing. It's over. Damn it!
Chandler : This is regularly scheduled programming!
UNK: -I wanted to see them talk to his neighbors. -Well, I'm standing right here...
UNK: -...you could talk to me. -You didn't know him.
Monica : Can we turn the TV off?
Monica : Do we really want to spend the weekend like this?
Chandler : Am I getting in the way of the room-switching fun?
UNK: Don't blame me for tonight.
Chandler : Who should I blame? The nice bellman?
UNK: Or the idiot who thought he could drive...
Monica : ...from Albany to Canada on half a tank of gas?
Chandler : Do not speak ill of the dead.
Monica : We're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.
UNK: What's the matter?
Chandler : I just want to watch a little television.
UNK: Jeez, relax, Mom.
Monica : What did you say?
UNK: I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."
UNK: You know what, Chandler? You like fast getaways? Watch this.
UNK: I don't like fast getaways, I like car chases.
UNK: -Hey, what's up? -Hey.
Ross : I've been wanting to tell you something and I just have to get it out.
Rachel : Okay. What's up?
UNK: Okay, before I tell you I just have to know...
UNK: ...is your nose okay?
UNK: Are all the other family pets in good health?
UNK: Well, Davey's still pining after LaPooh...
UNK: ...but, you know, he's a tough little turtle.
UNK: You know how you said to do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
