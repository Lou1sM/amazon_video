Joey : Who's Kip?
Chandler : My old roommate. We all hung out together.
Joey : Oh, that poor bastard.
Rachel : You told me the story. He and Monica dated.
UNK: When they broke up, you all promised you'd stay his friend.
Rachel : And what happened? He got phased out.
UNK: -You won't be phased out. -Of course I am.
UNK: It won't happen to Ross. He's your brother, your college roommate.
UNK: Kip didn't even have to be Kip. We handled that all wrong.
UNK: It was a long time ago.
UNK: And it was before you and me were around. They didn't know what they were doing.
UNK: Chandler had a mustache, for crying out loud.
Rachel : It was just a matter of time.
UNK: I just assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Rachel : You live far away, you're not related.
Rachel : You lift right out.
Joey : Hey, Mr. Bing.
Joey : That hotel you stayed at called.
Joey : Someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Chandler : Yes, that was mine.
UNK: I figured you met a girl and she left it.
Chandler : That would have made more sense.
Joey : I don't even feel like I know you anymore.
UNK: All right, I'm just going to ask you this one time.
Joey : Whatever you say, I'll believe you.
Joey : Were you or were you not...
Joey : ...on a gay cruise?
Rachel : I'm sorry about the whole "lifting out" thing.
Rachel : You gotta come with me.
UNK: -Where? -Wherever I go.
UNK: You and me, we'll start a new group. We're the best ones.
UNK: Okay, but try to get Joey too.
UNK: Phoebe, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone?
UNK: Sure.
Phoebe : Bye, Ross.
UNK: Forever.
UNK: Why are you here? Isn't this against the rules?
Ross : I talked to Monica.
Ross : Look, I'm the one who made the choice.
Ross : I'm the one who's making things change.
Ross : So I should be the one to, you know, step back.
Ross : No, no, it's okay. Really.
UNK: Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving...
Ross : ...their college roommates at reunions...
UNK: ...and Joey at Burger King.
Ross : Is that better?
Rachel : No, it's not better.
Rachel : I still don't get to see you.
Ross : What would you do? If you were me, what would you do?
UNK: First, I'd have said the right name at my wedding.
Ross : I can't believe this.
Chandler : I know.
Ross : I am so sorry.
Rachel : I know that too.
Ross : Hey, Rach?
UNK: Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said you want to talk to me about a trip?
