Rachel : Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Ross : And while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants...
Ross : ...is for me not to see you anymore.
Rachel : That's crazy! You can't do that. What are you going to tell her?
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: You've already agreed to this.
Ross : It's awful, I know.
Ross : But I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
Ross : And I do. I have to make this marriage work. I have to.
Ross : But the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.
Rachel : Lucky me! Oh, my God! That is good news, Ross!
Rachel : That's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died!
Ross : You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Rachel : Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?
UNK: -Let me make this easier for you. -What are you doing?
Rachel : -Storming out. -It's your apartment.
Rachel : Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!
UNK: Damn Rolos!
Joey : You're back! How was your conference?
Chandler : It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues the entire time.
Chandler : Are you kidding with this?
UNK: So your weekend was a bust?
Chandler : No, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
UNK: You know, at the Taj Mahal he has his own private glass elevator.
UNK: That's right. Made by Otis Elevators.
UNK: And they don't usually do glass.
UNK: What kinds of stuff do you know?
Joey : You're back too.
UNK: Could I talk to you for a second?
Joey : -How was your chef thing? -It was awful.
UNK: Some people don't appreciate good food.
UNK: Maybe the food tasted good at first...
Chandler : ...but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
UNK: How much was the room? I'll pay my half.
Chandler : Fine. $300.
UNK: $300?
Chandler : Just think of it as $25 per room.
Joey : What are you guys woofing about?
UNK: Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!
UNK: I was only stealing it back, the one that she stole from me.
UNK: Stealing and now lying.
Phoebe : You know what? Now that I think about it...
Joey : ...I constantly find myself without 20s, and you...
Joey : ...always have lots.
Ross : You should've seen the look on her face.
Ross : I don't want Rachel to hate me. I don't know what to do.
Joey : -You want my advice? -Yes. Please.
UNK: -You won't like it. -That's okay.
UNK: You got married too fast.
Ross : -That's not advice. -I told you.
Ross : I'm going to the bathroom.
Joey : If anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
UNK: Me neither.
Monica : Maybe I could do it.
Rachel : I know you guys heard about me and Ross.
UNK: But I've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.
Joey : I don't know if this falls under that category...
Joey : ...but Ross is right back there.
Rachel : -That's not Ross. -Not that guy.
Phoebe : He does look like him, though.
Chandler : Ross is in the bathroom.
Rachel : Oh, my God! It's happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
UNK: Yeah, you're not Kip.
Rachel : Do you even know who Kip is?
Joey : Who cares? You're Rachel.
