Chandler : I can't believe it! We're here!
Monica : Chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Chandler : You should live with Joey. Rolos everywhere.
UNK: This is so great. No one's gonna bother us.
UNK: And we're gonna do it.
UNK: I'm gonna do it with Monica!
UNK: Chandler, stop yelling that you and I are gonna do it!
UNK: -I'll be right back. -Okay.
Chandler : Oh, yes!
Chandler : Get in here. There's a high-speed car chase on!
Monica : We're switching rooms.
Chandler : Oh, dear God! They gave us glasses!
UNK: The glasses have lipstick on them.
Monica : Who knows what else they didn't change?
UNK: You wanna switch rooms because they didn't switch the glasses?
UNK: I didn't wanna say anything, but the carpet smells too.
UNK: I want this weekend to be perfect. We can change rooms, can't we?
Chandler : Okay, but let's do it now. Chopper Five just lost its feed!
