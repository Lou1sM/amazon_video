UNK: Frank Sr. : What about the girls?
Phoebe : Well, Ursula is a waitress and she lives in Soho.
Phoebe : And Phoebe...
Phoebe : ...is on this couch.
Phoebe : Yep, lipstick and a daughter. Big day for you!
UNK: [scene : Phoebe, I...
UNK: It's just, I don't know what to say.
UNK: Frank Sr. : I just can't believe that you're my daughter. You're so pretty.
Phoebe : Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.
UNK: Frank Sr. : Would it make you feel better if I said...
UNK: ...that I was very, very sorry I left?
UNK: It doesn't matter what you say. It won't make a difference.
Phoebe : So you can just go.
UNK: Well, you know, in my defense, I was a lousy father.
UNK: -That's your defense? -Yes, it is.
UNK: Frank Sr. : I burned the formula, and I put your diapers on backwards.
UNK: I made up a song to sing to you, but that made you cry even more.
Phoebe : You make up songs?
UNK: Well, no, just that one. But it was stupid.
UNK: Let's see, how did it go?
UNK: Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
UNK: Why won't you go to sleep?
UNK: Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
UNK: You're keeping me up
UNK: Frank Sr. : I'm not very good at this.
Phoebe : Well, I am.
Phoebe : Not yet. No.
UNK: How'd the audition go?
Joey : Estelle said I didn't get it.
Rachel : What? Why? Joey, you were so ready for it.
Joey : I thought so too...
UNK: ...but the casting people had problems with me.
Ross : What kind of problem?
Joey : To tell you the truth...
Joey : ...they had a problem with the bag!
UNK: You know what? It was a stupid play anyway.
Monica : It's time to give up the bag.
UNK: I don't want to give up the bag.
UNK: I don't have to give it up. Do I, Rach?
Joey : You think I should give up the bag!
UNK: Joey, I'm sorry. As terrific as I think you are with it...
Rachel : ...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
UNK: Frank Sr. : I can't believe this!
UNK: Wait, I'm not saying you shouldn't have a bag.
Rachel : There are other bags that are maybe a little less...
UNK: ...controversial.
UNK: Yeah, they're called wallets.
UNK: You're right. You're right.
UNK: This bag has become like a part of me.
UNK: It's like...my bag.
UNK: It had a place for everything.
UNK: -Oh, man. -What?
UNK: There's a whole series of pockets here I didn't even know about, Rach. Look.
UNK: Ursula, I have the most amazing news.
UNK: I found our dad.
UNK: Phoebe.
UNK: Your sister. And I found our dad.
UNK: John Glenn? John Glenn is not our dad.
UNK: No, I will not join you in the lawsuit against him.
UNK: It doesn't matter that he wasn't there while we were growing up.
UNK: He's not our father.
UNK: What do you mean that's for a jury to decide?
