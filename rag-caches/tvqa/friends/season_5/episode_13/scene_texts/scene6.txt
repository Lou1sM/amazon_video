UNK: ...for the best bad-massage... Who would get that?
Chandler : It would be you!
Chandler : You, Monica! And you'd get all the votes.
UNK: So they could call the award, "The Monica"?
UNK: Absolutely.
Monica : I suck!
UNK: Thank you for meeting me.
Phoebe : Thank you.
Phoebe : Come sit.
UNK: Sit.
UNK: Sit!
UNK: Alrighty. Before we get started, I need you...
UNK: ...to state for the record that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
UNK: Frank Sr. : Yes, I am.
UNK: What did Frances leave me?
UNK: Frank Sr. : That's why you wanted me to come.
UNK: Yes, she did. She left you...
Phoebe : ...this lipstick.
UNK: It's used.
UNK: Cool!
Phoebe : I have just a few questions to ask, so I'll get out my official forms.
UNK: So question one :
UNK: You were married to Frances' daughter, Lilly. Correct?
UNK: Frank Sr. : Yes, I was.
UNK: Question two. Did that marriage end :
A : Happily?
B : Medium?
UNK: Or C : In the total abandonment...
Phoebe : ...of her and her two children?
UNK: Frank Sr. : It really says that?
Phoebe : Yeah, see?
UNK: I guess then I would have to say C.
Phoebe : Total abandonment.
UNK: Reasons for abandonment :
A : Top-secret government work.
B : Amnesia.
UNK: Or C : You're just a selfish, irresponsible...
Phoebe : ...bad, bad man.
UNK: I don't want the lipstick that much.
UNK: Frank Sr. : Would you do me a favor?
UNK: Frank Sr. : Would you give Lilly...
UNK: Frank Sr. : ...that, please?
UNK: Frank Sr. : When you see Lilly, give her that note.
UNK: Frank Sr. : I wanted to talk to her at the memorial...
UNK: ...but I pictured her getting mad the way you did, and I chickened out.
UNK: I wrote her a note. Give it to her, please?
UNK: But you came to see Lilly?
UNK: Frank Sr. : Yeah. Why?
Phoebe : Lilly's dead.
UNK: Frank Sr. : She what?
Phoebe : She's dead.
UNK: Frank Sr. : Are you sure?
UNK: If she isn't, cremating her was a big mistake.
UNK: Frank Sr. : I can't believe this. I just can't believe
UNK: How? Oh, my God.
UNK: Frank Sr. : How long ago?
Phoebe : 17 years ago.
