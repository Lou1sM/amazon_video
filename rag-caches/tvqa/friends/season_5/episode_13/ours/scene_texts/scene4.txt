Joey : I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
UNK: Great! That bag will get you that part.
Chandler : And a date with a man.
UNK: You know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag.
Joey : And it's as handy as it is becoming.
Joey : Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.
UNK: You guys have to get used to the fact that Joey...
Joey : ...comes with a bag!
UNK: I've got to meet my dad.
UNK: Will you tell him who you are?
Phoebe : Not at first. I don't want to freak him out.
Ross : But aren't you pissed at him?
Ross : This guy abandoned you.
UNK: If it were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger.
Ross : I'd walk in there, I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!
Ross : You and me, outside. Right now!"
UNK: I kind of scared myself.
Monica : Well, at least you scared someone.
Phoebe : You'd think I'd be angry.
UNK: You'd think I'd want to rip his tiny, little head off!
Phoebe : Fortunately, I'm past it.
Monica : You do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Phoebe : Get off!
Phoebe : Stop it! Why are you doing that to me?
Monica : What are you talking about?
Phoebe : As a masseuse and a human...
Phoebe : ...I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
Monica : I give good massages.
UNK: I gave them to Rachel before she got allergic.
UNK: And Chandler, he loves them! Watch.
Phoebe : He does not like it. He's in pain!
Monica : -No, he's not. -Yes, he is!
UNK: -What? -I'm sorry, but
Monica : You've been lying to me?
UNK: I can't believe that.
UNK: Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.
Monica : But the minute we start to lie to each other...
UNK: And by "we"...
Monica : ...I mean society.
UNK: Anytime you're ready.
Joey : Well, you must be new here.
UNK: Maybe we get a table, I buy you a drink.
UNK: The Casting Director : Could you try it without the purse?
Joey : Yeah, sure.
Joey : Well, you must be new here. Maybe we sit
Joey : Can I ask you something?
UNK: The Casting Director : Sure. What?
Joey : Well, first, it's not a purse.
UNK: Anytime.
UNK: If you think it's a woman's bag, it's not.
Joey : It's a man's bag.
UNK: Okay. And go!
Joey : Let me show you the catalog.
UNK: Look. See?
Joey : It's the latest thing.
Joey : Everyone's got one. Men, women, children.
UNK: The Casting Director : Do you sell these?
Joey : No, these babies sell themselves.
Phoebe : Thank you. That was great.
UNK: But I didn't read anything.
UNK: The Casting Director : I think we've seen enough.
UNK: All right, I'll see you.
Joey : We got it. We got it.
Chandler : Is Rachel here?
Chandler : Listen, I just wanted to apologize about the whole massage thing.
UNK: I really like them.
Monica : Please, stop!
Monica : We're supposed to be honest.
UNK: I wish you could tell me, "I don't like your massages."
