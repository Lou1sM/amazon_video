Monica : I can't believe we've never done this. It's so good!
UNK: It's so good for Monica.
Chandler : Time's up! My turn.
UNK: -That was half an hour? -It's your timer.
Monica : I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages.
Chandler : All right, then massage me up right nice!
Monica : It's so good, isn't it?
Chandler : I don't know what I did to deserve it.
UNK: Now stop trying to add more time to your massage.
Monica : Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Chandler : Goodbye, muscles!
