Chandler : She gives the worst massages ever!
Chandler : It was like she was torturing me for information.
Chandler : I wanted to give it up. I just didn't know what it was!
UNK: If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.
Chandler : For the first time, I'm in a real relationship.
UNK: I won't screw that up by telling the truth.
Joey : Dude, look out!
Joey : You almost crushed my hat.
UNK: Sorry.
Chandler : And the bunny got away.
Ross : This would be the place where you explain the hat.
UNK: This is called a top hat.
UNK: And why are you wearing this? Is it "top hat"?
Joey : There's this play...
Joey : ...and I'm up for the part of this cool, suave, international guy.
UNK: A clotheshorse. So I figure...
UNK: ...everyone at the audition will wear ultra-hip, high-fashion stuff.
UNK: And you'll make them disappear?
Joey : Like you could find something this sophisticated.
UNK: Done!
UNK: If you want to look good, come to the store. I'll help you.
UNK: -Thanks! -Sure.
Rachel : Please, take those off!
UNK: Hey, Phoebe. How's it going?
Phoebe : Only okay because I just got back from the hospital.
Joey : Are you all right?
Phoebe : I'm fine, but my grandma sort of died.
UNK: Phoebe, sorry.
Phoebe : It's okay.
Phoebe : She had a really incredible life.
UNK: It's not like I won't see her again. She'll visit.
Rachel : Maybe she's with us right now.
UNK: Right. She's on a new spiritual plain and she'll come to the coffeehouse.
Monica : I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside!
UNK: Phoebe' grandmother just died.
UNK: Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
UNK: Actually, it's kind of cool. Because it's like...
UNK: ...you know, one life ends and another begins.
Monica : Not the way they're doing it.
Monica : What happened? How did she die?
Phoebe : We were in the market...
Phoebe : ...and she bent down to get some yogurt and never came back up again.
Monica : I'm so sorry.
UNK: The last thing she said was :
UNK: "You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt, and we'll meet at the checkout counter."
UNK: You know what?
Phoebe : We will meet at the checkout counter.
Rachel : Since you're returning all this stuff...
UNK: ...you'll have to wear underwear.
Chandler : All right. You'd better show me that too.
Rachel : It's missing something.
Joey : Really? A purse?
Rachel : It's not a purse. It's a shoulder bag.
UNK: It looks like a woman's purse.
UNK: Trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.
Rachel : See, look. Men carrying the bag.
Rachel : See, look. Women carrying the bag.
UNK: But it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.
Rachel : Exactly. Unisex!
Joey : Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
UNK: No, Joey. U-N-I sex.
Joey : I ain't gonna say no to that!
Ursula : -Who is it? -It's Phoebe.
Ursula : Oh, great!
Ursula : Oh, you.
