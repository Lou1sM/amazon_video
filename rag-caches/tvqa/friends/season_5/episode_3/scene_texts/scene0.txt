UNK: I'm Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out.
Nurse : Have you started having contractions?
UNK: Not yet. I heard they really hurt. Do they?
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Nurse : Which of you is the father?
Phoebe : None of them are. The father is my brother.
UNK: I'll miss watching you freak people out like that.
UNK: This is for the babies to look at someday.
UNK: Do you want to say anything before it starts?
Phoebe : Hi, kids! It's me, Aunt Phoebe.
Phoebe : Can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
UNK: What took you so long?
Ross : Your cab left when ours did.
