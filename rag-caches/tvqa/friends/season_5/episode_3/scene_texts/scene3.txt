Phoebe : They are? Why?
UNK: They'll be born on the Fonz's half-birthday.
Phoebe : Happy Birthday.
UNK: Dr. Harad : Just to clarify...
UNK: Dr. Harad : ...I'm not Fonzie.
UNK: It's a terrific thing that you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
UNK: No, it is.
UNK: Can I tell you a secret?
Phoebe : I want to keep one.
UNK: Oh, I'm gonna be on the news.
UNK: You must be kidding.
UNK: You know you can't keep one of these babies.
Phoebe : Maybe I can. You don't know.
UNK: I do. Frank and Alice will want to keep all their children.
UNK: Maybe not. You know?
Phoebe : Three babies are a handful.
UNK: Maybe they'll want to unload one.
Phoebe : I hate to miss an opportunity because I didn't ask.
UNK: Dr. Harad : Phoebe, no. This is insane.
Phoebe : Just ask him.
UNK: What? Me?
Phoebe : I can't ask him!
UNK: Do you know how inappropriate that would be?
Phoebe : All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.
UNK: Just feel him out.
UNK: No. I will not ask Frank to give you one of his kids.
Phoebe : You're right.
Phoebe : Tell him it's for you.
UNK: Feeling better, sweetie?
Joey : Maybe a little.
Joey : Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Phoebe : Me too.
Ross : I just heard. What's up?
UNK: Joey's Doctor : Kidney stones!
UNK: Ordinarily, we try to break the stones up with shock waves.
UNK: But they're too close to the bladder.
UNK: Either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
UNK: No, no, no, no. Nothing is going up, okay?
Joey : Up is not an option. What's a urethra?
Joey : Are you crazy?
Phoebe : Did you ask him?
UNK: No, I haven't had a chance yet.
UNK: I'm kind of on a clock here.
UNK: Dr. Harad : Oh, Fonzie.
UNK: You know who I always liked? Mork.
Phoebe : Undo it. Undo it.
UNK: Dr. Harad : Fonzie met Mork.
UNK: Dr. Harad : Mork froze Fonzie.
Rachel : But Fonzie was already cool.
Rachel : So he wasn't hurt. Right?
UNK: Dr. Harad : Yeah, that's right.
UNK: How you doing?
Phoebe : Okay. Doctor says any minute now.
UNK: You know, Alice is going to be here so soon.
UNK: You couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?
UNK: Sorry, I'm in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
UNK: This is Dan, one of the guys we're dating on Saturday.
Dan : Nice to meet you.
Monica : I'm really looking forward to Saturday night. Really!
Chandler : So, Dan...
Chandler : ...nurse, not a doctor, huh?
UNK: Kind of girlie, isn't it?
UNK: That's okay. I'm doing this to get through medical school.
UNK: And it didn't feel "girlie" during the Gulf War.
UNK: Sure.
Chandler : Thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
UNK: Why wait till Saturday? Are you free tomorrow?
UNK: Sure. I'll get somebody to cover me.
UNK: Great!
UNK: Hey, you and me, Saturday night?
UNK: -No. -All right, very good!
Phoebe : This is a big one.
