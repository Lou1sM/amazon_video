Joey : These are the headlines when you were born.
Joey : Now, girl baby, turn away. And boy babies...
Joey : ...check it out!
Joey : This is what naked women looked like when you were born.
UNK: Now let's dive into the good stuff.
Phoebe : Okay, I'm having another one!
Phoebe : This one doesn't hurt eith Yes, it does!
UNK: I was kind of hoping that was it.
Ross : Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?
Joey : A couple of nurses asked them out.
Chandler : Really? Male nurses?
Joey : Yeah, I was bummed too.
Chandler : So they're going on dates.
UNK: -When? -I think Saturday.
Frank : -What's with him? -Sympathy pains.
UNK: It was sweet at first, but now I think he's trying to steal my thunder.
UNK: Dr. Harad : Let's see what we got here.
UNK: Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.
Chandler : This Fonzie person you keep referring to...
Chandler : ...is that another doctor?
Phoebe : Oh, no, no.
UNK: Dr. Harad : Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli.
UNK: Dr. Harad : The Fonz.
Ross : All right.
Frank : It's not that weird, is it?
Phoebe : It's very weird!
Phoebe : I don't want some guy down there telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."
UNK: He doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie
Phoebe : What are you doing?
Phoebe : Why are you defending him? Just get me another doctor...
UNK: ...who isn't crazy and doesn't Fonzie!
Ross : Again, it's not
Chandler : Hey, there you are!
UNK: There's something you should know.
UNK: Is this about you dating the nurse? Joey told me.
UNK: I am so fine. You and I, we're just nothing.
Monica : Just goofing around.
Monica : I was about to tell you I was getting out of it.
UNK: But if we're just "goofing around," maybe I will go out with him.
Chandler : Fine. Maybe I will too.
UNK: Hey! Look what I found in the gift shop.
Joey : Get up! Get up! Get up!
UNK: This is Dr. Oberman.
Ross : He has no strong feelings about Fonzie...
Ross : ...or any of the Happy Days gang.
Phoebe : You're going into what grade?
UNK: I'm actually a first-year resident. I graduated early.
Phoebe : Me too.
UNK: I should have specified I'd need a grown-up doctor.
UNK: Really, I'm fully qualified
UNK: Doogie!
Phoebe : Doesn't anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon?
Phoebe : Go, little boy! Go!
Frank : Oh, cool. You made him cry!
UNK: Joey's Doctor : Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Joey : Well, what else could it be?
UNK: Joey's Doctor : It's kidney stones.
UNK: Or...
UNK: Joey's Doctor : Kidney stones.
UNK: -If it was something else? -Well, that would be "kidney stones."
UNK: Dr. Harad : You're getting there.
UNK: Dr. Harad : These babies are very, very lucky.
