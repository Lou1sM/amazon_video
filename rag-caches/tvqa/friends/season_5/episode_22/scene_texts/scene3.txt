Rachel : Oh, my God. What does that thing do?
Monica : -An eye removal machine. -I'm out of here.
Monica : I'm kidding.
UNK: Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.
UNK: Monica said you were nervous. Everything will be fine.
Rachel : -So we're done. -Almost, but first we gotta start.
UNK: This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.
UNK: Put your chin here.
UNK: Dr. Miller : Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
UNK: What?
UNK: Dr. Miller : A small puff of air. Now, come on!
Ross : Here we go.
UNK: One, two, three.
Rachel : I'm sorry. All right.
UNK: I'm gonna stay in here this time.
UNK: Ready?
UNK: -One, two -I'm sorry.
Joey : You know what? I'm gonna hold her head.
UNK: Dr. Miller : That's okay.
Rachel : I'm sorry.
UNK: Dr. Miller : You're young. You don't have glaucoma.
UNK: So it was very, very nice to meet you, sir.
Rachel : What are you? Are you crazy?
UNK: You got a small, minor infection in that left eye.
UNK: Take these drops for a week and you'll be as good as new.
UNK: No, I don't put things in my eye.
UNK: We'll see you here in three months. And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Rachel : Give me the damn drops!
Monica : Dr. Miller?
