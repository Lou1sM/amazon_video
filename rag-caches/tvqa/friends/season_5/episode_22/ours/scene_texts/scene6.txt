Chandler : Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!
Chandler : Yeah. I'm gonna die here.
Ross : Are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Ross : Because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Phoebe : No. That made me feel precious.
Monica : Because he's always correcting people's grammar?
UNK: "Whom, whom." Sometimes it's "who"!
UNK: Yeah? Sometimes it's :
Rachel : Did you beat him at a board game? He's such a baby when he loses.
Ross : Okay, I'm the baby.
UNK: Hey! Stop it!
Monica : What are you doing here?
Chandler : Joey kicked me out of the car on the bridge.
UNK: -Why? -I don't know. He went crazy.
UNK: We played that game where you ask questions and answer fast.
Phoebe : That game should not be played without my supervision.
UNK: I don't know what made him mad.
Chandler : All I said was that this wouldn't be his big break...
UNK: ...that it wouldn't do anything for him...
UNK: ...and that it didn't sound real.
Chandler : Okay, he should've pushed me off the bridge.
Phoebe : What's in the bag?
UNK: I figured you'd be mad at me...
UNK: ...so I got gifts that I found on the roadside.
UNK: -Who wants the one-legged teddy bear? -I do!
Monica : -Not even close. -I need help! I can't do this.
UNK: Come on. Let's do it.
UNK: Dr. Miller : Sit down. All right, put your head back.
Monica : -Now open your eyes. -Okay, they are.
Monica : -How many fingers am I holding up? -Four.
Monica : I was thinking four.
UNK: -Really? -Yes!
Monica : Why don't we start with a practice one.
Monica : -No drops. -Great!
UNK: On three. One, two, three.
Monica : My pillow's all wet!
Rachel : Well, you said it was practice!
Monica : Why did you move?
Rachel : I knew you were lying!
Monica : -Come here. -What are you doing?
Rachel : Stop it! Oh, my God!
Monica : I am going...
Monica : Turn it over!
Monica : I am going to get...
Monica : ...get these drops in your eye.
Rachel : Oh, my God! You really are freakishly strong.
UNK: Stop! Stop!
Rachel : Stop it!
Monica : Damn, it's empty!
UNK: If Joey and Chandler walked in now, we could make a fortune.
Phoebe : That is definitely Chandler, Joey or Ross.
Phoebe : Or Rachel.
Monica : It's Joey.
Monica : Chandler told me what happened. He's really upset.
UNK: Not as upset as he'll be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests.
UNK: What did you do to them?
Joey : There's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.
UNK: I gotta ask Phoebe something about the car.
UNK: Hold on one second.
Phoebe : -Hey, dude. -Hey, Phoebe.
Joey : This wooden box keeps sliding out. What is it?
Phoebe : My grandma.
Phoebe : And thanks. She's having a great time.
Chandler : Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
Phoebe : Chandler's here. He was wondering if
Phoebe : I guess he ran out of change.
