Ross : What's going on?
Rachel : My eye is a little itchy.
Joey : Mine too. Yeah.
Monica : It's really red. You should go see my eye doctor.
UNK: I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.
UNK: That's all I hear. Richard, Richard, Richard.
UNK: Since we've dated, I've said his name twice.
Chandler : Okay. So Richard, Richard.
Monica : It's not Richard. It's this new guy. He's good.
Rachel : I'm sorry. I'm not going to an eye doctor.
Ross : -Oh, God. Here we go. -What?
Ross : Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's...
Ross : ...she, like, freaks out. Watch.
Rachel : Ross, come on!
UNK: I have a weird thing with my eye. Can we not talk about it?
UNK: Hey, Rach. You know that great song? "Me, Myself and Eye."
Rachel : Monica! Come on!
Ross : All those in favor of getting lunch, say, "eye."
Rachel : Ross! Stop it!
Chandler : How much did I love The King and Eye?
UNK: Chandler!
Joey : Me too, me too!
UNK: Just stop it! That's enough!
Chandler : -You okay there, man? -Yeah. I got too excited.
UNK: The One with Joey's Big Break
