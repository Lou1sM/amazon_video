Chandler : We've been driving for a half-hour. You haven't looked at the road once.
Joey : Don't worry. It's out there.
UNK: Maybe I just need lunch. You wanna eat?
Joey : My treat.
UNK: Isn't that Ross' money?
UNK: Ross' treat. Where do you wanna eat?
Ross : I don't know.
Joey : I know how we can decide.
UNK: I'll ask you questions.
Joey : And then you have to answer real fast.
Joey : So clear your mind. Clear it right out. Clear it out.
UNK: It's all clear except for this image of a small, purple lamp.
UNK: Is that all right if that stays in there?
UNK: I don't see why not. I guess.
UNK: You have to answer with the first thing that pops into your head, okay?
Joey : -Would you rather be too wet or too dry? -Too dry.
Joey : -Do you believe in ghosts? -No.
UNK: -Will this movie be my big break? -No.
UNK: -What? -Yes.
UNK: -Dude, you said, no. -I also said, yes.
UNK: -This won't be my big break? -No.
Joey : I don't believe this.
UNK: Look, I just don't want you to get your hopes up too high.
Joey : What are you talking about? I'm the lead in a movie!
UNK: They're not even paying you! This doesn't sound like a real movie!
Joey : I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
UNK: I don't think this is gonna be your big break.
UNK: Are you on this trip to make me feel like a loser?
Joey : -I'd rather be alone. -You don't want me here?
UNK: Not if you're like this.
Chandler : The next time you ask me a question like that, I'll lie.
Joey : I don't want you on the trip.
Chandler : Why don't you pull over. I'll get out now.
UNK: Fine.
Chandler : Get out.
UNK: You can't stop on a bridge.
Chandler : -Get out! -Fine!
