Phoebe : -A piece of paper and it says, "Ross." -I see.
Joey : I just got off the phone with Estelle. Guess what?
Joey : I got the lead!
Chandler : You got the lead in a movie? What's it about?
UNK: It's called Shutterspeed. It's really cool.
Joey : I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in, like, a day.
Joey : And then she disappears. But I find out where she lives.
UNK: This old lady answers the door. I say, "Where's Betsy?"
Joey : And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
UNK: Chilling!
Joey : The best part is, we're filming in the desert outside of Vegas.
Joey : -You know what that means. -I know.
UNK: Road trip! We can rent a car. I have to be there by Tuesday.
Phoebe : Wait! My grandmother's dead.
UNK: We can talk about that too, Phoebe.
Phoebe : No, her cab.
Phoebe : She probably won't be using it. Drive it to Las Vegas.
Joey : All right! Thanks!
UNK: What are we gonna do about my job?
Rachel : Not go.
Chandler : Great! Road trip, baby!
UNK: Is this okay?
Monica : Chandler, you don't have to ask for my permission.
Monica : You can go.
UNK: Rach, we'll be late for the eye doctor.
Rachel : All right. Let's get this over with.
Rachel : Look what I did.
Rachel : I mean, look at this mess.
UNK: We're gonna probably have to clean this up.
UNK: I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!
UNK: If you thought that this mess was gonna bother me, you are wrong!
Monica : All right, let's go, Blinky.
Phoebe : Hey, Joey. What's up?
Joey : I can't decide which route to take to Vegas.
Joey : You've traveled a lot, right?
Phoebe : Yeah, I've been around.
Joey : Which route should I take? The north or the south route?
UNK: If you take the north route, there's a man with a beard of bees.
Joey : Great! Problem solved!
UNK: On the south route, there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Joey : Well, back to square one.
Phoebe : I know a way that you can decide.
UNK: I'll ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
UNK: Yes!
Phoebe : Good. But wait.
UNK: Here we go. I want you to relax.
Phoebe : Take a deep breath.
Phoebe : Clear your mind.
Phoebe : -Peanut butter or egg whites? -Peanut butter.
Phoebe : -Be a fireman or a swimmer? -Swimmer.
UNK: -You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel? -Monica.
Joey : I always thought it'd be Rachel.
Phoebe : -No thinking. Tie or ascot? -Ascot.
UNK: -North or south route? -North.
UNK: Bam! There you go! Huh?
Joey : That was incredible! Beard of bees here I come!
Phoebe : This guy again.
UNK: Hey, what's up?
UNK: Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?
UNK: What do you wanna see?
Ross : I don't know.
UNK: I know how to decide. Show him your game.
Phoebe : No, thank you.
Ross : What's with her?
Ross : I don't know. I know how we can decide.
Joey : I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick.
Joey : -Action or comedy? -Action.
Phoebe : Who would you rather sleep with, Monica or Rachel?
Ross : Dude, you are sick.
Joey : I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
