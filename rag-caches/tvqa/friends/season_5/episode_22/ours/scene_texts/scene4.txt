UNK: P-E-C-F-D.
UNK: Dr. Miller : Very good, Monica!
UNK: Dr. Miller : -You know where they are. -I sure do.
Monica : And you don't get one.
UNK: You know, those eye drops are a miracle.
UNK: My eye is 100 percent better.
Monica : -They're still in my coat. -Damn!
Joey : You ready to go?
UNK: How cold will it be there? Will all these sweater vests be enough?
UNK: -What? -I love you.
Joey : I wish Ross was coming with us. I'll miss him.
UNK: Thanks. I just got that jerk out of my mind.
Chandler : Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Joey : Not really. It's an independent film.
UNK: We don't have a big budget. I'll stay in your room.
UNK: Once you get paid, you'll be springing for a suite.
Chandler : They must be paying you a lot.
UNK: For every dollar Shutterspeed makes...
Joey : ...one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Chandler : You don't get paid unless it makes money?
Joey : Did you not hear the plot of the movie?
UNK: "She's been dead for 10 years."
Joey : I'm gonna be a millionaire!
UNK: I wanted to say goodbye.
UNK: And to see if you guys would place a little bet for me.
Ross : Twenty bucks on black 15.
Joey : -You got it! -All right.
UNK: -You remember the number, right? -Yeah, black 13.
Ross : -Black 15! -You got it.
Chandler : -All right. Bye-bye, now. -Bye, you guys.
UNK: I'll say bye at the car.
UNK: Anyone wanna say bye to me at the car?
Rachel : I'll say goodbye to you at the car if you don't mind the pus.
Rachel : See you!
UNK: But wait a minute. The pus is good. It means it's healing.
UNK: Hey, Phoebe. What you reading?
UNK: Hello?
Rachel : Come on!
Phoebe : Sorry, I didn't see you there.
UNK: Phoebe, are you mad at me or something?
UNK: If you are, please tell me what it is I did.
Phoebe : -If you don't know, I can't help you. -I don't know.
Phoebe : Well, I can't help you.
Ross : Well, whatever it is, I am very, very sorry. Okay?
Phoebe : Apology accepted.
UNK: So we're good?
Ross : I'll see you later, okay?
UNK: Bye, fat-ass.
Rachel : All right!
Ross : Will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me?
Phoebe : I don't know! I don't remember!
UNK: What do you mean, you can't remember?
UNK: I was so focused on being mad at you, I forgot what it was I was mad about.
Ross : If you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Phoebe : Oh, no. I am mad at you. I know that much.
UNK: But I'm sorry about the fat-ass thing because you have a sweet, little heinie.
Joey : I'm getting pretty tired. You'll have to take over soon.
