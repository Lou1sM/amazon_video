UNK: How am I gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
UNK: Send him something. So when he gets there, he'll know you're sorry.
Chandler : That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn?
UNK: No, don't say, "I'm sorry," with porn.
Monica : You should send him a carton of cigarettes.
UNK: Because that way he can trade it for protection.
Phoebe : No. That's prison.
UNK: I know how we're gonna figure this out.
Phoebe : Clear your mind...
Ross : ...and answer the first thing that comes into your head.
UNK: -Do you like flora or fauna? -Fauna.
UNK: -Simon or Garfunkel? -Garfunkel.
Ross : -Why are you mad? -You said I was boring.
UNK: When did I say that?
Phoebe : Oh, my God! I remember now! We were playing chess.
Ross : Phoebe, you and I have never played chess.
Phoebe : Remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing. You said I was boring.
Phoebe : Then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz.
Phoebe : There's a chance this may have been a dream.
UNK: So this entire time, you've been angry with me because of a dream?
UNK: Well, guess what, now I'm mad at you.
UNK: I wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream.
UNK: Otherwise we're wasting our time.
UNK: Stanley!
UNK: Your leading man is here. Let's get to work.
Stanley : Slight change of plans.
Stanley : We've shut down.
Monica : What? Why?
Stanley : It's a money thing. We don't have any.
Joey : You're kidding, right?
UNK: What?
Stanley : It's probably just temporary.
UNK: We're hoping to get some money soon. Just hang out.
Joey : Hang out? How long?
Stanley : I don't know. A week. Maybe two. The money will turn up.
UNK: People always wanna invest in movies. You're not rich?
Stanley : Worth a shot.
UNK: Well, Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
UNK: The Grip : Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?
UNK: These got left for you.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: "Congratulations on your big break."
Joey : -Monica, it's Joey. -Hey, Joey.
UNK: You remember me even though you're a star.
Joey : Come on. It'll be years before I forget you.
Monica : What's it like on a movie set?
Monica : Do you have a dressing room and a chair with your name?
UNK: Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.
UNK: Tell Chandler he couldn't have been more wrong.
UNK: I gotta go, Monica. My sushi's here.
Joey : Sorry about that. Thanks for waiting.
Joey : Everybody smile.
Joey : Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay at Caesars. We hope it's toga-rific.
Joey : Kill me. Kill me now.
Ross : Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
UNK: Go!
Rachel : What are you doing? Get off! Oh, my God!
UNK: Hold it open. Okay.
Monica : We'll see you in about three or four hours.
