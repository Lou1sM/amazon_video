Rachel : Hey, Dave.
UNK: I need to take a rain check. My roommate is really sick.
Rachel : Okay. Bye!
Rachel : Honey, listen.
Rachel : I know things seem so bad...
UNK: ...and that they won't get any
UNK: Could I talk to you?
Monica : I dropped some socks.
Monica : What is the matter with you? Do you want to fall into the trap?
Rachel : You did not drop any socks!
UNK: I saw Dave, and he said you blew him off!
Monica : You listen to me!
Monica : I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
UNK: What are you doing?
Rachel : Well, ultimately I was trying, you know, I wanted...
UNK: ...to tell him that I'm still in love with him.
Monica : What? You cannot tell him that!
Rachel : Why? Why not?
Rachel : People love to hear that!
UNK: Come on, I love you.
UNK: -Wasn't that nice? -No.
Monica : I make the decisions and I say no!
UNK: You know what? No, you don't make my decisions, because...
Rachel : ...you're fired.
Monica : You can't fire me.
Monica : I make your decisions, and I say I'm not fired! Ha!
UNK: Well...
Monica : Come on, let me in!
UNK: Having some trouble?
Monica : Rachel locked the door.
Joey : I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.
UNK: Ross, there's something I wanna talk to you about.
Rachel : -I just need to -Rachel, open this door!
UNK: -What, is it locked? -She's fine. Listen...
UNK: Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!
UNK: -You want me to get that? -No. Just let her do her thing...
UNK: ...and we'll do our thing. Because I really need to tell you
Monica : Thank you.
Monica : Rachel? Can I talk to you outside for a sec?
UNK: We really need to talk.
Rachel : Well, then talk.
Monica : Okay, I will.
UNK: Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Ross : What thing?
Monica : Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.
Monica : Which I think is a really stupid idea.
Monica : It's dangerous. She won't get what she wants.
Monica : And who knows who she might end up hurting?
Ross : Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.
UNK: I have to use the phone.
Ross : I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
Ross : My God! Think of the massacre.
UNK: I'm going to do it.
Monica : I know you think I'm crazy.
UNK: But before you tell him, try to find one person...
UNK: ...who thinks it's a good idea. I bet you can't.
UNK: Please?
Rachel : All right. Fine.
Monica : Joey! I'm in!
Joey : All right. Good deal.
UNK: -Hi. -Hey, Rach.
UNK: -Did you find anyone who agrees with you? -No.
UNK: But you know what? I think I need a male point of view.
UNK: Joey.
UNK: -You're a man. -You got that right.
