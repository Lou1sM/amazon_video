UNK: Do you think it would be a good idea if I told Ross that I was still in love with him?
UNK: Nope.
UNK: -Phoebe! -Hey, Phoebe.
UNK: -Phoebe? -Yeah.
UNK: You know how you were saying you didn't get to go to London...
UNK: ...and you were feeling left out?
UNK: Well, we all felt really bad about that...
UNK: ...so we decided to take a little trip together!
UNK: Oh, that's so nice!
Phoebe : How great! Where's the trip?
Monica : Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic...
Monica : ...in Central Park!
Monica : Central Park?
Joey : All of us. All day.
Phoebe : That sucks!
Phoebe : That's not a trip! I just came from there.
UNK: What'll we high-five about at the stupid park?
Phoebe : It's right by my house. All right!
UNK: I'm going home to bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
UNK: Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.
UNK: I wanted to talk to you about...
UNK: ...this whole new European thing you've got going on.
UNK: And I need to say it makes me very uncomfortable...
UNK: ...and I just, you know, just stop it!
UNK: Just bringing some culture to the group.
Rachel : That's fine. Just don't bring it in my mouth.
UNK: It makes me want to puke.
Ross : Hey, everybody! Phoebe is here!
Rachel : -Phoebe! Woo! -Okay. Woo! Hi!
UNK: Phoebe, we decided that the picnic idea was a little...
Chandler : It didn't have any... Well, it blew.
UNK: We thought that this afternoon we'd all go away for the whole weekend...
Chandler : ...to Atlantic City.
Phoebe : Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Whose plan was that?
UNK: Mine!
Ross : -Wait. It was my plan. -No...
Joey : ...I said we needed a new plan.
Ross : And I came up with Atlantic City.
Joey : Which is the new plan.
Monica : Why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour.
UNK: I'm going to go pack. I'm going to go pack my ass off.
UNK: Well, I think I'm gonna grab some coffee because my ass is already packed.
Ross : Let's go.
UNK: You know what? I'll meet you in a minute.
Monica : Rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.
UNK: You know what? That doesn't matter.
UNK: Do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love them...
Monica : ...and not have them say it back?
Rachel : I don't care.
Monica : I can't watch.
UNK: What you reading?
UNK: Paper.
Rachel : Yeah? What's it about?
Ross : Events from around the globe.
Rachel : There's something I have to talk to you about.
UNK: Everyone's saying I shouldn't.
Rachel : But I think they're wrong. People can be wrong.
Ross : Once at work...
Ross : ...I thought carbon dating is fossilized
Rachel : I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Ross : Go ahead.
UNK: I think I'm just going to say it.
UNK: I'm just going to say it.
Rachel : I'm still in love with you, Ross.
Ross : I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Ross : What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.
Rachel : I'm so dead serious!
Rachel : I'm totally serious!
Ross : Why are you laughing?
Rachel : Because I just heard it!
Rachel : I heard it. And it's ridiculous!
Ross : I mean...
Rachel : You're married!
Rachel : You're married, and it's just ridiculous!
UNK: When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.
Rachel : And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel...
UNK: I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Ross : -Well, I am married. -I know.
UNK: Though I haven't spoken to her since the wedding.
Rachel : I'm sorry. That's not funny.
