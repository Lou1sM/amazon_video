Joey : Say that to him, and you're golden.
UNK: Hey, Phoebe. We got our pictures back from London.
Monica : Here's all of us at the Tower of London...
Phoebe : Here we all are.
Phoebe : There's Ross and Joey and you and
Phoebe : And me.
Chandler : We've been talking about London too much.
UNK: Sorry, it's just because I couldn't be there.
UNK: All I get to do now is pregnant stuff. It bums me out.
Phoebe : -I'm sorry. -Sorry.
UNK: Know what I like to do? It sounds a little corny...
UNK: ...but sometimes when I'm bummed out, I like to just close my eyes...
UNK: ...and think about what a wonderful gift life is.
UNK: See?
Monica : -What happened? -A little of this, a little of that.
UNK: I got myself a date tomorrow.
Monica : See? Didn't I tell you? You're getting over Ross already.
Chandler : Get out.
UNK: What took so long?
UNK: I got caught up at work. But I'm quitting tomorrow.
Chandler : So thanks for having me over.
UNK: See you, man.
Joey : What the hell was that?
UNK: Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.
Rachel : That's not European.
Phoebe : It felt French.
UNK: Well, I guess it's time for me to say goodbye too, mon frere.
UNK: Come here and give me a little sugar.
Rachel : I really had a good time.
Dave : Yeah, me too.
Dave : I guess this is it.
UNK: Unless you want to come inside?
UNK: Wait a minute. You know what? I can't decide this.
Rachel : Okay. Just hold on a second.
UNK: Where's Monica? I have to ask her something.
Ross : Doing her laundry.
Rachel : What's that?
Ross : It came in the mail today.
Ross : It's 72 long-stemmed red roses.
Ross : One for each day I've known and loved Emily...
Ross : ...cut up into mulch.
Rachel : Honey, that's awful.
Ross : It's not so bad.
UNK: Monica's going to make potpourri.
UNK: I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
Rachel : It's not raining.
Ross : I can't catch a break!
Rachel : You're not going anywhere. Sit right here.
UNK: I'll make you some tea and we'll talk this out.
Joey : All right?
