Ross : No one will tell me where Emily is...
UNK: ...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red roses to her parents' house.
Ross : One for each day I've known and loved her.
UNK: That should get her talking.
UNK: When you make out the card, be sure to make it out to "Emily."
UNK: It's good that you had such a good time in Greece.
UNK: What?
Rachel : I didn't have a good time in Greece!
Rachel : Ross abandoned me!
Rachel : I couldn't get a plane out. I had to stay in their suite!
UNK: People came up to me going, "Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"
UNK: I mean, it was so humiliating!
Rachel : I felt like such an idiot!
Rachel : It's all my fault. You know why?
Rachel : Because I make very bad decisions.
Chandler : Oh, that's not true.
UNK: Yes, it is true. I went after Ross in stupid London!
Phoebe : London is stupid! Stupid!
UNK: I put on a cheerleading outfit to seduce Joshua.
UNK: Then I lost him because I asked him to marry me after four dates.
UNK: And then I went to Greece on somebody else's honeymoon. Okay?
UNK: Do those sound like very good decisions to you?
UNK: I like your little braid.
UNK: I just shouldn't be allowed to make decisions anymore.
Rachel : Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London.
Rachel : From now on, you make all my decisions for me.
Rachel : Oh, no. I did that for someone once.
Phoebe : I'm not comfortable having that power over someone's life.
Monica : I'll do it.
UNK: Fine. Monica, you are now in charge of my love life.
UNK: Okay. I got to go to work.
UNK: And Rachel, great to have you back.
Chandler : Always a pleasure.
Monica : Rachel? Sweetie, look.
UNK: Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.
Rachel : He's married.
Rachel : Ross is married. I still can't believe it.
Monica : Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
UNK: I'll just have to accept it.
Rachel : I mean, it's my fault.
UNK: Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: That's okay. I know that you're very upset right now.
Monica : I know that wasn't about me.
Joey : I bet it was about her a little.
Monica : If you'd stop thinking about Ross...
UNK: ...you'd notice there are great guys everywhere.
Monica : Look. Gunther.
Monica : He's nice. He's cute.
Rachel : Yeah. I guess Gunther is...
Monica : What about that guy over there?
UNK: That's the guy you flirted with at the counter.
Rachel : -Oh, I don't know. I don't know. -You're going to talk to him.
Monica : I make your decisions, and I say you're going to talk to him.
Joey : All right.
Rachel : You're the boss. I got to do what you tell me.
