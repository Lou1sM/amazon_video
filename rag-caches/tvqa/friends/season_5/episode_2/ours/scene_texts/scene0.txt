Monica : You look cute in bubbles.
UNK: You're just all liquored up.
UNK: Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.
Chandler : I've had a very long, hard day.
UNK: -You're home early. -Yeah, my date threw up.
UNK: Want some chicken?
Chandler : No, thanks. No chicken. Bye-bye.
Joey : You sure? Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?
Chandler : For the last time, no! Get out, Joey!
Joey : All right.
Chandler : Are you okay? He wouldn't leave.
UNK: He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.
UNK: Chicken?
Monica : I could eat some chicken.
