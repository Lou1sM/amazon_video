UNK: Could I get a three-piece, some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?
UNK: Diet Coke.
UNK: The One With All the Kissing
UNK: What?
UNK: He was a cabdriver we had in London.
Phoebe : All right. Anyway
UNK: What was that pub he took us to?
UNK: The Wheat Sheaf!
Joey : And they had that beer...
UNK: Boddington's!
UNK: Phoebe was going to tell a story.
Phoebe : So he had a really funny hat.
Phoebe : I don't want to talk about it.
UNK: -Hey. -Hey, Ross!
UNK: Boddington's!
UNK: Oh, man!
Joey : I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
UNK: They have them at the British pub by the Trade Center.
UNK: Later!
UNK: Shouldn't Rachel be back?
Monica : Her plane got delayed.
UNK: But she should be here by now.
Ross : So you talked to her? Did she sound mad?
Monica : No. But she likes me.
Monica : You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
UNK: I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?
Ross : Emily showed up at the airport.
Ross : I had to go after her. I did what I had to do.
Ross : She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.
UNK: Emily!
Ross : Emily is my wife.
Ross : Man, what is that?
UNK: You haven't heard from Emily?
Ross : Not since I lost her at the airport.
UNK: I can't believe she can outrun you.
Ross : Hey! She's fast, okay?
UNK: You think you can beat me? Let's go! Outside!
UNK: -I'm sorry. I'm just a little -Slow?
UNK: Oh, you want some?!
UNK: Okay, get the shoes on! Let's go, man!
UNK: It's cool, okay?
UNK: You're the fastest!
UNK: -Hi! -Oh, my God, Rachel!
Ross : Rach, I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry.
Rachel : Come on. You just did what you had to do.
Ross : That's it? You're not mad? It must've been terrible.
Rachel : Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!
UNK: There was a nice hotel, nice beach, met the nice people.
UNK: It's not too shabby for Rachel.
Ross : So, what, that's it?
Rachel : We're cool. Totally cool.
UNK: Thanks, Rach. You're the best.
Rachel : Oh, no. You're the best.
UNK: Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
