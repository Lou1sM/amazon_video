Joey : All right. Here we go! 1999, the year of Joey.
Chandler : We're very happy for you.
Joey : What's the matter?
Chandler : We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else will, so...
Joey : All right, I'll take care of it.
UNK: It's 30 seconds to midnight, what are you gonna do?
UNK: Will you just trust me?
UNK: Thirty-three, 32, 31
Joey : Who are you kissing at midnight? Rachel or Phoebe?
Joey : You can't kiss your sister.
Ross : -Who's gonna kiss my sister? -Chandler.
UNK: Oh, man! Really?
Joey : Would you rather have me or him kiss her?
Ross : That's a good point.
Ross : Since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
UNK: Phoebe! Listen. Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.
