UNK: Phoebe, you may know this. You know strange things.
UNK: What is the boiling point of brain?
UNK: I used to know this.
UNK: I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.
Ross : I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
Ross : I would make a good cowboy.
Monica : Now that everything's wrapped up, I'll do my laundry.
Chandler : Yeah, me too. If this shirt is dirty.
UNK: I'm going to the airport.
Phoebe : If I hang around there long enough...
Phoebe : ...someone's bound to leave a plane unattended.
Rachel : -Good luck, honey. -Bye.
UNK: Remember that thing I was gonna tell you about?
UNK: I won't tell you. But if you found out on your own...
Rachel : ...that would be okay and we could talk about it.
Joey : Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So that would be okay.
UNK: Would you mind going into Chandler's bedroom...
UNK: ...and getting that book he borrowed from me?
Joey : Now? You want me to go over there now?
Joey : -Do you know something? -Do you?
Joey : -I might know something. -I might too.
UNK: -What do you know? -You tell me first.
Monica : -I can't. -Then I can't.
Joey : Okay, fine.
Joey : You don't know.
UNK: I'll walk into his bedroom and see the thing...
UNK: ...I think I know is actually the thing I think I know!
Chandler : -You know! -And you know!
Joey : Yeah, I know!
Rachel : Chandler and Monica? Oh, this is unbelievable!
Rachel : -How long have you known? -Too long!
Joey : I've been dying to talk to someone about this!
UNK: You can't say anything to anybody. They're so weird about that.
Phoebe : It's raining.
UNK: I don't like to fly in the rain.
UNK: I am gonna go for a walk in the rain.
Chandler : Me too.
Phoebe : That's weird.
Phoebe : I bet they're doing it.
UNK: Okay, look. I can't take it anymore.
Chandler : So you win. Okay? Here.
Chandler : Flying a jet? Make it a spaceship...
UNK: ...so you can get back to your home planet!
UNK: Phone call for you. Tom Jones. He wants his pants back!
Chandler : And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating a character from Fraggle Rock?
