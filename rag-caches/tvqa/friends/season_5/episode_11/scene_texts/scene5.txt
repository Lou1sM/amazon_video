Joey : Have you?
Ross : Oh, my God!
Joey : What? I didn't touch a guitar!
Phoebe : But you're questioning my method!
Joey : No, I'm not questioning it. I'm saying it's stupid!
UNK: What?
Monica : Thank you.
UNK: You know, none of my other student...
Phoebe : ...thought I was stupid.
Joey : Your other student was you!
UNK: Well, maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Joey : Maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Joey : Here! Andy Cooper. He teaches guitar.
UNK: There's a picture of him with a kid.

Joey : Chandler's not here.
Ross : You can help me.
Ross : I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.
UNK: Nice!
UNK: No, I got really hot in my pants, so I took them off.
Ross : But they must have shrunk from the sweat.
Ross : Or my legs expanded from the heat.
UNK: I can't get them back on, Joey. I can't!
Joey : That is quite a situation.
UNK: Do you see any powder?
UNK: Powder! Yeah, I have powder.
UNK: Good, good.
UNK: Sprinkle some on. It'll absorb moisture.
UNK: Then you can get your pants on.
UNK: Yeah, hold on.
