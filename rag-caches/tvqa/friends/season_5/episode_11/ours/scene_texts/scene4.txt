Phoebe : Oh, this must be killing you!
Ross : All right, see you later.
UNK: Not really.
UNK: -I haven't told you her middle name yet. -Well, don't. Just don't.
Ross : -See you later. -See you.
UNK: All right, Phoebe, I am ready for my first lesson.
Phoebe : No, you don't touch the guitar.
UNK: First you learn here, then here.
UNK: Lesson one : Chords.
UNK: Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords.
UNK: But I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.
UNK: So then this is "Bear Claw."
UNK: "Turkey Leg"...
UNK: ...and "Old Lady."
Chandler : What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.
UNK: You know, some might find it amusing. I myself find it regular.
Phoebe : Hey, everybody!
Phoebe : Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Joey : I didn't. Even when I found out
UNK: Let's say I found out something about someone...
Rachel : ...and let's just say...
Rachel : ...she's gonna keep it.
Joey : Check this out.
Phoebe : You nailed the Old Lady!
Joey : I thought I was getting better, so I stopped by this guitar store
Phoebe : Did you touch any of the guitars there?
Phoebe : Did you?
UNK: No.
Phoebe : Give me your hands.
UNK: Strings.
UNK: Pick.
Phoebe : -Do you want to learn to play guitar? -Yes.
Phoebe : Then don't touch one!
Monica : -Hi, Ben. -Auntie Monica!
Chandler : Ross is wearing leather pants!
Chandler : Does nobody else see Ross is wearing leather pants?
Chandler : Someone comment on the pants!
Rachel : -I think they're very nice. -I really like them a lot.
Chandler : Not what I had in mind.
UNK: People like Ross don't wear these types of pants.
Chandler : You see, they're very tight.
Chandler : Maybe there's something in that area?
UNK: I think they look really good.
UNK: Where'd you get them?
Ross : I needed a new thing for today.
Ross : There's this leather store that always smells so good.
UNK: And I thought to myself : "Wow. I've never owned...
UNK: ...a really good-smelling pair of pants before."
Chandler : Oh, come on!
Ross : What do you think?
Joey : You look like a freak.
UNK: Awful!
