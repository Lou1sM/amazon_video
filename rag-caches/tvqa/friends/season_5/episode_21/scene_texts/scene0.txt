UNK: I'll get coffee. Want anything, baby doll?
Phoebe : I'm fine. Thanks.
UNK: I can't pull off "baby doll," can I?
Monica : No, I think we learned that from the "sugar lips" incident.
UNK: I'll make some tea.
UNK: How you doing, pumpkin?
UNK: -So it's going well for you two? -I know. Really well.
Gary : I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Gary : What do you think?
UNK: It's great! When will you ask her?
Gary : Tonight. But don't say anything.
Monica : I swear. I promise.
Monica : I'm so excited!
UNK: But listen, do not get her flowers, okay?
UNK: Because she cries when they die. Then there's the whole funeral.
