Ross : Let's do it.
Joey : I have to pee.
Joey : And Rachel's in the bathroom!
UNK: Man, I didn't think we'd make it.
Gary : I know.
Ross : Don't switch hands, okay?
Chandler : Hey, ladies. What are you in here for?
Gary : What are you doing here?
UNK: I am here to report a crime.
UNK: It's a crime that we don't spend time together.
Gary : What's up?
UNK: You're thinking about moving in with Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.
UNK: You know, man to...
UNK: ...well, me.
Gary : Sure, okay.
Chandler : Are you crazy?
Chandler : Are you insane?
Chandler : If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be living together.
Gary : I considered that. It'd make me happy.
Chandler : -You mean scared. -No, I mean happy.
Chandler : Scared happy.
Gary : What are you doing?
UNK: I'm trying to open your eyes!
Chandler : If you live with Phoebe, she is always gonna be there.
UNK: You get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there.
Chandler : You wake up and, oh, yes, she's there.
Gary : I know. I can't wait!
UNK: Were your parents happy or something?
Gary : I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love.
UNK: I just want to be around her as much as I can.
Chandler : When you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
UNK: You know what I'm saying?
Chandler : Yeah, I think I do.
UNK: [scene : You know what?
UNK: Move in with her. Move in right now. Maybe I'll move in with Monica.
Gary : No, it's too soon for you guys.
Chandler : You're right about that.
Ross : When they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon...
Ross : ...they discovered what appeared to be the remains...
Ross : ...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.
Ross : How did it get there?
Joey : Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Monica : Hey, guys.
UNK: I left my watch here last night.
UNK: -It was here. Where is it? -I don't know.
Monica : I'm late for work.
Ross : How do you know? You don't have a watch.
UNK: Can you stop throwing the ball for one minute and help me find it?
Joey : Oh, I don't know... Yeah, can't do it.
UNK: -What? -Do not drop that ball.
Joey : We haven't dropped it in...
UNK: Two hours, 27 minutes.
UNK: Really?
UNK: I won't make it in to work today.
Monica : I don't feel very good.
UNK: For a second, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.
Ross : Hey, Rach.
UNK: Check it out. Almost three hours without dropping it.
UNK: Congratulations. That's quite a waste of time.
Monica : You have scratches all over you.
Rachel : Well, it's my cat.
UNK: -Oh, I got a cat. -I don't want a cat!
Joey : Don't worry, it's not a cat.
Rachel : You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
Rachel : It's not sweet. It's not cute.
UNK: I dragged a string, and it flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.
Rachel : I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me...
Rachel : ...I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Ross : Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.
UNK: You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me $300?
Rachel : Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
