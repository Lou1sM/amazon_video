Phoebe : Did you talk to Gary about moving in?
Chandler : I think you should do it.
UNK: He's a great guy and he loves you a lot. You are a very lucky lady.
Phoebe : You are useless!
Phoebe : Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do...
Phoebe : ...and you can't even do that right!
UNK: Sorry. If he asked me, I'd move in with him.
UNK: Get out of here, good-for-nothing.
Gary : Hey, Chandler.
Chandler : Hey, Gar.
UNK: Hey, sweetie.
Gary : Can I talk to you for a second?
UNK: You look pretty today.
Phoebe : Thanks. Okay.
Gary : Here's the thing.
UNK: I really want this relationship to move forward.
Gary : If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards.
UNK: No, if you're not moving forward, you're staying still.
Phoebe : And staying still is good. Watch this.
Gary : I want you to move in with me.
Monica : That is so sweet.
Phoebe : But don't you think it's too soon?
Phoebe : There's so much we don't know about each other.
Gary : Okay. I get it.
Phoebe : I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for.
Monica : I don't want to mess up what we have.
Phoebe : I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Phoebe : Which is why my answer is yes!
UNK: Really?
UNK: You're so happy.
Ross : Monica, stop throwing it so hard!
Ross : We're on the same team!
Chandler : You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Joey : That's right, baby.
Chandler : -All right. Let me in. -No, no! Don't do it!
UNK: What?
Monica : He's a dropper.
Joey : Oh, yeah. That's right!
Chandler : I'm not a dropper!
UNK: It's really a three-person game, you know?
Chandler : It's throwing and catching.
Monica : All right.
UNK: Oh, it's so hard.
UNK: Don't worry, guys. It's not a cat.
Monica : Oh, good God!
UNK: I give up. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.
Ross : Baking it didn't help?
Monica : Take it back to where you got it.
Rachel : I tried. They won't take her back.
Chandler : Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.
Monica : Why won't they take it?
UNK: They said they would only give me store credit.
UNK: What am I gonna do? Get 1000 regular cats?
UNK: You said it was a show cat. Why don't you show it, win some prize money.
UNK: Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter, and all you win are these ribbons...
UNK: ...which technically belong to the damn cat.
UNK: You can keep it until you find out what to do with it.
Rachel : That's not the point. I'm out $1000...
Rachel : ...I'm all scratched up...
Rachel : ...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Monica : Oh, my God!
Monica : The cat's made my eyes water. Don't throw it to me!
Monica : My vision's been compromised!
Monica : Oh, God! Okay.
Monica : It's okay. Man, that was close.
Chandler : Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Gary : -We have great news. -We're moving in together. Yay!
UNK: Congratulations.
Monica : -I'm so excited! -So am I.
Phoebe : You're not more excited than I am. No way. I'm the most excited.
Gary : See you at the station later.
Phoebe : I'll see you later. Don't forget about the moving-in!
