Monica : So you're moving in with him?
Phoebe : I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right.
UNK: I do like him a lot...
Phoebe : ...and probably do it eventually, anyway.
Phoebe : Plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Monica : Do you write him a lot?
UNK: I heard when people live together...
Phoebe : ...they split the cost of stamps, don't they?
Ross : -Yeah, yeah. -That's right.
Phoebe : Sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Gary : Hey, honey.
Gary : Did you find any apartments in Brooklyn Heights?
Phoebe : No, nothing.
Gary : -Oh, really? -Yeah.
Gary : -Nothing at all? -No.
UNK: If something opens up, we'll move in. If it has a pool. I need a pool.
Gary : Can I talk to you?
Gary : Take a seat.
Gary : You okay?
UNK: You feel all right?
UNK: I feel great, because we're moving in together.
Gary : So you...
Gary : You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
Gary : You checked the Post?
UNK: Yeah, there was nothing.
Phoebe : -Can I get some water? -In a minute.
Gary : You checked today's Post?
Phoebe : Yeah, today's.
UNK: Because this is today's Post.
Gary : And these are the listings I found.
UNK: Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
UNK: Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
UNK: Oh, are these for rent? I thought people were just bragging.
UNK: Let me tell you what's going on here.
Gary : Don't look at the table. Look at me.
Gary : Somebody asked someone to move in with him.
UNK: Someone said yes, but now she has doubts...
UNK: ...because things are moving too fast. Does that sound possible?
Phoebe : Yes, fine! I am someone!
Phoebe : You want me to say it? I have doubts!
Phoebe : I'm sorry!
Gary : It's okay that you feel this way.
UNK: It is soon, and there's things we don't know about each other.
UNK: Everything I know about you, I really like.
UNK: Things I don't know, I'll learn in a place with our names on the mailbox.
Phoebe : That's so sweet.
UNK: But if it's too soon for you, we don't have to do it.
Gary : I want you to be happy.
Phoebe : Living with you would make me happy.
Gary : You don't have to say that.
UNK: I want to live with you. I want to move in with you.
Gary : Are you sure?
Phoebe : Definitely, yes! Let's live in an apartment we both live in.
Gary : Oh, that's great.
Phoebe : Oh, wait, one sec.
Phoebe : Hey, you! Behind the glass. Who are you looking at?
UNK: I always wanted to say that every time I was in these rooms, which was never.
Rachel : Show cat!
Rachel : Quality show cat!
Rachel : -Show cat! -Oh, my God!
UNK: Woman No. 1 : What's wrong with your baby?
UNK: That's not a baby. That's a cat.
UNK: -It's creepy-looking. -Oh, no.
UNK: It's actually very sweet. It's very sweet. Look.
Rachel : Yeah. Do you want it?
UNK: Woman No. 1 : No, I hate cats.
Rachel : Then what are you doing to me?
Rachel : Get out of here, all right? Move on!
UNK: Woman No. 2 : What an unusual cat.
Rachel : Yes, thank you! Exactly. You want it?
UNK: Maybe.
UNK: Woman No. 2 : I was thinking about getting a cat from the shelter, but...
UNK: Woman No. 2 : -Okay. Why not? -Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
UNK: -What? -Okay, 1000.
UNK: Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?
UNK: I do, but you'll have to look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Phoebe : Okay, yeah. I just wanted a cat.
