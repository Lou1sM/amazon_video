Gary : -I'll see you after work, sweetie. -Okay. Bye.
Phoebe : So, what movie should we see?
Monica : Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!
Phoebe : What? Really?
Monica : He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Phoebe : I can't believe this.
Chandler : Right? Because it's fast. Because it's so fast. It's fast.
Monica : Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.
UNK: Good for you, Phoebe. Way to go.
Phoebe : No, but it is fast, isn't it?
UNK: -I like him, but I'm not ready. -So, what are you gonna do?
Phoebe : I don't know. I'll just handle it. I'll ask you to talk to him!
Chandler : Me? Why me?
Phoebe : Because you are so afraid of commitment.
Phoebe : You talk to him. Make him scared like you, make him a man.
Chandler : I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it'd do.
UNK: I'm less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Monica : That is so sweet.
Chandler : Still terrified. I'll take care of it.
UNK: Hey, Ross, is Staten Island really an island?
Ross : That's why they call it Staten "Island."
UNK: Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.
Ross : Also an island.
Joey : -What time is it? -2 : 17.
Joey : We haven't dropped this ball for an hour.
Ross : Are you serious?
UNK: I realized it a half-hour ago, but I didn't say anything.
UNK: I didn't wanna jinx it.
Ross : We are pretty good at this.
Ross : We totally forgot about lunch.
Joey : That's the first time I've ever missed a meal.
UNK: I think my pants are a little loose.
UNK: Hey, you guys. Is Monica here?
UNK: I bought something. I'm not sure she'll like it.
UNK: It may seem crazy, but I've wanted this since I was a little girl.
UNK: You bought Shaun Cassidy!
UNK: No. I wish!
Rachel : Okay, you ready?
Rachel : Check it out.
Ross : What is it?
Joey : What the hell is that?
Rachel : It's a cat.
Joey : That is not a cat!
Rachel : Yes, it is!
Ross : Why is it inside out?
Rachel : Excuse me!
Rachel : But this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat.
Ross : How much did you pay for that?
UNK: It was extravagant, but I got a good deal.
Ross : -How much? -Thousand bucks.
Ross : On a cat?
Joey : It's not a cat!
UNK: For a thousand dollars, you'd think at least it'd come with hair.
Chandler : Or something.
Rachel : All right. Listen, ball boys.
UNK: My grandma had one when I was little. It was the sweetest thing.
Rachel : It would sit in my lap and just purr all day long.
UNK: I would drag a string and it would chase it.
UNK: Free cats do that too, you know.
Joey : It's not a cat!
Rachel : I'm really excited about this, okay? I don't care what you think.
UNK: I'm gonna set up a litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.
Rachel : What am I gonna call her? Fluffy?
UNK: Do you wanna get something to eat, or see how long we can throw this ball?
Joey : The ball thing.
Joey : Wouldn't it be great if we could go for two hours without dropping it?
Ross : Yeah, it would!
