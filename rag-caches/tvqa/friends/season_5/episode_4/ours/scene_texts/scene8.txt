UNK: -Really? -Oh, my God!
Chandler : I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.
Chandler : But that would be wrong.
Chandler : We're too good.
Chandler : We owe it to sex!
Monica : If we owe it!
Rachel : Oh, my!
UNK: When will Joey be home?
UNK: I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.
UNK: No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.
UNK: I cleaned the bathroom.
Chandler : Why don't we lose the gloves.
Ross : All right. Let's show them how it's done.
UNK: -You know that wasn't part of it? -I know.
Rachel : You ready? We're going to be late.
Ross : -For what? -For Stella, remember?
UNK: She's getting her groove back in 20 minutes.
Ross : I totally forgot about that.
UNK: Can I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Rachel : Sure, I guess.
Rachel : I hear you don't have to go to London.
Ross : It's not that easy. There's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Rachel : Like what?
Ross : Just stuff.
UNK: You know, kind of what Emily wants.
Ross : Talk to me. Maybe I can help.
Ross : You can't help.
UNK: I have to do this without your help.
Rachel : I know you can do that too. I'm just saying if you need to talk...
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Whatever it is that Emily wants...
Rachel : ...just give it to her.
UNK: The bottom line is that you love her.
Rachel : Fix whatever she wants fixed.
Rachel : Just do it.
UNK: You're going to have to try. You'll hate yourself if you don't.
Rachel : Come on, answer it!
Ross : Hi, sweetie.
UNK: Good.
Ross : Yes, I've been thinking...
Ross : ...about that thing you wanted me to do.
Ross : I can do it.
Ross : Will you come to New York?
Monica : -Never done that before. -Nope.
