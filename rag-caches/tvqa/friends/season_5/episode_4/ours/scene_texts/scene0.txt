Rachel : Hi, I just
Rachel : Oh, my God! Monica!
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: I'm sorry! I was
Monica : I was taking a nap.
UNK: Since when do you take naps in that position?
Rachel : Tell me you were waiting for a guy. Please tell me.
Monica : Yes, I was. A guy.
Monica : From work.
Monica : I'm seeing a guy from work!
UNK: That cute waiter guy that looks like a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?
Monica : That one!
Rachel : Give me a second. I'm just going to grab a jacket.
Rachel : When I get back, I want every little detail.
Rachel : Maybe that's him.
Monica : It's just Joey and Ross.
UNK: Why aren't you at the movie?
UNK: Ross was so loud, they threw us out.
Ross : I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Joey : -He's talking to London. -Did he get in touch with Emily?
UNK: No, not yet. He's hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Ross : I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
Joey : Way to suck up to the family!
UNK: I'm so glad you're all here. My office finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. Is this 0-1-1-4-4-7-4-2...
UNK: ...9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7?
UNK: Oh, it's "4-3," not 4-2.
UNK: Well, which 4-2?
UNK: No, no! Vomit tux!
Joey : Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Chandler : Vomit tux?
Monica : Who vomited on?
UNK: You know what? What you up to, Joe?
UNK: They're doing this telethon thing on TV.
Joey : And my agent got me a job as cohost!
Monica : That's great!
Joey : A little good deed for PBS, plus some TV exposure.
Joey : That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.
UNK: Oh, PBS!
Monica : -What's wrong with PBS? -What's right with them?
UNK: Why don't you like PBS?
Phoebe : Right after my Mom killed herself, I was in a bad place, personally.
UNK: I thought I'd write to Sesame Street.
UNK: Because they were nice when I was a little kid.
Phoebe : No one ever wrote back.
Chandler : A lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.
Phoebe : All I got was a lousy key chain, and by that time, I was living in a box.
