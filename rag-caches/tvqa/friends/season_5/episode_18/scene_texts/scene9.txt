Chandler : Great job with the cups.
Monica : Why don't you just go out with her?
UNK: Did you notice the ice? Look!
Phoebe : We have it all. We have crushed, cubed and dry. Watch.
UNK: Mystical.
UNK: No one's eating my food. They're eating her snow cones!
Chandler : There are snow cones?
Ross : -Go, go! -Thank you.
UNK: -You really did do a nice job. -Thank you...
UNK: ...for stating the obvious.
UNK: I deserve that.
UNK: I just want you to know that if we ever cohost a party together again...
UNK: -...you can do whatever you want. -Joey's got a birthday coming up.
UNK: -Really? What do you wanna do? -Okay, I'd like to be in charge of beer.
UNK: Well, then there's nothing left for me.
Phoebe : -Look, look! -Surprise!
UNK: What? My birthday is not for another month.
Monica : That's the surprise.
Rachel : Oh, my God, you guys! This is so great! It's so unexpected.
Rachel : I mean, Chandler's birthday is even before mine.
UNK: Surprise!
Rachel : This is so great! Look at all these...
UNK: ...cups.
Rachel : This is so weird.
Phoebe : I was in charge of cups.
Rachel : Oh, okay. Not so weird.
UNK: -Chandler, what are you doing? -Nothing.
UNK: -What's in your hand? -Money. I'm stealing all the money.
UNK: Chandler.
UNK: But just one, okay? Because nobody knows when my birthday is.
UNK: Let me make this clear to you, okay?
UNK: It's either that...
Ross : ...or this.
UNK: They were menthol.
Ross : Listen, man. I'm sorry the audition didn't go well.
Joey : Yeah, right.
UNK: No, really. I am, Joey. I feel bad.
Joey : Look, Ross. You don't have to, okay?
Joey : It's not your fault I suck.
Joey : What kind of an actor can't even say, "Mmm...noodle soup"?
UNK: You know what? Maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck.
Ross : Maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson.
UNK: What do you mean?
Ross : I think, subconsciously
Joey : You lost me.
Ross : I think, on some level, you sabotaged...
Ross : ...your own audition so Ben would get the part.
UNK: Your way sounds a lot better than mine.
Joey : It's not that I'm a bad actor.
UNK: No, it's just that I care so damn much about little Ben...
Joey : ...that it was more important for me to see him succeed.
Ross : -There you go. Thank you. -Thank you.
UNK: -So did he get it? -No.
Joey : What are you gonna do?
Chandler : Is Rachel Green here? I'm meeting her for lunch.
UNK: She doesn't come down anymore. You'll find her on 10.
Phoebe : Okay, great.
Kim : So we talked about the presentation.
Kim : He wondered if one person would be enough.
Kim : And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."
Chandler : I'll catch you guys later.
