UNK: So here's what...
UNK: Are you sure that I haven't seen you somewhere before?
UNK: No, I haven't been in any plays.
UNK: The Casting Director : All right, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
UNK: The Casting Director : Is there a problem?
Joey : Well, this is noodle soup. And I've been working with tomato.
Joey : But that's okay. No problem.
UNK: Mmm...noodle soup.
UNK: You know, that's fine. But the line is, "Mmm...soup."
UNK: -What'd I say? -"Mmm...noodle soup."
Joey : How's that different?
UNK: The Casting Director : All right. Let's try one.
UNK: Mmm...
Joey : ...noodle soup.
UNK: The Casting Director : Let's do it again.
UNK: Mmm...soup.
Joey : I mean, noodle soup. I mean, soup!
Joey : Come on!
UNK: You know what? We need to move on.
UNK: No, I could do it one more time.
UNK: Look.
UNK: Mmm...noodle soup.
UNK: Damn it!
UNK: So I think that if we get these samples into the magazine by Monday, we'll be fine.
UNK: Sounds good. So, Rach, how you doing?
UNK: -I'm great! -No, with the not-smoking thing.
UNK: Kill me now.
UNK: Let me tell you something, I ate 40 Mallomars today.
UNK: I mean, I have patches all over my body, you know?
UNK: -I mean, I haven't slept in two days. -We quit yesterday.
UNK: That's counting today.
UNK: But anyway, so these samples, I think
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: I'm so sorry, I forgot. I have to go to the mailroom and mail some proofs.
UNK: Go ahead. Rachel and I will just sit here and keep brainstorming.
UNK: Also, Vogue called. And they were wondering
UNK: You know what? I'm a little hungry. I'm just gonna run down to the vending machines.
Joey : All right.
UNK: Busted!
UNK: Come on! What are you doing? I thought we were the Patch Sisters.
Kim : That didn't work out.
Monica : Wait a minute. What about all we've talked about?
UNK: You know, the disgusting place, the ugly people.
UNK: Hey, how you doing?
Nancy : We tried to quit. But it was too hard.
Rachel : If you started smoking again, you could have at least told me.
Rachel : Give me one. What are we talking about?
UNK: Don't you give up.
Kim : That's why we didn't tell you, and we won't drag you down.
UNK: Wait. No, no. Drag me down.
UNK: Forget it. We're so proud of how well you're doing.
UNK: I won't let you blow it. If I catch you, you're fired.
Kim : Go on, get out of here. I don't want you breathing this stuff.
UNK: So, okay. You'll come with me on the Paris trip?
Rachel : Oh, man!
Phoebe : Check it out. Cup hat, cup banner...
Phoebe : ...cup chandelier, and the thing that started it all : the cup!
