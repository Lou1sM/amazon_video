UNK: I'm just really, really trying to cut back, you know.
Rachel : Good luck, Rach.
UNK: I've been thinking about quitting.
Kim : Every Sunday night, I tell myself I'm quitting.
UNK: Every Monday morning, it's like :
Nancy : Tell me about it.
Rachel : We'll just quit. Let's all quit!
UNK: It sounds appealing.
Nancy : -I never could do it. -But you could. Absolutely.
Rachel : We can help each other. We could get those patches.
Rachel : We could be like the Patch Sisters.
UNK: You know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Rachel : Great! Give me those cigs. Come on!
UNK: Give it! Out. Done. Quit.
Kim : My late husband gave me that lighter.
Monica : I'm not kidding.
Rachel : Okay, then.
UNK: Mmm...soup.
UNK: Mmm...soup.
