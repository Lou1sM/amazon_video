UNK: Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking. How do you do this?
Joey : Fortunately, I don't get many callbacks, so...
Carol : Is it a good sign that they asked us to wait?
UNK: [scene : Who knows?
UNK: The Casting Director : We have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...
Ross : ...and Joey. The rest of you, thank you.
Ross : Yes! I knew it!
UNK: Bye-bye.
Ross : So long.
UNK: Later.
UNK: I'm not married to him anymore. He's my ex-husband. I'm totally gay!
Joey : This is great! I might get to play Ben's dad.
UNK: The Casting Director : Actually, that can't happen.
UNK: Because you have such different looks...
UNK: The Casting Director : ...we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
UNK: So it'll either be you two or you two.
UNK: -This is gonna be kind of weird. -Yeah, it is.
Kyle : Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
UNK: No. We're like best friends. That's why it's weird.
Kyle : I thought we were just talking.
UNK: If Ben gets this commercial, do you think you can get me some free soup?
UNK: Chandler, a can of soup is like 60 cents.
UNK: Yeah, okay, but I have been supporting a 29-year-old Italian for five years.
UNK: Is it okay if I leave this here till Rachel's birthday party?
UNK: -Sure. What's in them? -Cups.
Chandler : Good, because we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Ross : That's a lot of cups.
UNK: I'm in charge of cups and ice.
UNK: And Monica's gonna rue the day she put me in charge of cups and ice.
UNK: You know, I rued the day once. Didn't get a whole lot else done.
Phoebe : Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.
UNK: Ross, I'm glad you're here.
UNK: -I want to talk to you. -What's up?
Joey : I've been thinking about this commercial thing. Me against Ben.
Joey : The two of us competing. That can't lead to anything good.
Joey : I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'll tell them that I won't audition.
UNK: Joey, that's great. Thanks, man.
Joey : That's it?
Joey : You're gonna let me do this? It's my career we're talking about!
UNK: But you just
Joey : I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it.
Joey : If anyone should step aside, it should be Ben.
UNK: -What? -Chandler, tell him!
UNK: Well, let me get the door first.
Chandler : Hi, no one!
Ross : Why should Ben step aside?
Ross : It was his audition in the first place. You tagged along.
Ross : You're like the tagalong dad!
Joey : At least I care about his feelings.
UNK: What?
UNK: You know how hard it'll be on him when he doesn't get it?
Ross : And why wouldn't he get it?
Joey : Come on!
Joey : Have you seen what my kid can do?
Joey : He dials phones, he eats tortilla chips.
Joey : He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Ross : Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Joey : You just give him a spoon, baby.
UNK: Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see!
Joey : This commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
UNK: -Your kid's name is Raymond! -Yeah? So is yours!
Monica : -How did work go? -It was great.
UNK: I went down there like you said. And we talked business.
UNK: And Kim took my opinions.
Monica : You stink!
UNK: -Thanks. -No, I'm serious.
UNK: That's because I went down there and they were smoking.
Rachel : This is actually the smell of success.
UNK: But there's something different
Chandler : Oh, my God! You smoked!
