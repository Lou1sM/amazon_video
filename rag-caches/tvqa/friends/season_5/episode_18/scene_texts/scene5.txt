Rachel : I did not.
Chandler : Yes, you did. You look happy and sick. You smoked!
Rachel : All right, fine! But I had to. I had to do it for my career.
UNK: I wish I had to smoke for my career.
UNK: But it's so gross!
UNK: It's not that bad, you know?
Rachel : Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell.
UNK: I actually feel like I could throw up.
UNK: -Can you hear yourself? -I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
UNK: I'm not myself. I smoked like half a pack.
UNK: I feel a little shaky and a little weird.
UNK: But you gotta push past this, okay? Because it's about to get so good.
UNK: You smell so smoky, I gotta get up.
Monica : I'm not kidding.
Chandler : I think you smell great.
Kim : So we're decided. No on plaid, yes on pink.
UNK: Absolutely.
