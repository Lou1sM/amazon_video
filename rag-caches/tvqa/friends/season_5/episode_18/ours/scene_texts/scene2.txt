Kim : So it's down to these two. Nancy, I know you like this one.
Kim : I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
UNK: Well, that one is pretty...
UNK: ...but I just love this fabric.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Don't be. Part of your job is to give your opinions.
Kim : Then I take credit for them. I'm kidding!
Nancy : She is kidding. But don't ever disagree with her again.
Nancy : Okay, now I'm kidding!
Rachel : What a fun office.
Kim : I don't know which one. But I do know I need a cigarette.
UNK: Let's take a break, go outside and sort this out when we return.
Kim : -You smoke? -No.
Rachel : My dad's a doctor. And he would always tell me horror stories...
Rachel : About ghosts and goblins...
Rachel : ...who totally supported the princess' right to smoke.
Rachel : And then they came back from smoking and they'd made all of the decisions.
UNK: -That's not fair. -I know.
Rachel : It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisonous habit.
Chandler : Yeah, it is the best.
Rachel : What if this keeps happening?
UNK: They'll be smoking, making the decisions...
UNK: ...and I'll be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air.
UNK: And when Kim wants to promote one of us...
UNK: ...who do you think she'll pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
UNK: We used to have a smoking area at work.
UNK: It was great. There was this big flowerpot with dirt in it.
UNK: We used to put our cigarettes out in it.
UNK: One of the old-timers told me there used to be a little tree in there.
UNK: You can go down there and not smoke. Say you want some fresh air.
UNK: I could do that.
UNK: Or you could do the easy thing and smoke.
UNK: You gotta take long, deep drags.
UNK: Wow, I still don't have my lung capacity back yet.
UNK: Rach, do you wanna go get coffee?
Monica : -I would love to. -Oh, good.
UNK: I'm gonna go too.
Phoebe : Oh, good.
UNK: Oh, I changed my mind.
Phoebe : Let's talk about the party. I have so many ideas.
Monica : Me too!
Phoebe : Oh, look at that.
UNK: This is a little sketch of the cake. See?
Monica : Some sample menus.
UNK: I thought we'd start with a Tuscan-style finger food.
Monica : And for music, here's an alphabetized list of all of my CDs.
Monica : I've highlighted the ones that'll go with the food.
UNK: -What about the intimate dinner party? -We're not doing that.
Phoebe : Looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.
UNK: Wait a minute. There's plenty of things for you to do.
Phoebe : Like what?
UNK: Cups.
Phoebe : You're giving me cups?
Monica : And ice.
UNK: Cups and ice? I get to be in charge of cups and ice?
Joey : All right.
UNK: Fine. I will be in charge of cups and ice.
Monica : -I can get ice at the restaurant -I got it!
UNK: -How did the audition go? -Not so good.
Monica : Wait a minute. Are you doing Joey's :
UNK: "The audition didn't go so well... Yeah, it did"?
Ross : Yeah, I am!
Ross : -Yeah, Ben got a second audition. -That's great!
Joey : I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Monica : You got a callback too, didn't you?
Joey : Yeah, I did!
