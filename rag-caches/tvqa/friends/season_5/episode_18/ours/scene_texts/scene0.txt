Joey : Pick a card.
Joey : All right. Now, memorize it.
Joey : -You got it? -Oh, yes.
Joey : Is that your card?
UNK: Yes.
Carol : -Hey, guys. -Hi there!
Carol : Guess what. Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.
Phoebe : What are you talking about?
Ross : It's not for sure, but...
Ross : ...we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was cute.
UNK: You know, which he is. He gave us his card...
Ross : ...and told us to bring him for this commercial he's auditioning.
UNK: This guy's the biggest commercial casting director in town!
Joey : Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition?
Joey : I mean, way to go, Ben!
Joey : I've been in that park a million times and no one's offered me an audition.
UNK: It's crazy. We were pushing Ben on the swings
Joey : I'm always on the swings!
Joey : What am I doing wrong?
UNK: That.
UNK: The One Where Rachel Smokes
Rachel : -Gotta go. Wish me luck. -Good luck.
UNK: Since you work at Ralph Lauren, can you get me some shirts?
UNK: I don't know if I'd feel comfortable stealing on my very first day.
Chandler : Unwilling to steal from work.
UNK: Interesting.
UNK: If anybody gets free stuff, it's me.
Rachel : Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.
All : Go get 'em!
Phoebe : Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.
Phoebe : I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
UNK: But her birthday's not for another month.
UNK: If we throw her party on her birthday, it's not a surprise.
UNK: Great! We can have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Joey : Ross! We're having a surprise party for Rachel.
UNK: Done.
UNK: Great. Wanna do it together?
Monica : I'd love to do it together!
Joey : They're gonna do it together.
Chandler : That's my girlfriend.
Joey : So I gotta shut it down now?
UNK: I gotta go. I'm picking up Ben...
UNK: ...and then we're off to the big audition.
UNK: It's gonna be weird seeing some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
UNK: Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?
Joey : Dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Ross : Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
UNK: Maybe I'll go with you and audition as the dad.
Joey : Who better to play Ben's father than his godfather?
Ross : -You're not his godfather. -What?
Joey : Are you kidding?
Ross : Of course I am.
Ross : -Okay, let's go, godfather. -All right!
Joey : They're gonna let me audition!
Ross : Really? That's great!
Joey : One of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play.
Joey : So I steered clear of her.
UNK: And the other one, I know from...
UNK: Well, you know.
Carol : -That kid looks familiar. -Oh, yeah.
Joey : He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...
Joey : ...and that one for the phone company.
UNK: He was so good, he convinced me to switch phone companies.
Joey : Chandler was mad.
Ross : He's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid.
Ross : I mean, look at him.
