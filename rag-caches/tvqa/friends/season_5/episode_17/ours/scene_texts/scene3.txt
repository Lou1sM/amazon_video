UNK: Damn it! Did you move?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: I lived with you for a while. Then I found this place.
Ross : I'm Ross.
Joey : Do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
UNK: The Old Man : No, I'm all alone.
Joey : Yeah. Sorry about that.
Joey : Hey, little girl.
Joey : Is your mommy or sister or babysitter, by any chance, a hot girl?
UNK: -Daddy! -Later, girl!
Joey : Oh, man!
Joey : Hot girl?
Joey : Hot girl!
UNK: Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
UNK: -It's nice to see you again. -Thank you.
UNK: What?
Rachel : -Excuse me? -Yeah, let me
UNK: Okay, I see what's going on here. Now, look...
Rachel : ...I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
Rachel : But I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead.
Rachel : Even though I kissed you, that does not give you...
Rachel : ...the right to demand sex from me! I do not want this job that bad.
Rachel : Good day, sir.
UNK: If you're going in there to see Mr. Zelner, I hope you're ready to put out.
Monica : I am.
UNK: You are not gonna believe...
Rachel : ...what that sleazeball from Ralph Lauren did to me!
UNK: Okay, that's amazing! How did you know that?
Ross : You got ink on your lip.
Chandler : What do you say, maybe, sometime I hold your gun?
UNK: We're not supposed to do that.
UNK: What could happen? I mean
Gary : Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
UNK: -Do you want to see a movie tonight? -We can't. We already have plans.
Monica : What are you doing?
Phoebe : Well, same thing we did all day. Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
Phoebe : He is so amazing. We never left the bedroom.
Phoebe : But have fun at the movie.
UNK: Well, we're not seeing a movie.
Phoebe : Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Monica : Because I just wanted to know what you were doing...
UNK: ...so you wouldn't walk in on me and Chandler...
UNK: ...while we were doing it all night.
Monica : Will you excuse me?
UNK: Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Monica : -We have got to beat them! -Why?
