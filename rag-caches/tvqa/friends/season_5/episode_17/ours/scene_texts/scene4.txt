UNK: Because Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than us.
UNK: So?
UNK: So we've gotta go have a lot of sex and prove them wrong!
UNK: You've got to stop this competitive thing. It's crazy.
UNK: Just to impress them, you want us to have sex over and over...
Chandler : ...and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat!
Rachel : Excuse me.
UNK: The Man : You should check this out. Tell the other tenants.
UNK: Apparently, he's looking for some kind of hot girl.
Ross : Who isn't?
UNK: I don't think we've met. I'm Ross.
UNK: The Hot Girl : I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
UNK: Never mind.
UNK: The Hot Girl : I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.
UNK: The Hot Girl : I mean, you had just moved in.
Ross : I had just moved in!
Rachel : Thank you!
UNK: Listen...
UNK: Jen.
Ross : I know this may sound a little...
UNK: But would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?
Jen : Sure, that would be nice.
UNK: My number's on there. Give me a call.
Ross : I will give you a call.
Jen : -I'll see you later. -Okay.
Jen : I forgot my paper.
Chandler : That was amazing.
Monica : Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Chandler : That was amazing.
Monica : We are the hottest, huh?
Monica : No one is hotter than we are.
UNK: -We're the best. -No, you're the best.
Chandler : -No, you're the best. -No, you're the best.
Monica : I am the best.
Joey : Hey, guys.
UNK: What you been doing?
UNK: Isn't that the girl who waved at you?
Joey : I don't know, but I can see through your sheet.
Joey : Yeah, that's her.
UNK: You know, it doesn't matter. I'll never meet her.
Joey : It's impossible to find her apartment!
UNK: She lives in some hot-girl parallel universe or something.
Monica : What are you talking about?
UNK: She lives on the 2nd floor, 7th apartment from the left.
UNK: No, she lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left.
Monica : No. Those first two windows, that's the lobby.
UNK: That other window is the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Joey : I did not know that! Thank you, Monica.
Joey : I almost lost another girl because of counting!
UNK: -So you ready? -Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
Jen : -Could you get that? -Sure.
Rachel : No! No!
UNK: First, I would like to say thank you for seeing me again.
UNK: That's all right.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : But I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
