Rachel : -Good! You guys are all here. -What's up?
Rachel : I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.
UNK: Congratulations!
UNK: Oh, boy. That guy's underwear sucks!
UNK: -What? -Well, I got this pair marked "XS."
UNK: Let me tell you, there was no room for excess anything in there.
UNK: I'll be the coordinator of the women's collection.
Rachel : I'll work right under the director. It's the perfect job for me!
Phoebe : If you nail the interview, you'll get it.
UNK: You want to work on your interview skills?
Phoebe : Let's start with the handshake.
Phoebe : Very good handshake. Good wrist action.
Monica : Let me try.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! What did I ever do to you?
UNK: Did I squeeze too hard?
Phoebe : Let's just say I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
UNK: The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss
Joey : That's right, Ross. I can see you in your new apartment.
Joey : Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Monica : Is he doing his "shark attack" bit?
UNK: No. Oh, wait! There he goes.
Joey : Very funny, Ross.
Joey : Very lifelike and funny.
Rachel : No, no. I wasn't waving at you, lady.
Joey : Whoa, maybe I was.
UNK: This hot girl in Ross' building is flirting with me.
Monica : Get in there, man. Flirt back. Mix it up!
UNK: Yeah, I'm down with that.
Joey : Okay, here goes.
UNK: How...
UNK: ...you...
UNK: ...doing?
Joey : It worked! She's waving me over. I'll be right over.
Joey : Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Monica : -She is pretty, huh? -Tell me about it.
UNK: No, no! I'm not with her.
UNK: That's just Monica.
Ross : Hey, Joey!
Ross : Great stuff, huh?
UNK: This your place?
UNK: Yeah, of course it is. Come on in.
Ross : Go by the window. You can pretend to be surfing.
Joey : I counted. You're not supposed to live here!
Joey : Oh, man!
Monica : What happened?
UNK: I ended up at Ross' place. I must have miscounted or something.
Joey : Damn! She's not there anymore.
Joey : Look, Ross is doing his "watching TV" bit.
UNK: No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.
UNK: Gary's Radio : We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
UNK: Okay, now I really have to go.
UNK: It's so unfair that our date has to get cut short...
UNK: ...just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
Gary : -I know, but it's my job. -Then maybe I could come too.
UNK: Gary's Radio : Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Phoebe : All right, you go.
Phoebe : -Oh, God! -What?
Phoebe : Oh, I just miss him so much!
Monica : For just a week, you guys are close.
Phoebe : Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it. He's so sweet.
Phoebe : He's like this little puppy dog, you know?
