Rachel : Well, first, I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you...
Rachel : ...and for yelling at you.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Fair enough.
Rachel : Now, you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not...
Rachel : ...yell at you and storm out.
Rachel : And I think that's a big mistake. And here's why.
Rachel : I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back. That shows courage.
Rachel : When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no.
Rachel : That shows integrity.
Rachel : And I was not afraid to stand up for myself...
Rachel : ...and that shows courage.
UNK: Now, I know that I've already said courage...
UNK: ...but you've got to have courage.
Rachel : And finally, when I thought you were making sexual advances...
Rachel : ...I said no, and I was not litigious.
Rachel : So there you go! You got courage...
Rachel : ...you got integrity, you got courage again...
Rachel : ...and not litigious.
Rachel : Look, Mr...
UNK: Zelner.
Rachel : I knew that!
UNK: Oh, I knew that.
Rachel : I really, really want this job.
UNK: And I think I would be really good at it.
Monica : You know what?
UNK: Mr. Zelner : I may regret this...
UNK: ...but I'll give you a shot.
UNK: You are? Really?
UNK: Thank you. Oh, God!
UNK: Would it be inappropriate if I gave you a hug?
UNK: Well, how about a handshake?
Rachel : Oh, God! I'm sorry!
Rachel : I did not mean to touch that! I mean, you!
UNK: There!
UNK: I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much.
