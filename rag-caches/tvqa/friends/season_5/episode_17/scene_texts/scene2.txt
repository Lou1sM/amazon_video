Phoebe : I was wrong, obviously. I just misspoke. It's okay.
Monica : It is okay.
UNK: As long as you know Chandler and I are also hot and fiery.
Monica : Just as hot as you.
Monica : I mean, our flame...
UNK: It is on fire!
Chandler : Here's your broom back.
Monica : You are so cute!
UNK: The cute bar keeps getting lower and lower, doesn't it?
Chandler : How'd the interview go?
Rachel : Horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing.
UNK: Did you say you wanted to have sex with his wife then fall off your chair?
UNK: Did you get drunk on the way over there?
UNK: Well, that explains why you didn't do the other stuff.
Chandler : So, what happened?
Rachel : It was horrible! And the interview part went so well.
Rachel : I even made him laugh.
Rachel : He said something about a boat...
Rachel : ...and I was like, "Well, yeah, if you've got enough life jackets."
Rachel : Trust me. It was actually very funny.
UNK: Anyway, we were saying goodbye and...
Monica : What happened?
Rachel : We were shaking hands...
UNK: ...and he leaned in toward me.
UNK: Maybe he was opening the door...
Rachel : ...but I totally misread him and I...
Joey : You kissed him?
Rachel : I didn't know what else to do!
UNK: You could have tried...
Chandler : ...not kissing him.
Rachel : Thanks, Chandler.
Monica : A guy from Ralph Lauren called. You got a second interview.
UNK: Monica, that's not funny.
UNK: Oh, okay.
Monica : A guy from Ralph Lauren called You got a second interview
UNK: Oh, my God, Monica, you better be serious.
UNK: You just told me to be funny!
UNK: Oh, my God. I can't believe it! I got a second interview.
Joey : That kiss isn't looking like such a mistake now, is it?
Rachel : You don't think that's why he wants me back?
UNK: Yeah!
UNK: No?
Monica : What are you talking about?
Rachel : I accidentally kissed him in the interview...
Rachel : ...and now he wants me back...
UNK: ...because, "Let's bring back the girl who kisses everybody!"
Chandler : Come on, Rach.
Rachel : What if he thinks I'll just sleep with him?
UNK: He wants you back because you're right for the job.
UNK: Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God! How could I be so stupid?
UNK: Rachel, don't say that. I think you just need a hug from Joey.
Joey : Come on. Come on.
Joey : She's back! Hot girl's back!
Rachel : Well, I'm not totally back yet, but I appreciate it.
UNK: No. In Ross' building. She's back!
Joey : Wait there. I'll be over in a second.
UNK: One, two, three... Got it!
Chandler : I gotta check out this hot girl.
Chandler : There she is!
