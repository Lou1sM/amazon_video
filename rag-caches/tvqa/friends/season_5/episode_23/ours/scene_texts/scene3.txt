Phoebe : Hey, you guys, wait! You guys.
UNK: This place is much better than London.
UNK: A lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me this.
UNK: Ninety-nine cent steak and lobster dinner.
Monica : You don't eat animals.
UNK: For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
Phoebe : I can totally settle down here.
Phoebe : It's got everything I could ever want. Including Joey! Look!
UNK: Look! Hey!
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
Chandler : Love your condoms, my man.
UNK: Why are you here? I told you not to come.
Phoebe : Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Joey : Because I'm shooting a scene right now. I play a gladiator.
UNK: Hold on a second. Can we cut?
Joey : My friends are here. I'm gonna take a break.
Monica : Who are you talking to?
UNK: The director.
UNK: Her.
Joey : All right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Chandler : Why? What happened?
UNK: The movie shut down. Ran out of money.
UNK: I'm working here till it starts up, if it ever does.
Monica : -I'm so sorry. -Such a drag.
UNK: Sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry.
Chandler : Apparently there's a new policy of not sharing.
UNK: -I knew you weren't okay with that. -So you're a gladiator!
Joey : What's going on?
Phoebe : -Monica had lunch with Richard. -Dawson?
Phoebe : But that would've been so cool!
Chandler : Her boyfriend Richard.
UNK: It meant nothing. After all this time, how can you not trust me?
UNK: When you go lunching with hunky men and don't tell me!
Rachel : You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
UNK: Thanks.
Joey : -There we go. -Now I love Vegas.
Monica : I promise you next time I absolutely will tell you.
UNK: -"Next time"? -So close.
UNK: There won't be a next time. You cannot see him again.
UNK: I cannot see him? You can't tell me what to do.
UNK: That's funny, I think I just did.
UNK: If you act like this, I won't be around you.
UNK: -Fine. -Happy anniversary!
Joey : Guys, please! Come on, come on.
Joey : This is obviously a misunderstanding.
Monica : No, it is not.
Joey : Don't look at me. I just work here.
UNK: Okay, Ross? I'm a little warm, so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.
Rachel : Now, I'm just letting you know...
Rachel : ...this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Ross : Yep, that's hilarious.
Rachel : I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
UNK: You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
UNK: No, not really. You've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Ross : But it was a first for the rest of my building.
UNK: That's true. But I just don't embarrass that easily.
Ross : What? You totally get embarrassed.
Rachel : No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Ross : -Is that so? -Yeah.
Ross : Hey, lady!
Ross : I don't care how much you want it, okay?
UNK: I am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!
UNK: You know, in Roman times, this was more than just a hat.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah, sure, sure.
Joey : They would scrub the floors.
Joey : They'd use it to get the mud off their shoe.
Joey : Sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.
Joey : So they would stick it right
Chandler : I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Joey : I'll take you someplace nice. A guy tipped me $100.
Joey : He was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.
Joey : Can you believe that?
Chandler : If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.
Chandler : Build up my upper body...
Chandler : ...and hit Richard from behind with a stick.
