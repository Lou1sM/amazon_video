UNK: So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
UNK: So far, it's pretty much the same, Phoebe.
Phoebe : What about after I give you these candies?
Chandler : I guess it's a little better now.
Phoebe : Las Vegas, 1. London, 0.
UNK: I'll be back.
Chandler : Happy Plane-aversary.
Monica : I love you.
UNK: -Can I give you your present now? -Okay!
UNK: Oh, don't tell me I did this.
UNK: I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!
UNK: How about "I did forget the present, forgive me" not fake-out?
Monica : You can give it to me when we get back.
UNK: This is the worst thing that could happen.
Phoebe : You decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
UNK: What "Richard thing"?
Rachel : Oh, no.
UNK: What "Richard thing"?
Phoebe : Simmons. Go with Simmons.
Monica : I ran into Richard yesterday.
Monica : He asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
Monica : I didn't tell you because you'd get mad...
UNK: ...and I didn't wanna spoil our anniversary.
Chandler : I'm not mad.
UNK: Really?
UNK: So you bumped into Richard. You grabbed a "bite."
Chandler : No big deal.
UNK: Great.
Phoebe : Okay, London, 1.
UNK: This is gonna be a real horserace.
Rachel : Oh, look what happened.
Rachel : Check me out.
Rachel : I'm in my kitchen...
UNK: ...naked.
Rachel : I'm picking up an orange.
Rachel : I'm naked.
UNK: I'm lighting the candles.
Rachel : Naked. And carefully.
Ross : Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!
Ross : I can't look at that. I am looking at this.
Ross : Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.
Ross : Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
Ross : She knows I'm home.
Ross : She knows I can see her.
Ross : What kind of game is she playing?
Ross : I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
Ross : Dr. Geller.
Ross : Stop it. You're being silly.
Ross : Or am I?
UNK: Love to love you baby
UNK: Love to love you baby
UNK: Love to love you baby
UNK: Darn it!
Ross : May I come in?
Rachel : Yeah, if you want to.
Ross : Do you want me to?
Rachel : Yeah, sure?
Ross : So do I.
Ross : Okay, Rach, before anything happens...
UNK: ...I wanna lay down a couple of ground rules.
Ross : This is just about tonight.
UNK: I won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us."
Ross : I just want this to be...
Ross : ...about what it is.
UNK: And...
Rachel : ...what is that, Ross?
Ross : The physical act of love.
Rachel : What, are you crazy?
Ross : So you weren't trying to entice me just now with your nakedness?
Rachel : Oh, God. You saw me?
Ross : You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness?
Rachel : You actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?
UNK: Oh, wow. I'm sorry. But, Ross, you kicked off your shoes.
Ross : -Can we just forget this ever happened? -Of course. You're right. I'm sorry.
Ross : -Thank you. -Yes.
Ross : -I guess I'm gonna go pack. -Okay. Wait, one more thing.
Rachel : Do we still need to settle the question of "us"?
