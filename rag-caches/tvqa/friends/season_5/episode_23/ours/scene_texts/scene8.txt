Joey : That's right.
UNK: -Thirteen. -Hit me!
Chandler : Oh, man!
UNK: Wait!
Joey : You are not gonna believe this!
Joey : I have found my identical hand twin.
UNK: What?
Joey : My identical hand twin!
Chandler : What's an identical hand twin?
UNK: What does it sound like?
Joey : It's a guy with my identical hands.
UNK: It was incredible. The dealer's hands were exactly like mine.
Joey : It was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Chandler : You sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
UNK: Don't you see what this means? I can forget about that stupid movie.
Joey : I'm gonna be a millionaire!
UNK: -How? -I don't have it all worked out yet.
Joey : But it's gotta mean big money. Come on, identical hands!
Chandler : Again, I must go back to...
UNK: ...how?
Joey : This is Vegas, man. People will pay to see freaky stuff!
Joey : How much would you pay to see this hand...
UNK: ...twice?
Chandler : I can't really put a price on that.
Joey : Are you un-supporting me again?
Chandler : I support you 100%. I just didn't get it right away.
Chandler : Now I'm caught up.
Chandler : Identical hand twins.
Chandler : It's a million-dollar idea!
UNK: Right? I know. Okay. All right.
UNK: What's that for?
UNK: Well, I gotta document this before that dealer gets off his break.
Joey : I found my identical hand twin!
UNK: Oh, you're so lucky!
Phoebe : So where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Phoebe : But she just came up here.
Chandler : That was Joey.
Phoebe : I wonder where she is? It's so weird.
Chandler : She's probably talking to Richard.
Phoebe : Would you stop that?
UNK: You know what she said after her lunch with Richard?
Phoebe : She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you.
UNK: -Really? -Yes.
Phoebe : She feels terrible. She really wants to make up. You've gotta find her.
UNK: Good.
Phoebe : I should really start wearing hats.
UNK: The Flight Attendant : Welcome to Las Vegas.
UNK: -Did you enjoy your flight? -I did.
Rachel : Thank you very much. It was excellent.
UNK: -I hope you had a nice flight. -Oh, it was the best.
