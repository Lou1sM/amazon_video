Phoebe : Oh, well, lost again.
Phoebe : That's it. You and me. Outside!
UNK: I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
Phoebe : Be cool.
UNK: Okay, your lurking days are over.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Everyone you lurk, I'll lurk first.
Phoebe : You move on, I'll be one step ahead of you...
Phoebe : ...every single time.
Phoebe : And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day...
UNK: ...till Monday...
Phoebe : ...because that's when I go home.
Phoebe : When do you leave?
UNK: The Lurker : Also Monday.
Phoebe : What time? Maybe we can share a cab.
Joey : Hit me.
Joey : Hit me.
Ross : We need more cards.
UNK: Yeah. And we also need more drinks. Hold on a second.
Rachel : Hello, Vegas?
UNK: We would like more alcohol.
UNK: You know what else? We would like some more beers.
UNK: Oh, I forgot to dial.
Ross : That must be our alcohol and beers.
Ross : It's Joey! I love Joey!
UNK: Oh, I love Joey!
Rachel : Joey lives with a duck.
UNK: Look, I need some help, okay?
UNK: Someone has to convince my hand twin to cooperate.
UNK: I'll do it. Whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.
Ross : Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah. Fine. Thanks.
Joey : Hey, Rach?
UNK: How you doing?
UNK: I'm doing good, baby. How you doing?
Joey : Don't let her drink anymore.
Ross : Here's that macadamia nut.
UNK: No, something else.
UNK: So, what do you wanna do now?
Ross : I wanna get out of the room.
Ross : I really miss downstairs.
UNK: Okay, you know what? There is only one way I am leaving this hotel room.
Ross : Well, hello!
Ross : I'm Ross.
UNK: -Good luck to you. -Sir, you've got a little something...
UNK: Hello.
Chandler : I won!
Phoebe : I won! I finally won!
UNK: The Lurker : I won! That was my quarter!
Phoebe : Take a hike, toots.
Ross : Excuse me, sir.
UNK: The Lurker : This lady played my quarter. This is my money.
UNK: The Security Guard : Is that true, miss?
Phoebe : Sells drugs to kids.
