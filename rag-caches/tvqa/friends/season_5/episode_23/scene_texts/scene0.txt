UNK: -Phoebe, could you get that, please? -Why?
UNK: Just because you're too lazy to get up off your tushy?
UNK: No, it's just that all the people in the world I would want to talk to are right here.
UNK: Sucker.
UNK: Hello?
Phoebe : -Hey, Joey! -Hey, Phoebe.
UNK: I need a favor.
UNK: I forgot the PIN to my ATM card. Can you get it for me?
Phoebe : Sure. Where is it?
Joey : I scratched it on the ATM machine on the corner.
Phoebe : So you're 5-6-3-9?
Joey : That's it! Thanks.
UNK: -Wanna talk to Chandler? -Let me talk to him.
Joey : He didn't believe in my movie...
Joey : ...which is a big mistake, because it is real. Real.
UNK: A Casino Boss : Tribbiani, get back to work. Break time's over.
Phoebe : -Who was that? -My stunt double. Yeah.
Joey : He's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
UNK: I've tried to apologize.
UNK: If I can't do it on the phone, I'll go and do it in person.
Joey : I heard that. Can you put him on?
Joey : Don't come out here.
UNK: I support you 100% and I wanna prove that to you in person.
UNK: I got that. I forgive you. Don't come out here.
UNK: You haven't taken my calls for a week.
UNK: I'm totally over it. Friends forever. Don't come out here.
UNK: A Tourist : Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Chandler : -What was that? -Entertainment Tonight.
UNK: Good talking to you and don't come out here.
UNK: The One in Vegas
Phoebe : Monica? I'm sorry I'm late.
Monica : I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Monica : That's okay.
Phoebe : What the hell took you so long?
UNK: You can't tell Chandler. I ran into Richard.
Phoebe : -Which Richard? -The Richard.
Phoebe : Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!
UNK: No, my ex-boyfriend Richard. You know, the tall guy, mustache.
Phoebe : Okay, that actually makes more sense. How was it?
UNK: It was really nice. We talked and I had lunch with him.
UNK: That's weird. I dreamed you had lunch with Richard.
UNK: -Really? -Again, Richard Simmons.
Phoebe : Go on.
Monica : The strange part was he was really nice...
Monica : ...and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything.
UNK: So why can't we tell Chandler?
UNK: It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.
Phoebe : I can't believe you guys have lasted a whole year!
Phoebe : Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.
Phoebe : On a totally different bet.
