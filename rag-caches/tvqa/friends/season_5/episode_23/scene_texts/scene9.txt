UNK: I think the check-in is that way.
Rachel : Kids love me.
UNK: Hi, you guys are here!
UNK: What'd you do? Did you go to a costume party?
Phoebe : Let me guess. Pancho Villa.
Phoebe : And you're Bob Saget.
UNK: Pancho Villa?
UNK: What are you talking about, Phoebe? I don't
Rachel : Oh, my God! You drew on me?
Ross : Hey, you wet my pants!
Phoebe : What kind of party was this?
UNK: I've been walking around like this? You have so crossed a line.
Ross : Rach, wait. The men's room is that way.
UNK: It's the third time she's won on a machine I was playing.
UNK: I bet she's one of those people.
Phoebe : Mole people?
UNK: What? No, a lurker.
UNK: What's that?
Ross : When you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out...
Ross : ...a lurker waits for you to give up and then
Phoebe : Kills you?
Ross : They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Phoebe : -How do you know about this? -My nana used to do it.
UNK: That's how she paid for my dance Karate lessons.
Phoebe : Dance karate?
Ross : Yes, it's a deadly...
Ross : ...but beautiful sport.
Rachel : -It won't come off. -What?
Rachel : It won't come off.
UNK: Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?
Rachel : I took it off and then I drew it back on.
UNK: Rach, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sure we can get it off, okay?
UNK: -Just give me your pen. -Why? What are you gonna do?
UNK: Well, I believe I'm going to stab you repeatedly.
UNK: Not here. There are cameras everywhere.
Joey : You made it!
Joey : Who's your friend? He's hot.
Ross : Thanks, man.
Ross : Listen, I talked to Chandler. And I'm sorry about the movie.
Joey : Don't be sorry.
Joey : I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin.
Ross : Your what?
Joey : My identical hand twin. The person whose hands are like mine.
UNK: -Were you looking for this person? -Not even. This thing is a gold mine.
UNK: What?
UNK: That won't make you any money.
UNK: Well, fine.
UNK: None of you will live with me in my hand-shaped mansion.
Joey : Except you. You can live in the thumb.
Monica : All right, baby, come on!
Monica : I am on fire!
Chandler : See you later.
Monica : What are you doing?
UNK: What's it look like? Going home.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Wait. Sorry, I was just playing for one second.
Monica : If you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't.
Monica : He means nothing to me.
UNK: Oh, come on. I was there.
Chandler : I know he's the love of your life.
UNK: Not anymore.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Really.
