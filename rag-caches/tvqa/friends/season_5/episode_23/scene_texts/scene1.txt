Monica : -It's almost our anniversary! -I know.
Chandler : One year ago today, I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Phoebe : Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
UNK: I got you a gift.
UNK: -It's not till tomorrow. -I know, but you have to open it today.
Monica : Okay! There you go!
Monica : It's two tickets to Vegas!
UNK: Yeah! For this weekend! It'll be perfect.
UNK: You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start our celebration on the plane.
UNK: We can call it our "Plane-aversary."
Chandler : Do we have to?
UNK: This is great, but Joey didn't want any of us there.
UNK: He doesn't want us to go to any trouble. He'll be excited when we surprise him.
Monica : Plus, we get to have our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!
UNK: "Anna-vada-versary!"
Chandler : I think we should see other people.
Monica : We can go, right?
Chandler : Great idea.
Phoebe : I'm gonna go too!
UNK: Phoebe, it's kind of our anniversary.
UNK: You won't ditch me like you did with London.
Monica : Ditch you? You were pregnant
Phoebe : Great story. I'm going.
Phoebe : Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
Phoebe : Including me!
UNK: Do you wanna go?
UNK: I can take a couple days off work.
Phoebe : Of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!
Rachel : I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Ross : I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit. I waited a year for this.
Chandler : Art lover.
Ross : What'd you say?
Chandler : I said, art lover.
UNK: -Was that supposed to be an insult? -I don't know, I'm very tired.
UNK: -Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday? -Sounds great.
Ross : I'll call the airlines.
UNK: That'll be nice to have the apartment to myself.
UNK: To walk around naked.
Rachel : No, so I can be by myself. Have a little alone time.
Phoebe : Naked alone time.
UNK: Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
Rachel : You live alone, you don't walk around naked.
UNK: Why does it takes me so long to answer the door?
