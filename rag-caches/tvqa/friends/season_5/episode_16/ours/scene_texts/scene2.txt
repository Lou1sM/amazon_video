Rachel : We still need a tip.
Phoebe : All right. Hold on.
Phoebe : I got it.
UNK: Nickel.
UNK: -How much do we need? -Couple of bucks.
Phoebe : Okay, dime.
UNK: You guys keep talking. This could take a while.
Phoebe : Wait, look it!
Phoebe : This is a police badge!
UNK: Cool. But why would a cop come in here? They don't serve doughnuts.
Chandler : Could you discover the badge again? I can do better than that.
Rachel : I bet somebody's missing that badge.
UNK: I should take it back. But at the police station...
UNK: ...I'll check their 10 Most Wanted List.
UNK: My friend's been number 11 forever. This could be her year!
Joey : -Hey, you guys. -Hey, Joey.
UNK: Is that my sweatshirt?
Monica : Yes, it is. I'm sorry. I was cold. I hope it's okay.
UNK: It's just that if you wear someone's sweatshirt...
Joey : ...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?
UNK: And I'm not him.
Monica : I'm sorry. I'll give it back.
Joey : It's gonna be all smelling like Monica.
UNK: Do I smell bad?
Joey : You smell like a meadow.
Monica : I'm sorry.
Monica : What's with him?
Chandler : The last time Joey went to a meadow his mother was shot by a hunter.
UNK: Look what I found. It's a police badge.
UNK: What's that doing here? I don't see any doughnuts.
UNK: Cops and doughnuts. Come on.
UNK: If Chandler had said it you'd all be on the floor.
UNK: Cops, doughnuts? Me?
Ross : I still don't know.
UNK: I want to make sure I bought the right couch, one that says...
Ross : ..."Kids welcome here," but that also says...
Ross : ..."Come here to me."
Rachel : What? You say that to kids?
Ross : The "Come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.
Rachel : Ross, honey, it's a nice couch, it's not a magic couch.
UNK: Well, you picked a great couch.
UNK: -Sign here, please. -Sure.
Ross : The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Rachel : That's ridiculous. He lives three blocks away.
Ross : I'll take it myself. Thank you.
UNK: All right, Rach, come on. Let's go.
UNK: Are you kidding?
Ross : Come on. It's only three blocks. It's not very heavy. Try it.
Rachel : Oh, I can do it.
UNK: You two will really enjoy that couch.
Ross : We're not together.
UNK: The Salesman : Something didn't quite add up there.
Ross : What's that supposed to mean?
UNK: The Salesman : Well, you. Her.
UNK: The Salesman : I mean, she's very...
Chandler : ...you know.
UNK: The Salesman : And you're, like...
Chandler : ...you know?
Ross : Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
UNK: The Salesman : Really? You two?
UNK: I don't want to do this now. I'm carrying a heavy couch.
Ross : Then tell him quickly.
UNK: Fine. We went out.
Ross : Not only did we go out...
Ross : ...we did it 298 times!
