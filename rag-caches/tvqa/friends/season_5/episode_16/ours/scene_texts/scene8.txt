Joey : I'll treat you real nice.
UNK: Yeah. Well, you know...
Rachel : I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date.
UNK: But the way you do it is you meet someone, become their friend...
Rachel : ...build a foundation, then ask them out on a date.
Rachel : Don't hit on your existing friends.
Joey : Won't that take longer?
Rachel : Oh, but once you find it...
Rachel : ...it's so worth the wait.
Joey : I understand.
UNK: Good.
Joey : Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.
Ross : Come here to me.
UNK: No, no. You come here to me.
Rachel : -I brought reinforcements. -Great! You brought Joey?
Rachel : The next best thing.
Ross : You brought Chandler? The next best thing would be Monica!
Chandler : I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Ross : I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.
UNK: Rach, that's you.
Ross : That's the couch.
Ross : What's that?
Ross : That's me.
Rachel : Certainly think a lot of yourself.
UNK: No. That's my arm.
Chandler : I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Ross : Just follow my lead.
Ross : Come on, Chandler.
Joey : -All right. -Okay.
Ross : Here we go.
Ross : All right. Ready?
UNK: Turn!
UNK: Turn!
UNK: Turn!
UNK: -I don't think we can turn any more! -I don't think it'll fit!
Ross : Yeah, it will. Come on! Up, up, up!
Ross : Up! Yes!
Ross : Here we go! Pivot!
UNK: Pivot!
UNK: Pivot!
UNK: Pivot!
UNK: Pivot!
UNK: Pivot!
Chandler : Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
UNK: I don't think it'll pivot any more.
Rachel : You think?
UNK: All right, let's bring it back down and try again.
Chandler : I think it's really stuck now.
Ross : -I can't believe that didn't work. -I know. Me neither.
Rachel : I mean, you had a sketch.
Chandler : What did you mean when you said "pivot"?
UNK: Man, I cannot figure this out.
UNK: Yeah, because it's not 1985.
UNK: You guys, guess what? I ditched a cop.
UNK: -What? -What do you mean?
UNK: He caught me using his badge and he tried to bust me.
UNK: Damn real cops!
UNK: How far did he chase you?
UNK: Well, he didn't really. He just picked up his badge and stood there.
UNK: Maybe we'll see you on World's Most Boring Police Chases.
UNK: -Why did you run? -I had to.
UNK: You know, impersonating a cop is like a Class E felony.
UNK: Two to four years minimum. I am not going back to that hellhole.
UNK: If I can just get it to pivot...
UNK: ...we'll be back on track.
UNK: -Rach, can I get some help please? -Yeah.
UNK: Turn it off! Turn it off!
UNK: Maybe the firemen can help us move the couch when they get here.
UNK: -Wait, wait, wait. -It's a new couch! It's a new couch!
Rachel : How's it going? Make any new friends?
UNK: Yeah. I met this woman.
Chandler : What's she like?
Joey : Well, she's...
Joey : ...really good in bed.
UNK: -You were going to be friends first. -Hey, it's all your fault.
UNK: Why?
