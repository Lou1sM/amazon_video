UNK: Could you give me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
UNK: I'd love to, but I got acting class. But you know what?
UNK: I guess I could blow that off. For you.
Joey : Let me ask you something. I was talking with Monica and Chandler.
Joey : Boy, they are really tight.
Monica : I know.
UNK: That's not a bad situation they got there.
UNK: Think I'll get me one of those.
Rachel : What's up, Joe?
Joey : I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Joey : ...because they were friends first.
UNK: So I asked myself, who are my friends? You and Phoebe.
Joey : I saw you first, so...
Rachel : -What are you saying? -Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
UNK: You know, honey...
Rachel : ...as flattered as I am...
Rachel : ...that you saw me first...
UNK: ...I just don't think we should be cranking anything up.
