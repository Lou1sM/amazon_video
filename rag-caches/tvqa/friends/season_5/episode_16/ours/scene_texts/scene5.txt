UNK: -There's just something about her. -Rach, can we concentrate?
UNK: Yeah, fine. I listened to your dumb story.
Ross : Okay, go left.
Ross : Left. Left.
UNK: Okay, you know what? There's no more left left.
Ross : Lift it straight up over your head.
UNK: Straight up. You can do it!
Ross : You can do it!
Ross : Okay. You got it?
UNK: -Go, go. -Good, good.
Ross : You got it, right? You got it, right? You got
Rachel : Any chance you think it looks good there?
UNK: This guy was all :
Phoebe : And I'm all, "Buffay! Homicide!"
Phoebe : It was just so cool!
UNK: -You were supposed to take it back. -I'm having fun doing good deeds.
UNK: You can get arrested for impersonating a police officer.
Chandler : You could get arrested right now!
UNK: I'd better take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
UNK: Yeah. I didn't know you guys would be here.
UNK: -Do me a favor. Taste this. -What? Why?
UNK: It's okay, Joe, she's a trained chef.
UNK: Actually, I was looking for Phoebe.
UNK: Well, you just missed her.
UNK: Was that her?
UNK: -I gotta go. -Joey, wait a minute. Wait.
UNK: -What is with you? -Nothing.
UNK: You're acting strange.
Joey : All right. There is something.
UNK: I kind of had a dream.
Joey : But I don't want to talk about it.
Chandler : What if Martin Luther King had said that?
UNK: I kind of have a dream.
Joey : I don't want to talk about it.
UNK: Look, it involved Monica.
UNK: You had a dream about the girl I'm seeing? Cool.
UNK: I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.
UNK: Let's talk about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
UNK: There was no sex. I haven't dreamt of her like that...
Joey : ...since I found out about you two. More or less.
Monica : What was the dream about?
Joey : You were my girlfriend. We were doing the crossword puzzle.
UNK: Like you did last night.
Joey : That's it. I'm in love with Monica. I'll move out.
UNK: Joey, come on. That doesn't mean you're in love with me.
UNK: It doesn't?
UNK: It could mean anything. Like...
UNK: ...you're jealous that I've become the apartment stud.
Joey : Sounds like your dream.
UNK: Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me being close and stuff...
UNK: ...and you want that too.
Joey : In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
UNK: If that's what it was, that'd be great. I wouldn't have to move.
Chandler : Are you attracted to Monica?
Chandler : Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Joey : -Not really. -There you have it!
Monica : Well, sure! I'm just wearing sweats!
Monica : But that's good!
Monica : You're not in love with me. You just want a girlfriend.
UNK: It's not just about getting a girlfriend.
UNK: I could get a girlfriend. We could sit and do crossword puzzles.
UNK: But could we have the closeness like you have?
Chandler : Monica and I were friends before we dated. Maybe that's it.
Joey : Friends first?
Joey : That's interesting.
Monica : -You become friends after? -No, never done that either.
UNK: Do you guys have a tape measure?
Chandler : Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.
Phoebe : That's right.
Rachel : What's up, Joey?
UNK: How you doing?
