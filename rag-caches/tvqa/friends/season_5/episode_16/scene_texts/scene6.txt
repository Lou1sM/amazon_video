Phoebe : Excuse me. Is this your car?
UNK: Don't park here. You're blocking the entrance.
Joey : Don't worry. It's not a problem.
UNK: It's a problem for me, so it's a problem for you, because I'm a cop.
Guy : So am I.
Phoebe : Okay. So you're a cop. You can park anywhere.
UNK: I know, because I'm a cop too.
Phoebe : Keep up the good work. 10-4.
UNK: Wait. So, what precinct are you with?
UNK: I'm with the 57th.
Cop : -I know a guy in Homicide up there. -I'm in Vice.
Phoebe : In fact, I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
UNK: Who else is in Vice there?
Chandler : Do you know...
UNK: ...Sipowicz?
UNK: Sipowicz? I don't think so.
UNK: Yeah. Sipowicz. Yeah. Big guy, kind of bald.
Cop : I don't know him.
UNK: Don't try to call him. He's not there. He's out.
Phoebe : His partner just died.
Cop : Tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
Phoebe : I sure will. Take care.
Cop : By the way, I'm sure Sipowicz will be all right.
Cop : I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.
UNK: Where'd you find my badge?
