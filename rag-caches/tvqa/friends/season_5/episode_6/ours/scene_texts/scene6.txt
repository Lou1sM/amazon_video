UNK: You can't even open your mind to see you might be wrong.
Rachel : What does that say about you?
UNK: That pizza place across the street any good?
Danny : I'm hungry. You want some pizza?
Danny : You can keep yelling.
Rachel : Stop saying that. I hate that.
Phoebe : Are you still mad?
UNK: Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.
UNK: You know what? I'm not in the mood.
Joey : Look, Ross.
Joey : I feel really bad. You're going through all this stuff...
Joey : ...and I just acted like a jerk.
Chandler : -We are so sorry. -You're stepping on the song.
UNK: We were way out of line, all right? We totally support you.
Monica : Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Phoebe : Now you're just taking lines out of the song.
UNK: This is hard enough, okay? I really need you guys right now.
Phoebe : Yes, exactly! And that's why...
Monica : Why don't you come over tonight, and I'll make your favorite dinner.
Ross : Thanks, you guys.
Ross : Are you wearing fur?
Phoebe : Let's get some perspective, people.
Phoebe : It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
UNK: You know, I think I kind of understand why I lost it today.
Ross : You do, huh?
Joey : You see...
Joey : ...I'm an actor, right?
UNK: So I got to keep my emotions right at the surface.
UNK: I got a lot of balls in the air, you know?
Joey : It's tough. Guys like me, you wander around, you're alone.
Ross : What are you talking about?
Joey : I'm not sure.
Monica : Look at you! Where have you been?
Rachel : I went to have pizza.
Rachel : With Danny.
All : -What happened? -That yeti is one smooth talker.
UNK: Yetis are smooth-talkers. That's why you never see any pictures of them.
UNK: "Come here, baby. Give me the camera."
Monica : I hope you're not full. Dinner's almost ready.
UNK: I think I'll probably just hang out in my room.
UNK: Why?
Rachel : Come on, you guys!
UNK: If Emily knew I was having dinner with you, she'd flip out.
Rachel : It's okay. I really don't mind.
UNK: Wait, wait. You know what? Just stay.
UNK: Please.
UNK: It would mean a lot for me if you stay.
UNK: Ross, I just
Joey : Please, just have dinner with us!
Rachel : Settle down.
UNK: All right. I'm sorry.
Joey : You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
Monica : Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back.
UNK: We haven't seen him in so long.
Phoebe : Oh, God! I really missed that fat bastard.
Monica : This is so weird.
UNK: I realized this may be the last time we hang out together.
Joey : It's almost as if he knew.
Monica : I'll get it.
Monica : Hi, Emily.
Monica : You tracked him down. Hold on.
Ross : Yeah, we're just having dinner.
