Danny : So you like the short hair better?
UNK: Yeti? Danny?
Danny : I had to cut my hair to get rid of...
Danny : ...the fogger smell.
Rachel : Listen, I'm so sorry. I would have never fogged you...
Rachel : ...if you hadn't looked so...
Danny : Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
UNK: What?
UNK: It's cool.
UNK: No, that is not cool.
Rachel : You don't even know me.
Danny : You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalog.
UNK: From that, you've got me all figured out?
Rachel : Well, you don't.
UNK: You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.
Joey : Do you?
UNK: You know, if kids like to play with capri pants.
Rachel : Stop saying that. I hate that!
Rachel : I judged you. I made a snap judgment.
Rachel : But you did it too, and you're worse. You're sticking to your judgment.
