Ross : Sure, hold on.
Ross : She wants to say hi.
Monica : Hi, Emily!
Emily : Hello, everyone.
Emily : So who am I saying hello to?
Joey : Well, I don't know about who's here...
UNK: ...but I can tell you who's not here, and that's Rachel!
Emily : I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
UNK: You know what? Rachel is here.
Emily : She's there?
UNK: Oh, yeah, there she is!
Ross : She's here.
Emily : Take me off speakerphone.
UNK: How could you do this to me?
UNK: I made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.
Ross : I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
UNK: -You can't keep away from her. -That's ridiculous.
Chandler : -Hello? Hello? -Who is this?
UNK: It's Ross. What are you doing?
UNK: Sorry, dude, I had to make a call.
UNK: Joey.
UNK: Joey, they don't have two lines, they have two phones.
UNK: Gotcha.
UNK: I'm sorry. Emily, listen. I have never cheated on you.
Ross : I'm moving for you. I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.
UNK: Please, get on the plane and come to New York, okay?
UNK: You're the only one I want to be with.
Emily : I'll feel better when I'm there. I can know where you are all the time.
Ross : You can't know where I am all the time.
UNK: This marriage will never work if you don't trust me.
Emily : You're right.
Ross : Can you trust me?
Joey : I think it's going okay.
Joey : Looks like he's smiling.
Monica : How can you tell? You can only see his back.
Joey : You can totally tell!
Joey : Here, look, watch me.
UNK: Smile.
Joey : Frown. Smile.
UNK: Frown.
UNK: Smile.
Ross : I guess that's it.
All : Why? What happened?
Ross : My marriage is over.
Monica : Look at you, you're shivering.
UNK: Here.
Rachel : Honey, is there anything we can do?
Ross : You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Phoebe : Stop tormenting me!
UNK: This is mink, okay? They're mean, and they hate squirrels.
Phoebe : Most of these probably wanted to be coats.
UNK: Fine. No, I get it.
UNK: Here.
Phoebe : You take it.
Phoebe : Are you happy now? I'm cold!
