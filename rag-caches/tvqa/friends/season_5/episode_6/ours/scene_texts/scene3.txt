UNK: I don't know what to do about this coat.
Gunther : I'll take it.
Phoebe : That might work.
Joey : What do you think?
UNK: You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.
Ross : No, it's just a bit sudden.
Ross : It's great, okay? I am totally onboard.
Ross : I love you too. All right, bye.
Joey : What's the matter?
UNK: Nothing. No, actually...
Ross : ...great news!
UNK: I just spoke with Emily...
UNK: ...and looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.
UNK: Why?
Ross : Her thought is, and I agree...
Ross : ...fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?
UNK: Her cousin has a place to sublet.
Ross : It's got a view of the river and Columbia.
Joey : That's way uptown! That's three trains away...
Joey : ...which is great!
Joey : I love to ride that rail.
UNK: You're okay with this?
UNK: It's kind of far from work...
UNK: ...but I'll get so much done on the commute.
Ross : I've been given the gift of time.
UNK: That's so funny. Last Christmas I got the gift of space.
Chandler : We should get them together and make a continuum.
UNK: Now he's moving?
Joey : Man, what is Emily doing to him?
Joey : He's not even here!
Rachel : You guys!
UNK: We were in the storage area, and we saw this creepy man.
UNK: It was this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.
UNK: It was like a Big Foot or a yeti or something.
Monica : He came at us, so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.
UNK: I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.
Joey : Like, dark hair, bushy beard?
Joey : Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Rachel : Please! We did not fog Danny.
Rachel : Who's Danny?
UNK: Danny just moved in.
UNK: He just got back from a four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Monica : He's nice. You know, you always...
Monica : ...stick up for the people we fog.
Rachel : You might not remember us, but we're the girls that fogged you.
Monica : We're really sorry we fogged you.
Rachel : Just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.
Rachel : We thought you were like a yeti or something.
UNK: Sorry to bother you, but we can't accept your acceptance of our apology.
UNK: It doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Monica : That guy is so rude!
UNK: Really! What is with that guy?
Rachel : You'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Monica : You did, a little bit.
Rachel : Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.
Monica : -I totally forgive you. -Really?
Phoebe : You know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Monica : Crematorium Chris? Sure.
UNK: He said he would cremate my fur coat for free...
UNK: ...if I bring in the next person I know who dies.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : Oh, my God. Look at these pelts!
Monica : Don't get too attached. She's having it cremated.
Rachel : You're quirky, and I get a big kick out of it. We all do.
