Chandler : And, of course, the Indians.
Monica : Of all people, you do not want me to tell this story.
UNK: What is that supposed to mean?
UNK: Mrs. Geller : -Monica, I think Rachel's here! -I'll get it!
Monica : Happy Thanksgiving!
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : Not for me.
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : Chip and I broke up.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Fat Monica : What happened?
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : My parents are out of town, and Chip was going to come over.
UNK: And you were going to give him...
UNK: ...your "flower."
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : Monica, can you just call it sex?
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : It really creeps me out when you call it that.
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : And by the way...
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : ...while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his "tenderness."
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : Believe me.
Monica : Happy Thanksgiving.
UNK: Everyone...
Ross : ...this is Chandler.
Ross : My roommate...
Ross : ...and lead singer of our band.
Ross : This is Monica.
UNK: I'm Ross' little sister.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : I'm so glad you could come.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : We've got plenty of food, so I hope you're hungry.
Ross : Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : I'm so glad you brought him here.
UNK: Fat Monica : I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Chandler : As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it.
UNK: Damn it!
Ross : Does it feel weird around here now?
UNK: You know, since I've been away at college?
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : Not really.
Ross : That's cool.
UNK: So that's Rachel, the girl you've been writing all those songs about?
UNK: Might want to rethink the lyrics to "She Feels Weird Since I've Been Gone."
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson!
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs.
UNK: Fat Monica : His begging days are over, now that he's with Nancy Branson.
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : I've just had it with high-school boys.
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : They're just silly.
UNK: They're just silly, stupid boys.
UNK: I'll start dating men.
Ross : I'm sorry, Judy.
Ross : I couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for.
UNK: Fat Monica : Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.
