UNK: Fat Monica : Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Chandler : It was great. You should be a chef.
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : Guess what.
UNK: All this stuff about Nancy being a slut was all a rumor.
UNK: Big Nosed Rachel : Chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house!
UNK: -That is so great! -I know.
UNK: Fat Monica : Oh, gosh. Listen, if you and Chip do it tonight...
UNK: Fat Monica : ...promise me you'll tell me everything.
UNK: Totally. It's not that big a deal. We already kind of did it once.
UNK: But now you'll definitely know whether or not you did it.
Rachel : I know.
UNK: And Chip promised that this time it'd last at least for an entire song.
UNK: I'm thinking of asking Rachel out tonight...
UNK: ...maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.

UNK: Fat Monica : No, thank you.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Judy, you did it.
UNK: Mr. Geller : She's finally full!
Chandler : I called you fat?
Chandler : -I don't even remember that. -Maybe it'd jog your memory...
UNK: ...if you guys played a little bit of "Emotional Knapsack."
UNK: I'm so sorry. I really am.
Chandler : I was an idiot back then.
Chandler : I rushed the stage at a Wham concert, for crying out loud!
Phoebe : I can't believe you called her fat.
Ross : I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Chandler : I am really sorry.
UNK: That is terrible. I'm so sorry.
