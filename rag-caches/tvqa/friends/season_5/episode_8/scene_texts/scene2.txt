UNK: More bandages!
UNK: More bandages!
UNK: Please, can I get some more bandages in here?
UNK: This man is
Ross : In this life, Phoebe.
Phoebe : Oh, this life. Oh, okay.
Phoebe : No, Chandler's is worse.
UNK: It must be cool remembering stuff like that.
UNK: I don't have any past-life memories.
Phoebe : Of course, you don't, sweetie. You're brand-new.
Rachel : I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Monica : Let's not tell this story.
Rachel : I know!
Phoebe : It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head.
Rachel : Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
Joey : It's not like it sounds.
Chandler : It's exactly like it sounds.
Phoebe : What's going on?
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Rachel : I know!
Joey : It's stuck!
UNK: Step.
Phoebe : How did it get on?
Joey : I put it on to scare Chandler.
UNK: Oh, my God! Monica's going to totally freak out!
Joey : Help me get it off!
Joey : Plus, it smells really bad in here.
UNK: Of course it smells bad. You have your head up a dead animal's ass.
Monica : Did you get the turkey?
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Monica : Who is that?
Joey : It's Joey.
Monica : Is this supposed to be funny?
Phoebe : It's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be scary.
UNK: Get that off now!
UNK: I can't. It's stuck!
UNK: It has to feed 20 people. They're not going to eat it off your head!
Phoebe : Hold on.
Phoebe : Let's just all think.
Monica : I got it!
Monica : You pull.
UNK: I'll spread the legs as wide as I can.
Monica : Now is not the time.
UNK: Count to three. One...
UNK: ...two...
UNK: ...three!
Joey : It worked! I scared you! I knew it!
UNK: I'm here, big guy.
Joey : Yeah, you are!
Joey : I scared you!
Chandler : You did look like an idiot.
Joey : I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
Joey : Remember when Ross tried to say "butternut squash"...
Joey : ...and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?
Ross : Yeah, that's the same.
Monica : That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving.
UNK: That can't be the one Rachel meant.
Phoebe : She didn't even know that happened.
UNK: So, what's yours?
Monica : I really don't want to tell this story.
UNK: Reliving pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about.
Chandler : For me, anyway.
