Rachel : Monica, that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever.
UNK: It was so good. I think you killed us.
Ross : I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Joey : I need something sweet.
UNK: Does anyone want to watch TV?
Phoebe : Monica, your remote doesn't work.
Monica : You have to lift it and point.
UNK: Oh, forget it.
UNK: Let's play that game where everyone says one thing they're thankful for.
Joey : I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Monica : Very nice.
UNK: The other day, I was at the bus stop...
UNK: ...and this lovely fall breeze came and blew this chick's skirt up.
UNK: Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
UNK: The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks
Joey : It's not so much an underpant as a feat of engineering.
Joey : It's amazing...
Joey : ...how much they can do with so little material.
UNK: And they play with your mind. Is it there? Is it not there?
Chandler : Are you aware that you're still talking?
Monica : Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
UNK: I don't know. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction?
Phoebe : And I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
UNK: I'm sorry. This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
Chandler : I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
UNK: You can't swoop in with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
UNK: You're not going to tell about your parents' divorce again, are you?
UNK: Come on! I want to hear it.
Joey : It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out.
Chandler : It's a tradition, like the parade.
Chandler : If the parade decided it was gay and abandoned its family.
