Ross : You know where his injury is. Severed toe, you just said it!
UNK: It says the knife went through your shoe.
UNK: Mr. Geller : They're made of wicker!
UNK: The Doctor : Did you bring the toe?
Monica : I have it right here on ice.
UNK: Toes on Ice, coming soon to Madison Square Garden.
UNK: Save your strength, man.
UNK: The Doctor : Don't worry, son. We'll just reattach it and then...
Monica : What is it?
UNK: The Doctor : You brought a carrot.
UNK: The Doctor : This isn't your toe. This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
UNK: The Doctor : You brought a carrot?
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : There's a toe in my kitchen.
UNK: I'm sorry! I'll go get it!
UNK: The Doctor : All we can do now is sew up the wound.
Chandler : Without my toe? I need my toe!
Monica : I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I'm not falling for that one.
Chandler : That's why I lost my toe? Because I called you fat?
Monica : I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Chandler : That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?
Ross : I'm sorry.
Monica : It wasn't your whole toe.
Chandler : Yeah, well, I miss the tip.
Chandler : It's the best part.
Chandler : It has the nail.
Chandler : Sir Limps-a-lot.
Ross : I came up with that.
Joey : You're a dork.
Chandler : -I can't believe this. -I said I was sorry.
UNK: "Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy that cried all the way home.
UNK: It figures that something like this would happen today.
Chandler : I hate this stupid day and everything about it!
Chandler : I'll see you later.
UNK: Wait.
Monica : Come here.
Monica : Is there anything I can do? Anything?
UNK: Just leave me alone for a little while.
Chandler : I'm a duck. I go quack-quack.
UNK: I'm happy all the time.
Chandler : Nice try.
Monica : Wait, wait, wait.
Chandler : Look, Monica
Chandler : This is not going to work.
Monica : I bet this will work.
Chandler : You're so great.
Chandler : I love you.
UNK: Nothing. I said you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.
Monica : You said you loved me. I can't believe this!
Chandler : No, I didn't!
Monica : Yes, you did!
Chandler : No, I didn't!
Monica : You love me!
Chandler : No, I don't!
Chandler : Stop it, stop it, stop it!
UNK: Gauze!
UNK: Gauze!
UNK: I need to get some gauze in here!
UNK: Can I please get some more gauze?
UNK: This is getting ridiculous.
