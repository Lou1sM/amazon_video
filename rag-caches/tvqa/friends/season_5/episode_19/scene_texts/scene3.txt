UNK: This is a girl I really like, and you had to swoop in there!
UNK: What?
UNK: Chandler was flirting with the hot delivery girl.
Chandler : Thank you for that.
Chandler : I was not flirting.
Monica : It's okay. I don't care. That's fine.
UNK: Really?
Monica : It's no big deal. I do it all the time.
Chandler : You flirt with guys all the time?
Monica : It doesn't mean anything. Just like it doesn't mean anything with you.
UNK: There's a difference. You're a lot hotter.
Joey : True story.
Monica : This actually bothers you?
UNK: Yes, and I think it'd bother a lot of people.
UNK: When you and Ross dated...
Chandler : ...did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Rachel : No, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Ross : And thank you for that.
UNK: I never had to worry.
UNK: He was never good at the flirting thing.
UNK: What are you talking about? It worked with you.
UNK: No, you're right.
UNK: We met, you flirted and then bam! Nine years later, you had me.
Ross : All right.
UNK: You know what I'll do? I'll order another pizza.
Ross : And when Caitlin gets here...
UNK: ...I will show you how well I flirt.
Ross : I will get her phone number.
Ross : And not the one on the menu.
Phoebe : -I found it. -Thank God! Where was it?
