Phoebe : On your dresser.
Rachel : Okay, that is the one we already have.
Joey : Here's my big scene. My big scene's here.
UNK: -Wanna bet nobody heard anything? -No bet.
UNK: Anybody home?
Joey : -Oh, my God. -What?
UNK: Everybody keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Chandler : What is it?
Joey : They cut me out of the show.
UNK: What?
Ross : -Are you sure? -Maybe your scene's coming up.
UNK: Not likely. Because you see that body bag right there?
Joey : I'm in it.
Phoebe : This is terrible. What'll you do?
Joey : I don't know. This little old lady lives for my career.
Joey : When they dumped me off Days of Our Lives, she almost died.
Phoebe : That's not good.
UNK: -Yeah, we had to get her a home nurse. -Oh, my God.
UNK: Yeah, she almost died and got really expensive.
UNK: You're not smiling. Not that face! Everybody smile!
Rachel : Just tell her what happened. It's not your fault.
Chandler : If we keep talking this way, won't we freak her out soon?
Joey : Soon. I'm gonna be on soon.
Joey : There I am!
UNK: Grandma Tribbiani : Sam Waterston!
UNK: No, no. That's me. That's me!
UNK: Grandma Tribbiani : No. Sam Waterston.
UNK: Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.
UNK: She doesn't know "hello," but she knows Capricorn One.
Phoebe : I need those earrings. We're leaving when the show's over.
Phoebe : But I already gave them back to you.
Monica : No, you didn't.
UNK: I already didn't gave them back to you. That's what I said.
UNK: Where's that other earring?
UNK: It's not here, Phoebe. It's not here.
UNK: I went to Chandler's last night.
Phoebe : Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Rachel : Chandler has a jewelry box?
UNK: We have 10 minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?
UNK: Hey, Phoebe.
Ross : How's that...
Caitlin : ...vegetarian pizza working out for you?
Ross : You and those vegetables have a real...
Ross : ...thing going on, huh?
Phoebe : Why are you being weird?
Ross : Do you like it?
Phoebe : No. That'd be, "Why are you being cute?"
Ross : Okay. I'm working on my flirting.
Phoebe : I did not get that.
UNK: So, Monica, do you like Law and Order?
Monica : Yeah, it's good.
UNK: I found out all this stuff about you. You like Law and Order...
UNK: ...and you've flirted with every guy in the tri-state area.
Monica : Okay, let me get this straight.
Monica : It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?
UNK: I'm glad we cleared that up.
UNK: I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and women.
UNK: Teach me about men and women.
Chandler : I've already taught you so much already, but whatever.
Chandler : When you flirt with a guy, you think, "No big deal."
UNK: But he thinks, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
Monica : -No way! -It's true.
Monica : -Well, that's pathetic. -Again, true.
Monica : -This goes for all guys? -All guys that are awake.
Chandler : We go to sleep.
UNK: All guys from the other end of the world wake up and act the same way.
Joey : It's another commercial and I still haven't told her.
UNK: Joey, this is the last commercial.
UNK: -You got 10 minutes left. -I know!
UNK: What am I gonna do?
UNK: You will not run out and leave her here.
Joey : Yeah, all right.
UNK: Joey's gonna be right back. Right back?
UNK: Meanwhile, let's talk about you.
Chandler : So you're old and small.
