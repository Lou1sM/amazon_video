Ross : Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Chandler : Monica and I are celebrating our 10-month anniversary.
UNK: Got reservations at Jean-George.
Ross : How'd you get in?
UNK: Made a few calls, pulled some strings...
UNK: ...and they'll seat us if we both have chicken and don't get dessert.
UNK: -Hi, Chandler. -Hey, Caitlin.
Chandler : Somebody got a haircut.
Caitlin : I hate it. I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Chandler : If that was true, gym class would've been more interesting.
UNK: -It's $27 even. -Okay. Here you go.
Caitlin : Where's the chicken?
UNK: It's in the back. The duck pissed him off.
UNK: He said that eggs came first.
UNK: -Thanks. I'll see you later. -Bye.
Ross : What the hell was that?
UNK: -What? -The flirting.
Ross : Aren't you supposed to be going out with, let's see, my sister?
UNK: I wasn't flirting.
Ross : It was totally flirting! "Somebody got a haircut..."
Chandler : First of all, the impression? Uncanny.
UNK: Second, that wasn't flirting. That was just casual conversation.
Ross : Yeah, right.
Chandler : You wanna see flirting? I'll show you.
Ross : I'm good.
UNK: The One Where Ross Can't Flirt
Rachel : I am so proud of Joey.
UNK: -He's gonna be on Law and Order! -I know.
UNK: Don't you think it should be called Order and Law?
UNK: No, because they arrest the guy and then try him.
Phoebe : Don't get me started on that.
Chandler : -I was not flirting. -And on your anniversary. For shame!
Rachel : What's going on?
UNK: He was hitting on the hot delivery girl.
Chandler : I was not. And oh, God!
UNK: You were. If anyone should be hitting on her...
Ross : ...it's the guy who's single...
UNK: ...the guy who can do something about it.
UNK: Sounds like someone wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Chandler : Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Rachel : Ross, we broke up two years ago. You've been married since then.
Rachel : I think it's okay that we see other people.
Ross : I was watching her at the pizza place.
UNK: And she was just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
Rachel : We don't need her measurements.
Phoebe : Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.
Phoebe : She's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?
Phoebe : She forgot my vegetarian.
Ross : This is perfect. She'll have to come back here with your pizza.
Ross : And when she does, I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.
UNK: I am so glad you don't eat meat.
Phoebe : See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Joey : Hey, everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother.
Rachel : -Big night! -Yeah, it's so cool.
UNK: Joey on Law and Order. You must be proud.
Joey : She doesn't understand a word of English.
Chandler : I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.
Chandler : I've done it again.
UNK: Nonnie's my biggest fan.
Joey : She's the only one in the family who's always believed in me.
UNK: Si. Big star.
UNK: My big fat Joey star.
UNK: Yeah, I weighed, like, 27 pounds when I was born.
