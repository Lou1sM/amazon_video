Phoebe : -Did you find it? -The earring, no.
UNK: But I found my sunglasses.
Rachel : I've been looking for these since last summer.
UNK: Those are mine. You borrowed them from me.
Rachel : Okay. Calm down. Here they are.
UNK: -What do we do? -I don't know. I don't know!
UNK: We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.
UNK: Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.
UNK: I could tell her it was all my fault.
UNK: Oh, that'd be great.
UNK: Mon, could I talk to you?
Monica : Yeah. What is it?
Phoebe : I lost one of your earrings.
Phoebe : I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.
UNK: All right, what can you do? If you lost it, you lost it.
Phoebe : I'll replace it. I promise. I feel so terrible.
Monica : That's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Monica : Look at you. Come here.
UNK: -You feel better? -Yeah. You're the best.
Rachel : Okay, wait a minute.
Rachel : I can't do this.
Rachel : Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.
Rachel : She lent me the earrings.
Rachel : I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey. I feel terrible too.
Monica : That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!
UNK: First, my jewelry. If it's not that, it's my sweater.
UNK: And if it's not that, it's my sunglasses.
Rachel : Your sunglasses?
Phoebe : Oh, right.
UNK: -Pizza. -Mine, mine, mine!
Ross : Okay, here goes.
Ross : Prepare yourselves for some class-A flirting.
Chandler : Okay, hold on.
Rachel : If you really like this girl, I don't think flirting is the right way
Ross : You'll see.
Ross : What's her name?
UNK: Caitlin!
Ross : We can't keep eating like this.
Caitlin : It's $12.50.
Ross : Do you make the pizzas in one of those wood-burning ovens?
UNK: No, actually, I think they're gas.
UNK: Gas?
UNK: Intense.
UNK: If this is how all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
UNK: You know that smell gas has?
Ross : They put that in.
UNK: -What? -The gas is odorless.
Ross : But they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Caitlin : Well, okay.
Ross : A lot of other gas smells.
Chandler : Oh, the humanity!
Ross : Methane smells...
Ross : You know what? Actually, I really should go.
UNK: -But I haven't paid you yet. -That's okay.
Caitlin : You guys have ordered so many that this one's on me.
Ross : Was I talking to her about gas?
Chandler : More so than anything else.
Phoebe : I found it interesting.
Ross : I'm sorry.
Ross : Don't worry about it.
Ross : In nine years, she and I will be right there!
Rachel : I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Phoebe : What else do they add smell to?
UNK: Grandma Tribbiani : Caitlin! Caitlin!
UNK: Hi, I'm Rachel.
