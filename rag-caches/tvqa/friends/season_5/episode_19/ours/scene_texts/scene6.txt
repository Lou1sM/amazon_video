UNK: The people with all the pizza.
UNK: Was there a problem?
UNK: No, they're fine. Great pizza.
UNK: But, actually, my friend Ross...
UNK: ...he gets nervous when he's flirting.
Joey : Oh, my God!
Caitlin : That was flirting?
Joey : I know, I know.
Rachel : I'm telling you, once you get past that part...
UNK: ...where it feels like you wanna die...
UNK: ...he's a really good person.
Caitlin : The guy with the gas?
Rachel : I'm telling you, he's really sweet and really funny...
UNK: ...and he's just got a good heart.
UNK: You know, actually, I did think that he was cute and then he started talking.
UNK: See, there you go.
UNK: -Besides, I think he really likes you. -Really?
UNK: Well, we have seven people and 10 pizzas. What do you think?
Caitlin : I thought Joey was there.
UNK: Yeah, no, but just I'm telling you he's worth a shot.
UNK: Well, if he's so great why don't you go out with him?
UNK: Well, you know, at some point...
UNK: ...you and I may need to have a longer conversation.
Rachel : Hey, Ross?
Rachel : I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway.
Rachel : You must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
UNK: -What? -I don't get it, but she wanted me...
UNK: ...to give you her number.
Ross : And she just gave you this?
Ross : Rach, thanks. But I don't need you doing me any favors.
Rachel : I didn't. She thought you were cute.
Ross : Well, that I can believe.
Joey : Hey, is the show still on?
Chandler : Almost over, man.
UNK: Hey, Nonnie.
Joey : Is that the pope?
Chandler : Why am I looking?

Joey : All right, back off!
UNK: I got a gun!
Joey : I'm not afraid to use it.
UNK: That's right, Nonnie.
Chandler : You couldn't have at least changed your shirt?
UNK: Now, I want a suitcase filled with $ 100,000
UNK: Filled with $ 100,000 in small bills.
Joey : And if I don't get Shoo!
Joey : And if I don't get it...
UNK: ...I'll shoot this duck!
