UNK: -You've got to go home. -But I like it here.
UNK: Get the earrings you borrowed. He wants me to wear them.
UNK: I think they're in my purse. Go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Phoebe : I need those earrings you borrowed.
Rachel : Yeah, I'll be right back.
UNK: Phoebe, you speak Italian?
Phoebe : I guess so.
Chandler : -Here you go. -Thanks. Where's the other one?
UNK: Oh, what, you want both of them? That's a little greedy, don't you think?
UNK: Rachel Karen Greene, where's the other one?
Rachel : Look, just don't freak out, but I kind of lost it.
Rachel : I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
UNK: What'll I tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight.
Rachel : -Tell her to wear her own earrings. -These are her earrings.
UNK: You lent me her earrings? I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Phoebe : -Why not? -Because I lose her stuff!
UNK: You see that blind guy? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
UNK: My big scene's coming up. The big scene coming up.
Chandler : If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up," would she know the difference?
Monica : What are you doing?
UNK: Oh, I just can't watch. It's too scary.
Monica : It's a diaper commercial.
Rachel : Yeah, well, you know me. Babies, responsibilities...
Phoebe : -Pizza delivery. -I'll get it! I will get that!
UNK: How does my hair look?
UNK: Ross, it hasn't moved since 1996.
Caitlin : One vegetarian pizza. It's 12.50.
Ross : By the way, if it makes you feel any better...
Ross : ...I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
UNK: What?
Ross : Your hair. Before. Your hair.
UNK: You said you thought your hair looked like an 8-year-old boy's...
Ross : ...and I'm just saying I like it.
Ross : The hair.
UNK: Thanks.
Ross : You understand, I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Caitlin : All I'm looking for is the money.
Chandler : Here you go. Stop bringing us pizzas, you.
Caitlin : I'm gonna try.
Chandler : You're welcome.
Ross : You couldn't let me have her, could you?
