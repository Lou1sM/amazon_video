UNK: Mon? I gotta ask you something.
UNK: Now?
Rachel : Ross said my name. I can't just pretend it didn't happen.
UNK: I don't know.
Rachel : Monica, what should I do?
Monica : Just do the right thing.
UNK: What?
UNK: Tow the line! Thread the needle! Think outside the box!
UNK: I'll talk to Ross about what he thinks it meant.
Monica : Wait! Rachel, no.
UNK: He's married.
UNK: Married.
UNK: If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
UNK: Okay. You're right.
UNK: You're right. You can't help me.
