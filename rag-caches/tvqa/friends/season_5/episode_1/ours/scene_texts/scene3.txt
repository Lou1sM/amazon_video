UNK: His obsession begins to grow, right?
UNK: Why don't we go change in my room?
Monica : My clothes are...
Chandler : Wow, you look
Monica : No time for that.
Joey : Hey, dude! Let me in! I got a girl out here!
UNK: I got a girl in here!
UNK: No, you don't. I saw you go in with Monica.
UNK: Well, we're hanging out.
UNK: Which one of us will be having sex in there? Me or you?
UNK: I suppose I would have to say you.
UNK: -What if we're watching a movie? -Which we are!
UNK: And we've paid for it.
UNK: It's My Giant.
Monica : My Giant?
Joey : I love that movie!
Monica : Think this is okay?
Chandler : Well, Ross and Emily aren't going to use it.
UNK: Oh, it's so beautiful!
UNK: I don't feel right about this.
Chandler : This is the honeymoon suite.
Chandler : The room expects sex.
Chandler : The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
UNK: All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Chandler : Nope! Not under here!
UNK: -You didn't find her? -I've looked everywhere.
UNK: You couldn't have, or you would've found her.
Monica : -Keep looking! -Yeah! For about 30 minutes?
Monica : Or 45?
Chandler : In 45 minutes, you could find her twice.
UNK: For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't, because I kept moving.
Ross : From now on, I'm staying in one place.
Ross : Right here.
UNK: -It's getting late. -We're going to go.
Ross : Do you guys mind staying here for a while?
UNK: We've got to get up early and catch that plane.
UNK: Yeah, it's a very large plane.
UNK: That's cool.
UNK: But we'll stay here with you.
Ross : Thanks, guys!
Ross : I really appreciate this, but you don't need to rub my butt.
UNK: We have to leave in an hour.
UNK: I know. I've been looking at those doors.
UNK: They look pretty soundproof, don't you think?
UNK: We can't do that. That's insane.
UNK: I mean, A, he could wake up. And B, you know...
UNK: ...let's go for it.
