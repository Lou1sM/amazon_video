UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: I don't understand.
UNK: How could she do this?
UNK: Am I a complete idiot for thinking she'd actually show up?
UNK: You're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.

UNK: Well, that's that.
Rachel : No, you know what?

UNK: Well, I don't know, Ross. Really?
UNK: Yeah. It'd be great. I mean, you can...
Ross : You can lay on the beach...
Ross : ...and I can cry over my failed marriage.
UNK: You see how I make jokes?
Ross : Really. I mean...
Ross : I could use a friend.
UNK: Oh, wow. Maybe.
