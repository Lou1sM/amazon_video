UNK: Mrs. Geller : Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Who serves steak when there's no place to sit?
UNK: Mr. Geller : How are you supposed to eat this?
UNK: Hey, what's up?
UNK: You and me, next dance?
UNK: Sorry, dear, I only dance when I'm drunk.
UNK: Want me to get you something?
Monica : We were supposed to meet.
UNK: -Forget it. That's off. -Why?
UNK: Mr. Waltham : The next tour of the wine cellar...
UNK: ...will commence in two minutes.
Monica : Joey, what are you doing?
UNK: You promised, no meat till Phoebe has the babies.
UNK: We're in another country, so it doesn't count.
UNK: -True. -He's got a point.
UNK: I'm sorry things aren't working out.
Ross : It could be better. It'll be okay, right?
Rachel : Oh, yeah! Of course. She'll get over this.
Rachel : So you said my name.
Rachel : You just said it because you saw me there.
UNK: If you'd seen a circus freak, you would've said :
Rachel : "I take thee, Circus Freak."
UNK: It didn't mean anything. It's a mistake.
UNK: It didn't mean anything. Right?
UNK: Oh, no! Of course it didn't mean anything.
Ross : I can understand why Emily thought it meant something...
Ross : ...because it was you.
UNK: But it absolutely didn't. It didn't! It didn't!
UNK: The band's ready for your first dance with Emily.
UNK: Oh! The band's ready!
UNK: We've got to do what the band says. I don't care about the stupid band!
Joey : You spit on me, man!
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: Emily is taking kind of a long time.
UNK: When I locked myself up at my wedding...
Rachel : ...I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Rachel : Get the hell out of there. You know?
UNK: I'm coming in!
UNK: Oh, look at that. Same thing.
Chandler : In the middle of everything, if I scream, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Monica : -Oh, my God! Rachel! -Oh, hello, Rachel.
Rachel : Ross said my name.
Rachel : Okay? My name!
Rachel : Ross said my name up there.
Rachel : That obviously means he still loves me!
UNK: Don't believe me. I know I'm right.
Rachel : Do you guys want to go and get a drink?
Chandler : Yes, we do.
Chandler : But we have to change first.
Monica : Yes, I want to change.
UNK: -Go get a table. -We'll only be five minutes.
Monica : Fifteen minutes.
UNK: Oh, Phoebe! It's Phoebe!
UNK: -Oh, hey, hey. -Oh, great.
Phoebe : So, what happened?
Rachel : Well, Ross said my name.
UNK: But I don't think that means anything.
UNK: Let's look at this objectively.
Rachel : Ninth grade, right?
Rachel : The obsession starts.
UNK: Then he sees me in a two-piece for the first time.
