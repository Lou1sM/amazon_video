Minister : Friends, family, we're gathered to celebrate...
Minister : ...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.
Minister : Now, Ross, repeat after me.
UNK: "I, Ross."
Minister : I, Ross.
UNK: "Take thee, Emily."
Ross : Take thee, Rachel.
Minister : Shall I go on?
UNK: He said, "Rachel," right?
Rachel : Do you think I should go up there?
Emily : Yes. Yes. Do go on.
UNK: I think we'd better start again.
Minister : Repeat after me.
UNK: "I, Ross."
Minister : I, Ross.
UNK: "Take thee, Emily."
Minister : Take thee, Emily.
UNK: Like there'd be anybody else.
UNK: "As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health...
UNK: ...till death parts us."
Minister : As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health...
Ross : ...until death parts us.
Ross : Really, I do. Emily.
UNK: Do you have the rings?
UNK: Place this ring on Ross' finger...
Minister : ...as a symbol of your bond everlasting.
Minister : Ross, place this ring...
UNK: ...on Emily's hand as a symbol...
Minister : ...of the love that encircles you forever.
Ross : Happy to.
UNK: They have made their declarations...
Minister : ...and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Minister : You may kiss the bride.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Emily : Just keep smiling.
Joey : Well, that went well.
UNK: It could've been worse. He could've shot her.
UNK: That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
UNK: You spoiled everything! It's a nightmare!
Emily : My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?
UNK: No matter what happens with them...
Joey : ...we still get cake, right?
UNK: That's all right. You take your time. I'll be right out here.
UNK: She's just fixing her makeup.
Emily : I hate you!
Ross : And I love you!
UNK: A bad time to say the wrong name, huh?
UNK: That's true. Thanks, Dad.
Ross : People should be dancing.
Ross : This is a party! Come on!
Ross : Joey! Dance!
UNK: Mrs. Waltham : Yes, Waltham Interiors.
UNK: This is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Filangie.
UNK: Who?
UNK: I discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine.
Phoebe : Without it, in the brain of Ross...
UNK: ...women's names are interchangeable.
Phoebe : Through no fault of his own.
UNK: Mrs. Waltham : Oh, my God! Phoebe.
UNK: No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.
Phoebe : Oh, no! You have it too!
UNK: What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor?
UNK: I hope you don't take this the wrong way...
Chandler : ...but I know we had plans to meet up tonight.
UNK: I'm worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Chandler : I know.
Monica : -How could we have let this happen? -Seven times!
UNK: You know, look. We were away.
Chandler : In a foreign, romantic country.
Monica : I blame London.
Chandler : Bad London!
Monica : So look...
UNK: ...while we're still in London, we can keep doing it, right?
UNK: Well, I don't see that we have a choice.
UNK: But when we're back home, we don't do it.
Monica : Only here.
UNK: You know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs.
UNK: I'll meet you there in two minutes.
