Rachel : I feel blue.
Monica : I bet you anything he'll call you again.
UNK: Yeah, maybe. But, you know, I don't think I even care.
UNK: I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
UNK: I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.
Rachel : But as it turns out...
UNK: ...I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Rachel : Yeah, maybe.
UNK: And I'm just trying to figure out why.
Phoebe : Any luck?
UNK: You know how Ross and I have always been on-again, off-again?
Rachel : I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road...
Rachel : ...we would be on again.
UNK: Again.
UNK: You know what? I think we all did.
UNK: I got us reservations for Sunday night.
UNK: How about Ernie's at 9 : 00?
UNK: Well, you'd better make it for three.
UNK: I don't know if we're going to be hungry at three.
Rachel : Three people.
UNK: Joshua's not going to be there.
Ross : What happened?
UNK: Well, I think he broke up with me.
UNK: No. Why?
Rachel : Apparently, he scares easy.
UNK: Rachel, I'm sorry.
UNK: It's okay.
UNK: Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.
Ross : Come here.
UNK: Don't you have to go pick up Emily?
UNK: -Are you okay? -Yeah. I got my girls.
UNK: Hey, you know what might cheer you up?
UNK: What?
UNK: I got to tell you...
UNK: ...this really does put me in a better mood.
Monica : I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.
Monica : Maybe someday there will be.
UNK: Chandler's coming by to borrow candles for his big date.
UNK: Rachel, don't get it! He'll see us!
Phoebe : The groom cannot see the bride.
UNK: I'm not going to marry Chandler.
Phoebe : Not after this!
UNK: Okay guys, just relax.
Joey : I do!
UNK: I got to go.
UNK: Yeah, well, that ought to do it.
UNK: Food's here. Fair enough.
UNK: Fifteen-minute warning.
UNK: Late.
Joey : Dude, I am trying to sleep!
