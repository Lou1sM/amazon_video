UNK: They'll be engaged for like what? A year?
UNK: One of them will realize what they've done...
UNK: ...and call it off.
UNK: You'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.
UNK: You know, I don't dance at weddings.
Rachel : Why not?
Chandler : Weddings are a great place to meet women.
Chandler : When I dance, I look like this.
Ross : Hey, man.
UNK: What are you doing four weeks from today?
UNK: -Nothing. -Nothing.
Chandler : I am...
UNK: ...free.
UNK: Because we're getting married in a month.
UNK: -What? -Yes.
Ross : In a month?
Rachel : -You mean 30 days? -Yeah.
Rachel : From now?
UNK: That's great!
UNK: She always wanted to get married where her parents did...
UNK: ...but it's getting torn down.
UNK: I know it's crazy, but everything's been so crazy...
UNK: ...and it just feels right.
UNK: Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating!
UNK: This isn't mine.
Joshua : -Hey, Rachel. -Hi.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: Your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
UNK: Nothing. I just wanted to see you.
Rachel : See you and hug you.
Rachel : See you...
UNK: Great!
UNK: Sit.
Joshua : You okay?
UNK: I'm more than okay. I am really, really happy.
UNK: Want to know why?
Joey : Do I?
UNK: Because I am really happy about us.
Rachel : I think we are so on the right track.
Rachel : I think we are working. I think we are clicking.
UNK: -You know? -Yeah, sure, sure.
Rachel : We're clicking.
Rachel : If there was just one little area where...
UNK: ...I think we need to work on, I would think...
UNK: ...it's that we're just not crazy enough.
UNK: I got to say, I'm not too sure I agree with that.
UNK: You know, yeah, you're right.
Rachel : We have our fun. Yeah?
UNK: I mean, like crazy! You know?
UNK: Are you gonna put on that cheerleader outfit again?
UNK: No. You wish.
Chandler : All right.
UNK: This is going to sound, you know, a little hasty.
UNK: But just go with me.
Rachel : What if we got married?
UNK: -What? -Oh, I know. It's so totally like...
Rachel : ..."Whoa, can we do this?" You know?
UNK: But it just feels right. Don't you think it does?
Rachel : I mean, it just feels right. Don't you...?
UNK: Rachel...
UNK: ...you're...
Monica : ...a real...
Joshua : ...special lady.
UNK: But my divorce isn't final yet...
UNK: ...and we've been on four dates.
UNK: So I'm thinking : No...
UNK: ...but...
UNK: ...thanks.
Gunther : You idiot!
