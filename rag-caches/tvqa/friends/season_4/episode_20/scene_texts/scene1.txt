UNK: Gunther, could I get another cup of coffee?
Chandler : So what do you do when you're not working here?
UNK: -You don't need to fill these silences. -Okay, thanks.
UNK: That's your fourth cup of coffee.
UNK: Okay, do me. I've had a certain number of juices.
UNK: I'm exhausted because Joey started snoring.
UNK: He's in a different room. He's that loud?
UNK: You should hear me.
UNK: It's nothing to be proud of. Go to a sleep clinic.
UNK: I'm not going to any clinic.
UNK: I don't have a problem. You have the problem.
UNK: You should go to a "Quit-being- a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.
UNK: -They don't have those. -Yeah, they do.
Joey : Quit being a baby and leave me alone!
UNK: There, you just had your first class.
UNK: I used to date a light sleeper.
UNK: Whenever I snored, he rolled me over
Ross : Oh, yeah!
UNK: He'd roll me over, and I'd stop snoring.
Chandler : Next time you snore, I'm rolling you over!
Joey : I gotta do what I gotta do. You gotta do what you gotta do.
Ross : Hey, guys.
Phoebe : Oh, the Olympics!
UNK: -Have you picked a date? -No. Not yet.
Phoebe : I still cannot believe you're engaged.
UNK: Because it's so fast. Not because you're a loser.
Ross : Thanks. Has anyone seen Rach?
UNK: She's upstairs not doing the dishes.
UNK: I won't do them this time. Even if they sit there until...
UNK: I'll do them when I get home.
Ross : Emily found this wedding dress in London
UNK: -Already? -But it didn't fit.
UNK: There's a store here with one left in her size. But the groom can't see
UNK: -I'll pick it up for you. -Thanks.
UNK: She's got you running errands, picking up wedding dresses...
UNK: Wah-pah!
UNK: What's wah-pah?
UNK: You know. Whipped.
UNK: Wah-pah!
UNK: That's not whipped.
Joey : Whipped is...
UNK: That's what I did.
UNK: You can't do anything!
Rachel : Hey, Mon. I was just doing these dishes.
Ross : Do you have a minute?
Rachel : I was just about to take a break anyway.
Ross : So listen...
UNK: ...I know we haven't had a chance to talk...
Ross : ...since Emily and I decided to get married.
Ross : And I was just wondering how you were.
Ross : If you were getting married, I would feel kind of...
UNK: You know?
Rachel : It definitely took me by surprise. But, you know...
UNK: ...I'm okay.
Ross : I just wanted to check.
UNK: That's sweet. Thank you.
