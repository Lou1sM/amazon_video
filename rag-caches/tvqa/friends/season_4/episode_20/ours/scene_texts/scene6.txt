Marjorie : I talk in my sleep.
Chandler : What a coincidence! I listen in my sleep.
UNK: So why don't you give me your number?
UNK: Are you ready?
Phoebe : I got it! Mine!
UNK: -Congratulations! -Thank you!
Monica : My turn, my turn!
Monica : Okay, ready?
Monica : That was a terrible throw!
UNK: I won't throw it right to you. That's not real.
Monica : Look at me. My big concern is what's real?
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: We're really sad, aren't we?
Phoebe : Yeah, I think we are.
UNK: This isn't even my dress.
UNK: At least you didn't rent yours from a store called "It's Not Too Late."
UNK: -I'm changing out of this. -Me, too.
UNK: In half an hour?
Phoebe : Me, too.
UNK: All right, now throw it straight this time.
UNK: I'm getting married!
Phoebe : I hate my regular clothes now.
UNK: I look down and I know...
UNK: ...this won't be the most special day of my life.
UNK: I mean, it was kind of fun for a while...
UNK: ...but didn't you feel kind of silly?
Phoebe : I guess.
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: You're such a cheater!
Chandler : Hello, little ones.
UNK: -So, is Joey going to stop snoring? -Yep!
Chandler : And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
Chandler : Joey wanted to ask her out, but, you know, she picked me.
UNK: How'd that happen?
UNK: Because I'm cooler.
Monica : No, seriously.
UNK: She's the kind of girl... Joey was unconscious.
Joey : Hey, you guys! What's happening?
Monica : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : What is that?
Joey : They gave it to me at the sleep clinic...
UNK: ...and it's going to help me not to snore.
Monica : Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?
UNK: You don't have to wear it unless you are.
UNK: I know I don't have to.
Joey : It tastes good.
Chandler : Plus, you look cool.
UNK: Hope I didn't stretch Emily's dress.
UNK: Your butt's not that much bigger than her's.
Rachel : I just called Joshua.
UNK: How'd it go?
Rachel : I did my best to convince him that I'm not...
UNK: ...some crazy girl who's dying to get married.
UNK: And I'm going through a hard time.
UNK: What'd he say?
Rachel : His answering machine was very understanding.
