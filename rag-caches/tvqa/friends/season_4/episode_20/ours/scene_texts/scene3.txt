UNK: You know what would make me happy?
UNK: You know, what's that?
UNK: If the four of us could all, you know, hang out together.
UNK: Emily's coming into town this weekend.
UNK: Why don't we all have dinner Sunday night?
Rachel : That would be great!
UNK: All right. It's a date!
UNK: "Hang in there." You hang in there.
Ross : -Did you say something? -No, just singing.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Monica : Look at this one!
UNK: It's so beautiful.
UNK: About half of these will end up getting divorced.
UNK: The Saleslady : May I help you ladies?
UNK: I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.
UNK: What's the name?
Monica : -Emily Waltham. -Yes, I have it right here.
UNK: The Saleslady : Would you like to try it on, Miss Waltham?
UNK: You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
UNK: I am, aren't I?
UNK: Miss Waltham?
UNK: We're closing.
Chandler : All right.
UNK: The Saleslady : And could I get my ring back?
Chandler : All right, buddy. Time to roll over.
Chandler : You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic!
UNK: And a pajama store!
Monica : Does she use the cups?
Monica : Yes, I believe she does.
Monica : Does she use the plates? Yes, I believe she does!
Ross : Thank you.
Monica : Thank you very much.
Monica : Thank you for coming.
Monica : -Just a second. -No, no! Let me in!
UNK: Can you hold on a minute?
Phoebe : No! You have to let me in right now!
Monica : Are you alone?
Chandler : All right.
Joey : This sucks.
UNK: I have to stay up all night before I go to the stupid clinic.
UNK: I'm so tired.
UNK: It's six o'clock.
UNK: I hear you and Joshua are going out with Ross and Emily.
UNK: I think that's really cool.
UNK: I think you're handling that really well.
UNK: "Handling it"?
UNK: There's nothing to handle.
Rachel : Maybe I'd have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
UNK: They're not going to get married anyway.
Rachel : They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!
