UNK: You're great.
UNK: And I know someday this will happen for you too.

UNK: "Hang in there"?
UNK: No, I didn't mean...
UNK: You haven't heard of a serious relationship called "me and Joshua"?
UNK: I thought you had just been on four dates.
UNK: I didn't realize that had become anything.
UNK: Oh no, it has become.
Rachel : Oh no, those were four great dates.
UNK: I mean, and the connection!
Rachel : Emotionally, mentally. You know?
UNK: Physically.
UNK: -That's incredible. -I know, isn't it?

Ross : I gotta get to work.
