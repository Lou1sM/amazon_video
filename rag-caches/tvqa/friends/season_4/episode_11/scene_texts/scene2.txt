Chandler : I want our love to grow before moving to the next level.
Rachel : Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
Ross : That is really nice...
UNK: ...Iying!
Ross : -No way is that the reason. -Why?
UNK: Because you're not mature enough to understand that?
UNK: He's right. I'm totally lying.
Monica : Then what is it?
UNK: Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
UNK: And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?
UNK: I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.
Ross : -I was going for the metaphor. -I was saying the actual words.
UNK: He's had a lot of girlfriends. Doesn't mean he's great in bed.
Chandler : We share a wall.
UNK: Either he's great, or she liked to agree with him a lot.
UNK: Loudly and a lot.
UNK: All night long she'd agree.
UNK: It'll be different. The sex will be great because you're in love.
Ross : -Just go for it. -Yeah, you should.
UNK: All right. I'll sleep with my girlfriend.
UNK: But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Joey : Now, the mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic Period.
