UNK: No, no. The puppy is yours.
Phoebe : -I get a puppy? -But for only three days.
UNK: Why?
UNK: I realize I don't have any right to start getting parent-y on you now.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : Look at me and not the puppy. It's very important.
UNK: I know what I'm talking about.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : I gave up two babies.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : I only wish I had someone who'd given up babies that told me...
UNK: Phoebe Sr : ...how terrible it is.
UNK: I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
UNK: That's okay. No, we're listening.
UNK: It'd be something you'd regret every day for the rest of your life.
UNK: So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy...
UNK: ...it'd be a million times harder to give up a child.
UNK: Okay, fair enough. Three days.
UNK: Oh, it's time to take my ass out of the kiln.
