UNK: I can't believe my little brother's married!
UNK: Why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
UNK: Well, we were at court, eating lunch
Phoebe : Why were you at the courthouse?
Frank : We were having lunch.
Frank : We were like...
UNK: ...we're here, we're having lunch. Let's get married! Right?
UNK: A year ago, I didn't know I had a brother. Now I have a sister!
UNK: Oh, it's so great.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Stop it! Don't!
UNK: I'll get you a gift now.
Phoebe : Is there anything you need?
UNK: We've been trying to get pregnant since we got engaged, to get a jump on things.
UNK: No one's getting any younger.
UNK: Because the thing is, we're not able to, you know, conceive.
UNK: We've seen a bunch of doctors.
UNK: They say that our only chance to have a baby...
Frank : ...is that if they take my sperm, her egg, put it together in a dish...
UNK: ...and put it into another girl.
Frank : We were wondering if you could be that girl.
UNK: That's a really nice gift.
UNK: I was thinking of a gravy boat.
UNK: We know it's a lot to ask.
UNK: We don't have anyone else to go to. We could pay someone...
UNK: ...but we don't have that kind of money.
UNK: Plus, you know, you're family and, you know...
UNK: ...I just don't want my baby to grow into some chick I don't know, you know?
UNK: Don't give us an answer yet, think about it.
UNK: And if you say no, we'll totally understand.
Phoebe : Okay. Okay.
UNK: And we were wondering if you could give us a ride down to the train station.
UNK: Well, actually, we kind of need an answer to that one right now.
UNK: The One with Phoebe's Uterus
