UNK: My mom's gonna be here any minute.
UNK: I can't. I can't give him up.
UNK: Yes, no. I can.
UNK: I don't want to.
Joey : But I can.
UNK: No.
UNK: I can't watch this. It's like Sophie's Choice.
UNK: You know, I never saw that.
Rachel : Oh, it was only okay.
UNK: I can't do this.
Phoebe : My mom was right. If I can't give him up...
UNK: ...there's no way I can give up a baby.
UNK: [scene : Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed.
UNK: What else can I give them? A kidney!
UNK: We were in the neighborhood.
UNK: We want to let you know that there's still no pressure.
Alice : If there was something you wanted to say, we'll be right there.
UNK: Who's this little guy?
UNK: He's so cute! He reminds me of my old dog, Tumor.
Alice : You are so precious, I could take you home.
UNK: Why don't you?
Monica : -Are you serious? -Yeah.
UNK: Thanks.
Monica : -What are you doing? -I'm okay with this.
UNK: You know why? Because look at them.
UNK: Look how happy they are.
UNK: And I made that, so you know...
UNK: It'll be a million times harder to give up a baby, but oh, my God!
UNK: It'll feel a million times better, right?
UNK: I'll do this. I want to carry your baby.
Alice : Thank you so much!
UNK: You don't know what this means to us.
UNK: I think I'm going to cry!
UNK: It's going to be so great.
UNK: -What's going on? -I gave them the puppy.
Phoebe : It made them so happy, I decided to carry their baby.
UNK: -Phoebe -No, I know.
UNK: We're different, though.
UNK: This is a different situation.
UNK: I am not going to regret this.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : I understand all that.
UNK: It's just, that was my puppy.
Monica : Would you ever be a surrogate?
UNK: Depends who asked.

UNK: You're not asking me, are you?
UNK: -No. -Yes. Totally.
Kathy : Thank you! Thank you!
Ross : Thank you! Yes, thank you!
