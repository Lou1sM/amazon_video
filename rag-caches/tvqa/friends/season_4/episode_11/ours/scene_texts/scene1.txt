Joey : Check it out! Guess what job I just got.
UNK: I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
UNK: What?
Chandler : Blue blazer back. He wants it back.
UNK: You said "black." Why would he want his blue blazer black?
UNK: Well, you know what I meant.
Monica : You messed it up.
UNK: You're stupid.
Chandler : So, what job did you get?
Joey : Tour guide at the museum. Ross got it for me.
UNK: Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert?
Joey : They give you all the information.
UNK: It's like memorizing a script.
UNK: On your left you have a tyrannosaurus rex, from the Jurassic Period.
UNK: Very nice.
UNK: Yeah, actually, Joey, it's the Cretaceous Period.
Joey : But I can pronounce Jurassic.
Phoebe : Frank Jr. and Alice got married!
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: They're having a baby!
Phoebe : They want me to grow it for them in my uterus!
Phoebe : -My God! -Are you serious?
UNK: You're thinking of having sex with your brother?
UNK: Ew! And, oh, no!
UNK: They want me to be the surrogate.
UNK: It's her egg and his sperm. I'm the oven. It's their bun.
UNK: What did you say?
Phoebe : I had to think about it first, but what is there to think of?
UNK: I'll be giving someone the greatest gift.
UNK: You'll carry their child and get them a Sony PlayStation?
UNK: This is an incredible thing to do.
Rachel : But there are things to think about.
UNK: Yeah, you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant.
Frank : I know.
UNK: You'll put your body through an awful lot.
UNK: I mean, morning sickness, labor.
UNK: It's all for somebody else.
UNK: Yeah. What's your point?
Ross : Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
UNK: I couldn't do that.
Rachel : I always figured the first time I had a baby, it'd be with someone I love.
UNK: And that baby was, you know...
UNK: ...a keeper.
UNK: You were more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Joey : If you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
UNK: Just think it through.
UNK: Talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom.
Phoebe : My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did!
UNK: I love this tushy! Can I take it to work with me?
UNK: Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.
Monica : I am so jealous.
UNK: You guys are just right there.
UNK: Yes.
Chandler : Right where?
Monica : The beginning, where it's all sex and talking...
Monica : ...and sex and talking.
UNK: You got to love the talking.
Monica : -And the sex? -We haven't had sex.
UNK: What's the big deal? This is special.
