UNK: Could you sit there? I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.
UNK: Tour Guide : You mean Dr. Geller?
UNK: Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.
UNK: Oh, he won't sit here.
UNK: Only people in white coats sit there.
UNK: Only people in blue blazers sit here.
Joey : -How come? -That's just the way it is.
UNK: That's crazy.
UNK: Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world : a world without lab coats and blazers.
UNK: Tour Guide : But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now.
UNK: Tour Guide : See that scientist?
UNK: Tour Guide : He and I used to play together in grade school, but now...
UNK: Tour Guide : Peter! Hey, Peter!
UNK: It's me! Rhonda, from P.S. 129?
UNK: I shared my pudding with you, man!
UNK: Tour Guide : I gave you my Snack Pack!
UNK: Tour Guide : See? He pretend he don't even hear me!
UNK: Everyone's pretending they don't hear you.
UNK: I don't know about your jackets and separate tables...
UNK: ...but Ross is my friend.
Joey : And if I save him a seat, he will sit in it.
UNK: Here! I saved you a seat!
UNK: I'm cool here. I'll catch up with you later.
UNK: Tour Guide : This is saved.
UNK: Tour Guide : Gift shop.
UNK: I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
