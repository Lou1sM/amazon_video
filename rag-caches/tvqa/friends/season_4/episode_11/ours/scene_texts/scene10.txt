Ross : ...at this table. Here in the middle.
UNK: I'm having my lunch...
Ross : ...right here with my good friend, Joey.
UNK: If he'll sit with me.
Joey : I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.
Chandler : You know...
Ross : ...we work in a museum of natural history.
Ross : And yet, there is something...
UNK: ...unnatural...
Ross : ...about the way we eat lunch.
UNK: Now, I want you to know...
UNK: ...it took a tour guide to show this scientist the error of his ways.
UNK: You might even say he took me on a tour...
UNK: ...of myself.
UNK: Yeah, that was me.
UNK: I look around, and you know what I see? I see division.
Ross : Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers.
Ross : I ask myself, "My God, why?"
UNK: Now, I say we shed these coats...
Ross : ...that separate us.
Ross : And we get to know the people underneath.
UNK: I'm Ross!
UNK: I'm divorced and I have a kid!
