UNK: Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?
UNK: I think it's time for puppy to go out again.
UNK: Come on, let's go to the balcony.
Phoebe : The street. Come on, let's go to the street.
UNK: Don't go on the balcony until after I get back.
Monica : So did you do it?
Chandler : Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Monica : It was bad?
UNK: It was fine, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as with Joey.
UNK: She was like, "I see your point. I'm all right with it."
UNK: There's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
UNK: Yeah. Not for girls, anyway. Guys agree like that.
Chandler : Look, you have to help me.
Chandler : I mean...
Chandler : I know what to do with a woman. It's always nice.
Chandler : I need to know...
UNK: ...what makes it go from nice to :
UNK: "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
UNK: I'll show you something a lot of guys don't know.
Chandler : All right.
UNK: Now.
UNK: You don't have to draw an actual Whoa, she's hot!
UNK: Everyone knows the erogenous zones.
Monica : You got one, two, three...
UNK: ...four...
Monica : ...five, six and seven.
Chandler : There are seven?
Rachel : Let me see that.
Chandler : Oh, yeah.
UNK: That's one?
Monica : Kind of an important one.
Chandler : I was looking at it upside down.
UNK: Well, you know, sometimes that helps.
UNK: Most guys will hit one, two, three and then go to seven and set up camp.
UNK: That's bad?
UNK: At Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.
UNK: You might if it were like seven.
Monica : All right, the important thing is to take your time.
UNK: You want to hit them all...
UNK: ...mix them up. Keep them on their toes.
UNK: Oh, toes!
Rachel : For some people.
Chandler : All right.
Monica : You could start out with a little one.
UNK: A two.
UNK: A one, two, three.
UNK: A three.
UNK: A five.
UNK: A four.
UNK: A three, two.
UNK: Two. A two, four, six.
UNK: Two, four, six.
UNK: Four. Two.
UNK: Two. Four, seven!
UNK: Five, seven! Six, seven!
UNK: Seven! Seven!
UNK: Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven!
UNK: Seven!
UNK: And there you are.
UNK: Yeah, that'll work.
UNK: Tour Guide : Dr. Geller? There's a seat here.
Ross : Thank you, Dr. Phillips.
UNK: But I'm having my lunch...
