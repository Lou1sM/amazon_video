UNK: I can always find another masseuse.
UNK: Really?
Rick : Yeah, really.
UNK: What?
UNK: Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.
UNK: Quiet down.
UNK: Mr. Simon's been waiting Oh, my God!
UNK: Why wasn't I offered that?
UNK: I'd definitely pay more for that.
UNK: Mrs. Potter : We have rules here. This is not that kind of place.
UNK: I know, but this isn't how it looks at all...
UNK: ...because Rick is my husband.
UNK: Mrs. Potter : Oh, really?
UNK: You'd better tell his other wife.
UNK: Mrs. Potter : She called three times asking where he is.
Phoebe : Yes, I will tell her.
UNK: So you didn't leave the bank?
Ross : And somehow we ended up with a joint checking account.
UNK: What will you ever use that for?
Chandler : To pay for the gym.
Phoebe : So I had a great day.
UNK: Rick and I hit it off. We were making out.
Phoebe : Then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Rachel : -You got fired? -Oh, my gosh!
UNK: It's so weird. I have never been fired from anything.
UNK: Sweetie.
UNK: I started walking around, not knowing what to do next.
Phoebe : I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages.
Phoebe : Then these policemen thought I was a whore too.
UNK: It's really been a bad day, whore-wise.
UNK: Hey, Duck. Is Chick here?
UNK: Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.
Joey : Ready for our last practice?
UNK: We're not getting that spin right because my place is too small.
UNK: -Want to use our place? -No, I had another idea.
Joey : We did it!
UNK: That was incredible!
Rick : That was amazing! We totally nailed it!
UNK: Hey, listen. Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.
UNK: Mrs. Potter : Oh, my God! Look at the time.
UNK: I got to catch the bus to the ball.
Joey : Good luck.
UNK: Unless you want to practice the fox trot. Or the tango?
UNK: Thanks, but no.
UNK: You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
UNK: -Go get them, Treeger. -Right.
UNK: You want to come? Marge has a friend.
UNK: Really?
UNK: You'd dance good with her. She's the same size as me.
UNK: No, I'm good.
UNK: It looks like you've got great experience.
UNK: Let's see. Reason for leaving last job?
Phoebe : They thought I was a whore.
UNK: Okay. We'll give you a call if anything comes up.
Phoebe : Great. Thank you very much.
