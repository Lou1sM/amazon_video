Phoebe : Hey, new wallet?
Chandler : It was time.
Chandler : The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say "cool" anymore.
UNK: Rachel, you just put an empty carton back in the fridge.
Rachel : I know, but the garbage was full.
Monica : Have you ever taken out the trash?
UNK: Since you've lived here?
Rachel : Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Monica : -Third door on the left. -Right!
Rachel : Hey, Mr. Treeger.
UNK: What are you doing?
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: It's a little old but...
UNK: You're clogging up the chute I just unclogged.
UNK: I'm sorry. I don't come in here a lot.
UNK: Of course not. You're a little princess.
UNK: Daddy, buy me a pizza.
UNK: Daddy, buy me a candy factory.
UNK: Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing "Happy Birthday" to me.
UNK: You think you can come here...
UNK: ...make a mess and a big man in coveralls will clean it up?
UNK: Think of someone else for a change.
UNK: Okay, I'm sorry.
UNK: God, if you're going to cry about it!
Joey : Treeger made you cry?
Rachel : He said really mean things that were only partly true.
UNK: I'll teach him a lesson.
UNK: Joey, don't. Let's forget about it.
UNK: That's easy for you to say. You weren't almost just killed!
UNK: All right, that's it. School is in session!
Monica : Is this a gym card?
Chandler : Oh, yeah, gym member.
Chandler : I try to go four times a week, but I've missed...
Chandler : ...the last 1200 times.
UNK: So why don't you quit?
UNK: You don't think I've tried?
UNK: You think I like having $50 a month taken from my account?
Chandler : They make you go all the way down there.
UNK: They use all these phrases and peppiness to confuse you.
UNK: And then they bring out Maria.
Ross : -Who is Maria? -Oh, Maria!
UNK: You can't say no to her.
UNK: She's like this lycra, spandex-covered, gym treat.
UNK: Do you need me to go with you and hold your hand?
UNK: You're strong enough to face her?
UNK: Oh, no. You'll have to come.
