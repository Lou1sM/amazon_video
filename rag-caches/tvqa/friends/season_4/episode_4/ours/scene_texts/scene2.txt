UNK: Now one more time.
UNK: Don't you want a washboard stomach and rock-hard pecs?
Chandler : No, I want a flabby gut and saggy man-breasts.
UNK: That's good.
UNK: I want to quit the gym.
UNK: You want to quit?
UNK: I want to quit the gym.
UNK: You do realize you won't have access to our new Swedish spa?
UNK: I want to quit the gym.
UNK: Gym Employee : Dave in the membership office handles quitters.
UNK: Gym Employee : Excuse me. Are you a member?
UNK: Me?
UNK: Gym Employee : Sorry. Members only.
UNK: I want to quit the gym!
UNK: It's okay, man. Be strong.
UNK: Gym Employee : Are you a member of any gym?
UNK: No, and I'm not going to be. So save your little speech.
UNK: Gym Employee : Okay, no problem.
UNK: Gym Employee : Could you come here?
UNK: Hi, I'm Maria.
Rick : You have really pretty feet.
Phoebe : These old things?
UNK: Would you spend time on my sciatic area? It's killing me.
Phoebe : You mean...
UNK: By sciatic, you mean...
UNK: ...the towel-covered portion?
UNK: Sure, I can do that.
UNK: Because the muscles in the sciatic area can get...
UNK: ...real nice and tight.
UNK: So tell me, Rick, how did you injure the area?
Rick : A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Rick : -Did you just bite me? -No!
UNK: Please don't kick the girls out. This was my fault.
UNK: You want me to kick you guys out instead?
UNK: You can't. Where would the chick and the duck live?
UNK: You have pets?
Joey : Those are nicknames.
UNK: I'm the "chick," and Chandler's the "duck."
UNK: I would've thought it was the other way around.
Joey : Come on. Let the girls stay.
UNK: I'll do whatever you want.
UNK: Really? You'd do anything?
Joey : Yeah, absolutely.
UNK: I got something.
Joey : What is it?
UNK: Can you be my dancing partner?
UNK: That's not prison lingo, is it?
UNK: I want to quit the gym.
UNK: Can you honestly tell me that you're 100% satisfied with your body.
UNK: Yes, yes. Most of the time.
UNK: I mean, sure, I have my bad days, but then I remember what a cute smile I have.
UNK: We were voted "Best-equipped Gym in New York" two years running.
UNK: -Do you really want to give that up? -Yes, I hate it here.
UNK: Everything that you have in here is very heavy.
UNK: Really? Okay?
UNK: You want to make your friend work out alone?
UNK: -What friend? -Your friend Ross. Just joined.
