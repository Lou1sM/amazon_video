Monica : His dancing partner?
UNK: There's this superintendents' dance, "The Super Ball."
Joey : He wants to impress Marge, this lady super he likes.
UNK: Why not practice with a girl?
UNK: He's too shy.
UNK: He's not good enough to dance with girls yet.
Rachel : Yeah, right.
Rachel : He almost danced me right down that garbage chute.
Monica : Would you let it go already? You're fine.
Rachel : So did you quit?
Chandler : I almost did.
UNK: Couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter.
Monica : Wait, now, so you joined the gym?
UNK: And that's funny, why?
UNK: I was just, you know, picturing you working out, and...
UNK: Well, that's it.
UNK: We're doomed.
UNK: They'll take $50 a month from our accounts for the rest of our lives.
Chandler : What are we gonna do?
Monica : You could actually go to the gym.
Ross : Or we could go to the bank...
Ross : ...close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
UNK: You're a genius.
UNK: Oh, man! But then, we won't be bank buddies.

UNK: Next time, try to distract yourself.
UNK: Like when I'm doing something exciting...

UNK: ...excited.
UNK: I try and think of other things. Like sandwiches...
UNK: ...and baseball...
Joey : ...and Chandler.
Chandler : -Thank you. -Oh, no, thank you.
UNK: All right, I'm here. Let's get this over with.
UNK: Okay, well...
UNK: ...just follow my lead.
UNK: Don't we need to do some kind of preparation first?
UNK: Like get really drunk?
UNK: Come on. Hey, just put your arms around me.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: No. It's okay. But if I'm Marge...
Joey : ...my breasts are coming out my back.
UNK: Forget it! I'm not being any good at this.
UNK: My mom was right.
UNK: I'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.
Joey : Come on, man. You're not a potato.
UNK: I'm sure as hell not a dancer. It's no use.
UNK: Marge will never go for me.
Joey : Come on, Treeger. Don't say that.
Joey : You just need more practice.
Joey : Come on. Let's try it again.
UNK: Plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.
