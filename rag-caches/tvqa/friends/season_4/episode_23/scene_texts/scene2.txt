UNK: Chandler, do something!
Joey : -Do something! -I am. I'm ignoring you.
UNK: I'll be the on-camera guy.
Joey : All right. First stop...
Joey : ...Westminster Abbey.
UNK: What is that?
UNK: That's London, baby!
Joey : All right, the hotel's here.
UNK: Wait.
UNK: We want to go
Rachel : I know.
Joey : I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Chandler : If you see a little version of me in there, kill it!
Joey : I got it.
Joey : Here we go!
Chandler : We're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time, are we?
Joey : Man, you made me lose it!
UNK: That was all before 10 : 00.
UNK: The caterer rang. It'll be Chicken Kiev, not Tarragon.
UNK: Then the florist said there are no tulips.
UNK: And the cellist has carpal tunnel syndrome
UNK: Emily, honey. Okay?
Emily : Well, up yours too!
UNK: -What? -Oh, that's not what it means.
UNK: -No! That's "time out." -Sorry.
UNK: Sweetie, relax. Everything will be great, okay?
Ross : Come on, come on.
Emily : Chicken Kiev?
Ross : Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
UNK: Salmon would be more elegant than chicken.
UNK: And you wouldn't worry about the salmonella.
Monica : But of course...
Monica : ...with salmon you would have to worry about the chicknella.
Monica : I can't wait to see where you're getting married.
UNK: It's beautiful. Her parents got married here.
Ross : I can't believe they're tearing it down.
UNK: It's really the most lovely building. It's over
Emily : Oh, my God!
Monica : It's nice.
Emily : Oh, my God!
Emily : What are we going to do?
Ross : Everything's gonna be all right.
Emily : How's it gonna be all right?
Ross : I see that.
UNK: I talked to a guy, and I found out what happened.
UNK: They tore it down early.
