UNK: Mrs. Geller : Sorry we're late.

UNK: Mr. Waltham : Very nice to meet you.
UNK: Darling, the Gellers.
UNK: Mr. Waltham : Darling, it's the Gellers.
UNK: She's very self-involved. I should never have married her.
UNK: Mr. Waltham : -It's the Gellers. -Where?
UNK: That's one and that's another one.
UNK: Mrs. Waltham : Lovely to meet you.
UNK: Mr. Waltham : Nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.

UNK: I miss my family, the coffeehouse.
Joey : I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like!
Chandler : It's been three days.
UNK: Okay, you're just homesick.
Chandler : Would you just try to relax and just enjoy yourself?
UNK: You're different here too.
UNK: You're mean in England!
Chandler : What the hell?
Ross : What's up, Dad?
UNK: Mr. Geller : This bill for my half of the wedding. It's insane.
UNK: How can it be so much? The reception's at their house.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Flowers, liquor. Re-carpet first floor?
UNK: Mr. Geller : New guest bath, landscaping.
UNK: Mr. Geller : I'm paying to remodel this guy's house.
UNK: I'm gonna give that son of a bitch a piece of my mind.
UNK: Please.
Ross : I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight.
Ross : She's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.
UNK: Here. Let me go talk to him.
UNK: Mr. Geller : You tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
UNK: And I'm gonna go get drunk.
UNK: -Hello. -Hello.
Rachel : When is your next flight to London?
UNK: There's one leaving in 30 minutes.
UNK: Ticket Agent : And I do have one seat left.
Rachel : Thank you, thank you.
UNK: The last-minute fare on this ticket is $2700.
Rachel : Huh. How about 600?
UNK: -Sorry. -How about 600 and these earrings?
UNK: Ticket Agent : They prefer it if I don't barter.
UNK: I don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
UNK: You can split it with another card.
Rachel : How about five?
Phoebe : Thank you.
UNK: Ticket Agent : I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Rachel : I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my nightstand.
Ross : You know what? I have my driver's license.
UNK: And I have a 20.
Ross : Face it. My father is not going to pay for the built-in barbecue.
Ross : And believe me, you can kiss your gazebo goodbye.
Ross : I might be able to get you the new lawn.
UNK: Mr. Waltham : Then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
Ross : I go back there with lawn ornaments, he'll laugh in my face.
