UNK: What are you in the market for? Scarves, souvenir postcards...
Joey : Check this out!
Joey : That's the stuff! What do you think?
UNK: I won't need that "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Joey : Well, I like it. Here you go.
UNK: You're not really buying that. Haven't you embarrassed me enough?
Joey : Oh, I embarrass you?
UNK: How can I answer when I'm pretending I don't know you?
UNK: The Vendor : He's just jealous. All Londoners wear them.
Chandler : Really? Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?
UNK: The Vendor : They're all tourists.
Chandler : If you insist on wearing that in public...
UNK: ...you're gonna spend the afternoon all by yourself.
UNK: If you make me choose between you and the hat, I choose the hat.
UNK: The Vendor : -Good choice. -Thanks.
UNK: That's it! I'm out of here. I won't be embarrassed any more.
Chandler : How are you doing? Joey Tribbiani, America.
