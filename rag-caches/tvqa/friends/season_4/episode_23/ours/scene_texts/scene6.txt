UNK: Come on. I'm here to take care of you.
Phoebe : Okay, I have a wedgie.
Rachel : That is all you.
Phoebe : What do you want for lunch?
Rachel : I don't know.
Rachel : I guess we have to eat.
Phoebe : Yeah, I do.
Phoebe : What's the matter?
UNK: I'm bummed the way I left things with Ross.
UNK: I wish I didn't lie about work. He seemed so mad at me.
Phoebe : Don't be so hard on yourself. If I was still in love with some
Phoebe : Still in love with?
Rachel : I'm not in love with Ross.
UNK: Good!
Phoebe : Yeah, me neither.
UNK: I'm not at the wedding, because he's my ex-boyfriend...
UNK: ...and that would be uncomfortable.
UNK: Not because I'm in love with him. I like Ross as much as anyone.
Rachel : Clearly, I have feelings for him, but they don't mean love.
UNK: I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!
Rachel : I have continuing feelings of love.
Rachel : But that doesn't mean I'm still in love with him.
Rachel : I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
Emily : Oh, my God!
Rachel : Why didn't you tell me?
Phoebe : -We thought you knew! -We?
Phoebe : We all know. We talk about it all the time.
Rachel : You all know? Does Ross know?
Phoebe : No! Ross doesn't know anything.
UNK: And you didn't tell me!
Phoebe : We thought you knew. It's so obvious!
UNK: It would be like telling Monica :
Phoebe : "Hey, you like things clean."
UNK: Or, you know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay."
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Oh, please, she's always got a broom in her hand.
