Monica : -Then why would he say it? -Because he's crazy!
Chandler : He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Monica : My mother's right. I'll never get married.
Chandler : You know what, that is
Chandler : Who wouldn't want you?
Monica : Please! I'm a single mom with a 30-year-old son.
Rachel : -Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to -Hello.
Rachel : Hello. I need to get on that 11 : 00 flight.
UNK: I'm afraid that plane's already pulled away from the gate.
Rachel : You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and pick me up.
UNK: Ticket Agent : -Can't do that. -Sure, you know what?
Rachel : We'll just tell them that there was, like, a problem with, like, the engine.
UNK: Ticket Agent : I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, miss.
Rachel : Look, if I don't get to London he is gonna marry that other girl.
UNK: Ticket Agent : Can't imagine why.
Rachel : All right. You know what?
Rachel : I am not leaving here until you call that plane back.
Ross : I'm getting married today!
UNK: Morning.
Ross : -I'm getting married today! -Yeah, you are.
Monica : Do you think he knew I was here?
Ross : -Excuse me. -Yeah.
UNK: If you're going to do that throughout the flight, tell me now...
UNK: ...so that I can take a sedative.
Passenger : Or perhaps slip you one.
Rachel : I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry.
UNK: It's just, I'm kind of excited.
Rachel : I'm going to London...
UNK: ...to tell this guy that I love him.
UNK: Well, I've never done that with you before.
Chandler : So how are you?
Rachel : You okay?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah. You?
UNK: Oh, yes. Yes.
UNK: You?
Chandler : We did you.
UNK: Well...
UNK: -I better get going. -Absolutely.
Monica : Could you not look?
Chandler : I don't want to look.
UNK: Where the hell have you been?
Joey : I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so
UNK: I don't want to hear it!
Joey : Pheebs, you know you're still my number-one girl.
Phoebe : No. No. We have an emergency. Rachel's coming to London.
UNK: Great!
UNK: No, it's not great. She's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Joey : But he loves Emily.
Phoebe : I know that!
Phoebe : You have to stop her. She's going to ruin the wedding.
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : -All right, so -Hold on, hold on.
Joey : Rachel coming.
UNK: Do...
UNK: ...something.
UNK: I've done my part, okay?
Phoebe : It's your responsibility now. The burden is off me.
UNK: -Right? -Right.
Phoebe : So tell me about this girl.
UNK: And so then I realized, all the stuff that I had been doing...
Rachel : ...proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding...
Rachel : -...was all just a way -Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Passenger : I'm sorry, can I interrupt?
UNK: I just want to say that you are a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel : Pardon me?
UNK: You say you love this man, and yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life.
Passenger : I'm afraid I have to agree with your friend Pheebs.
UNK: This is a terrible, terrible plan.
Rachel : -But he has to know how I feel. -But why?
UNK: He loves this Emily person. No good can come of this.
UNK: -Well, I think you're wrong. -Oh, no.
Rachel : Well, he doesn't really love her. It's just a rebound thing from me.
