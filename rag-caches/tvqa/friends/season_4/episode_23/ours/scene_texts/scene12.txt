Housekeeper : This is the housekeeper speaking.
UNK: And, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.
Housekeeper : First one identifies oneself...
Housekeeper : ...and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
Emily : What are you saying?
Housekeeper : Now, let us try that again, shall we?
UNK: No!
Emily : Oh, my God!
Housekeeper : -The Waltham residence. -Hello.
Phoebe : This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please...
Phoebe : ...if it's not too much trouble, please...
UNK: ...might I speak with Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Housekeeper : Miss Waltham is at the rehearsal dinner.
UNK: And it is not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
Phoebe : I'll be nice, I swear. Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Housekeeper : I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
UNK: Somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding, and I have to warn somebody.
Phoebe : So if you don't give me that number, I'm gonna come over there...
UNK: ...and I'm gonna kick your snooty ass all the way to New Gloukenshire!
Emily : Hello? Hello?
Phoebe : She knew I could kick her ass.
UNK: -Hi, sweetheart. -Mom, Dad.
