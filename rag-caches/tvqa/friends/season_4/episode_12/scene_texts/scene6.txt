Rachel : It has something to do with numbers!
Monica : -And processing! -He carries a briefcase.
UNK: Ten seconds. You need this or you lose.
Rachel : Something to do with transponding.
UNK: He's a transponster!
UNK: That's not even a word!
Monica : I can get this! I can get this!
UNK: -I call Monica's room. -You can't just call Monica's room.
Joey : Sure I can. Standard shotgun rules.
UNK: I'm in sight of the room and I called it.
UNK: Damn!
UNK: I feel like I'm coming down with something.
UNK: Guess the color of my tonsils. I bet the apartment!
UNK: I would never bet this place. It's too nice.
Joey : Are they in there?
UNK: Yeah, I'm implanted.
Monica : -How do you feel? -Well, freaked.
UNK: It turns out the odds are really sucky.
Phoebe : And this is Frank and Alice's only shot.
Phoebe : They are literally putting all their eggs in my basket.
Chandler : But I bet it works.
Monica : Really? How much?
UNK: I'm going to take a pregnancy test now.
Joey : Wow! You can tell this soon?
UNK: The doctor says it takes a few days.
UNK: But my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
UNK: I can't believe you guys think you're moving in here.
Chandler : Well, believe it, baby!
UNK: -Well, I'm not moving. -What?
Rachel : No. It was a stupid bet. We were just playing a game.
UNK: You can't ignore the bet. It's a bet!
UNK: Bet on a bet and if you lose, you lose the bet.
Monica : We have to move.
UNK: We would have made them get rid of the birds.
Monica : I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better...
UNK: ...this is all your fault.
UNK: What?
UNK: Chanandler Bong! We steal that TV Guide every week!
Phoebe : I knew it!
UNK: I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.
Chandler : Cool! Girl roommate.
UNK: Well?
Phoebe : Nope, not knocked up yet.
UNK: It's only been a couple hours.
UNK: Meanwhile, I'll do whatever I can to help this.
UNK: I'm just going to, you know, lie in your chair, okay?
UNK: Good. I'm going to let gravity do its job.
UNK: I won't get in the way.
UNK: It'll be just like that time I tried to count all the bumps on your ceiling.
UNK: You know, Pheebs, if you sit there long enough, you'll be sitting in our apartment.
UNK: I can't believe this.
UNK: Oh, Rach, FYl : Your new apartment hasn't had hot water since Christmas.
Monica : Can you give me a hand?
Rachel : Put that box down! We are not going anywhere!
Rachel : This is my apartment and I like it!
UNK: This is a girl's apartment!
UNK: That is a boy's apartment! It's dirty and it smells!
Rachel : This is pretty! It's so pretty!
UNK: And look, it's purple!
UNK: I tell you, you with your steady hand, I am not moving.
