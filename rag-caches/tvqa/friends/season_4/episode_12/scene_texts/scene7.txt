Rachel : And now I have got the steady hand.
Joey : Okay, okay.
UNK: -I'll take care of it. -That's right.
Rachel : You do what the hand says!
UNK: -How'd it go? -I lost our mattresses.
Phoebe : Are you in there, little fetus? In nine months will you come greet us?
Phoebe : I will buy you some Adidas
Alice : We were just at the drugstore so we got you a little present.
UNK: That's where all my blood was.
UNK: It's a lollipop and a home pregnancy test.
UNK: Don't mix those up. You could really ruin that lollipop.
Alice : You feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
Phoebe : All right. I will.
Phoebe : Remember that it's still really early.
UNK: If it says I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.
UNK: Just so I don't go completely nuts...
UNK: ...try not to put all your hopes on this.
UNK: Great.
Rachel : You are mean boys who are just being mean!
UNK: Don't get mad! No one forced you to raise the stakes.
Rachel : That is not true! She forced me!
UNK: You got the question wrong.
UNK: It was a stupid, unfair question!
UNK: Don't blame the questions!
Chandler : Stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us.
Rachel : -Stop calling it your apartment! -It is!
UNK: You're going to have a baby. They're going to have a baby!
UNK: My sister's going to have my baby!
UNK: Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
UNK: I can't find garbage bags.
Rachel : I think I saw some in here.
Monica : What is it?
UNK: I don't know. But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
UNK: I can't believe we're living here!
Monica : What is it?
Joey : Did you see the size of the closets?
UNK: I can't believe we live here!
