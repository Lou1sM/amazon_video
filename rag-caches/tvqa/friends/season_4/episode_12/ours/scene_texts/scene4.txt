Ross : Somebody call it this time.
UNK: Tails!
UNK: It's heads.
Ross : Gentlemen, pick your category.
UNK: "Fears and Pet Peeves."
UNK: "What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"
Joey : -Animals dressed as humans. -Correct.
UNK: -Ladies? -Same category.
UNK: "According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejesus out of him?"
Monica : Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
Ross : That is correct.
UNK: The Irish jig guy?
Chandler : His legs flail about as if independent from his body!
UNK: Gentlemen, your pick.
UNK: "It's all Relative."
UNK: "Monica and I had a grandmother who died.
Ross : You both went to her funeral.
UNK: Name that grandmother."
UNK: -Nana? -She has a real name.
UNK: Althea!
UNK: -What? -I took a shot!

Ross : -Althea is correct. -Nice shooting!
UNK: "Literature."
UNK: "Every week the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment.
Ross : What name appears on the address label?"
Rachel : Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
UNK: I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to "Chanandler Bong."
Monica : I knew that!
UNK: Rachel, use your head!
UNK: Actually, it's Ms. Chanandler Bong.
UNK: Hello, teeny embryos.
UNK: I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!
UNK: I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.
UNK: We're doing this for Frank and Alice...
Phoebe : ...who you know. You've been there.
Phoebe : They want you so much.
Phoebe : So when you guys get in there, really grab on.
UNK: And I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm...
UNK: ...until you're ready to have them take you home.
Phoebe : Next time you see me, if I'm screaming, don't worry.
UNK: That's what's supposed to happen.
UNK: Ready?
All : Good luck!
Ross : The score is nine to eight in favor of the guys.
Ross : Ladies, if you miss this, the game is theirs. Pick a category.
UNK: "It's all Relative"!
UNK: -You don't have to shout everything. -I'm sorry!
UNK: "What is the name of Chandler's father's...
UNK: ...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"
Monica : Viva Las Gaygas!
Chandler : Unfortunately, that is correct.
Ross : All right. We have a tie.
UNK: Luckily, I've prepared for such an event.
Ross : The lightning round!
Ross : Thirty seconds. All the questions you can answer.
Monica : You guys are dead!
UNK: I am so good at lightning rounds!
Chandler : I majored in lightning rounds, all right?
UNK: We'll destroy you.
UNK: Want to bet?
UNK: I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far.
