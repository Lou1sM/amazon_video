UNK: Dr. Zane : Looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Phoebe : I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
UNK: Okay, so what's now? Go get the eggs. Put them in there.
UNK: It'll take a little while to prepare the embryos.
UNK: -Embryos? As in more than one? -Five, actually.
Phoebe : Where am I giving birth...
UNK: ...in a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
UNK: Doing five gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
UNK: That's it? 25%?
UNK: That means that it's, like, 75% chance of no baby at all?
Frank : I was thinking, what are the odds...
UNK: ...if you stuff 200 of them in there?
UNK: Sweetie, now...
UNK: ...she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
UNK: Don't worry. I'll do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
UNK: The thing is, we kind of only have one shot.
Alice : It costs $16,000 each time you do this.
UNK: Sixteen thousand dollars?!
UNK: Well, it's 20 in California.
UNK: We're kind of using all the money we have to do it this one time.
UNK: Okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.
UNK: Maybe there's something I can do to make sure I get pregnant.
UNK: No, I'm sorry.
Phoebe : Wow, you guys really don't know anything.
UNK: Why don't you get drunk? It worked for a bunch of girls in my high school.
