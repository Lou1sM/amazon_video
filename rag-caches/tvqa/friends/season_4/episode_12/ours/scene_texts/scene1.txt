UNK: ...thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
UNK: You should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be in an apartment.
UNK: Especially not with these knives and cookbooks around.
UNK: I'm going to the doctor and see if I'm ready...
UNK: ...to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Ross : How will they know?
UNK: They'll just see if my endometrial layer is thick.
UNK: I can check that for you.
UNK: Okay, think "thick."
All : Good luck!
Phoebe : Wish me luck.
All : Good luck.
UNK: -I'm still right. -That is so not true.
UNK: What?
UNK: I know it's her laundry day...
UNK: ...and that means she's wearing her old-lady underpants.
UNK: I can check that for you.
UNK: You two think you know me and Rachel...
Monica : ...better than we know you.
UNK: Well, we do.
UNK: You can only eat Tic Tacs in even numbers.
UNK: What's that about?
Chandler : And you! Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...
Chandler : ...you'll find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
UNK: You're good.
Ross : These are not.
UNK: I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Joey : Ross, how many items left in that bag?
UNK: Five.
UNK: Okay, 10 bucks says we can name every item in that bag.
Rachel : -How many guesses? -Six.
Ross : Challenge extended.
UNK: -Deal! -Challenge accepted.
UNK: All right, we'll start with...
UNK: ...apples.
UNK: We'll be starting with apples.
Chandler : Stop that now.
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Okay. Tortilla chips.
UNK: -Yogurt. -Diet soda.
Chandler : -Orange juice. -There's no orange juice! We win!
Ross : They have another guess.
Rachel : Well, we won that one.
UNK: Okay. The last thing is
UNK: Not for another two weeks.
Chandler : I got it.
UNK: Scotch...
UNK: ...tape.
Ross : How did you know she would buy Scotch tape?
UNK: We used up theirs last night making scary faces.
UNK: Oh, man!
UNK: All right! Ten bucks. Fork it over.
Chandler : Cough it up. Pay the piper.
UNK: Give me it!
UNK: You don't know us better. I want a rematch.
UNK: And no stupid grocery questions. Real, personal questions.
UNK: And the winner gets $100.
UNK: -Serious? -Are you scared?
UNK: No.
Joey : Who makes up the questions?
Monica : Ross will do it.
UNK: Sure, Ross will do it.
UNK: It's not like he has a job or a child or a life of his own.
UNK: -Fine. We'll ask Phoebe. -No, I want to play.
