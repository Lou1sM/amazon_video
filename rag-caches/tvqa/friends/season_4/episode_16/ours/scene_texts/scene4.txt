Rachel : Ready. Okay.
UNK: Give me an "E"!
UNK: Give me an "M"!
UNK: Give me an "I"!
UNK: Give me an "L"!
UNK: Give me a "Y"!
Rachel : What do you get?
UNK: Emily! Emily!
UNK: That's me as a cheerleader!
UNK: I loosened a tooth. It's no big deal. I have a dentist.
UNK: I'll put some ice on it. Excuse me.
Rachel : -What do I do now? -I think you're done.
Joey : Time to take off the bra.
Joshua : That was really great.
UNK: But I gotta take off.
Joey : Take the bra off.
UNK: Let's go get your coat.
UNK: Rachel's my girlfriend.
Joshua : So this was really fun.
UNK: Yeah, it was real fun.
UNK: You know, this bra...
UNK: ...is really bothering me.
Rachel : This used to be my bedroom.
Rachel : A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.
Rachel : If these walls could talk, they'd say :
UNK: "Want to hear some memories?"
UNK: Need a hand?
Rachel : I got this all under control.
UNK: You really don't seem like you do.
UNK: God! Forget it!
Rachel : This is not how this was supposed to happen.
Joshua : What was supposed to happen?
Rachel : Can you not look at me when I say this?
Rachel : I thought that if I could get you here...
Rachel : ...I could seduce you.
Rachel : -Excuse me? -Seduce you.
UNK: I don't wear suits to work.
Joshua : And I bought six of them from you.
UNK: I'm sorry. I thought you needed them.
UNK: My point is, I kept coming back because I wanted to see you.
UNK: -Why? -Because I like you.
Rachel : You like me?
UNK: I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.
UNK: A lot of this isn't based on tonight.
UNK: But you like me?
UNK: I can't believe this. All this time, I liked you and you liked me!
UNK: -But -No "but."
UNK: "But" is never good. Let's leave it at "I like you and you like me."
Joshua : -Okay. However -No, that's a fancy "but."
Joshua : My marriage, like, just ended.
UNK: And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
