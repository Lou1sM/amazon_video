UNK: Cereal killer.
UNK: Cereal killer?
UNK: Hey, come on, I say more dumb things before 9 a.m...
UNK: ...than most people say all day.
UNK: What?
UNK: I can't find anything that I wanna eat. Everything makes me nauseous.
UNK: I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake. Oh, cake!
UNK: No.
UNK: Honey, I'm sorry.
Phoebe : What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom.
Chandler : Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
UNK: It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen, there's something in here I want to eat.
Phoebe : What smells so good?
UNK: -Is it the shampoo? It's guava. -No.
UNK: Wait.
Joey : Is it my bologna sandwich?
Phoebe : Yes. Yes. Yes.
UNK: I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna. The baby wants meat. I can't eat meat.
UNK: Wait!
UNK: Maybe it's the pickle!
UNK: The One With the Fake Party
Chandler : What are you writing?
UNK: Joshua's coming in tomorrow, and since I don't have the guts to ask him out...
UNK: ...I'm gonna sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
UNK: "Joshua, give me a call sometime. Guys like you...
UNK: ...never go out of style."
Chandler : What did you throw away?
Chandler : -Hi, guys. -What have you guys been up to?
Ross : We went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs at the museum.
Chandler : Without me?
Emily : My uncle dragged us there, but it turned out to be really interesting.
Emily : They were so ornate and beautiful. Look at that.
UNK: I don't know how museums work in England, but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
Emily : I got it from the gift shop.
Emily : They have really lax security there.
UNK: It's a joke.
UNK: Anyone for more tea?
UNK: No, just me then.
UNK: Hey, Ringo.
UNK: Every time Emily's around, you talk like her. Would you please cut it out?
UNK: I think you like it.
UNK: I think you can't resist me when I do it.
UNK: You want to eat me up like a cream "pumpy."
UNK: -What? -All right, look, I don't know all the words.
UNK: Right. I've got to be off. I'll see you. Bye-bye, then.
UNK: Bye-bye, then.
Joey : You guys seem to be having a good time.
UNK: She is amazing, and she's so much fun.
UNK: And you know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun!
UNK: I do things like run off to Vermont...
UNK: ...and you guys saw the doorknob.
Ross : I even signed up for helicopter classes.
UNK: She's leaving in two days. I don't have to do it.
Ross : Two days? You must be bummed.
UNK: She's got to go back to London, but I've been prepared for this from the start.
Ross : We both knew we had two weeks together, and then that's it.
UNK: Hey, that's what all my relationships are like.
UNK: Yes, but in Ross' case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
UNK: -Pheebs! -Hello. Hello.
UNK: No, I know. Yeah.
