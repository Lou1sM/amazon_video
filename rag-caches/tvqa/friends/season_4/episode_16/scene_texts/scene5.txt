UNK: But...
UNK: I'm sorry. I just need a little time.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: There you are. I was looking for you.
UNK: Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.
UNK: It's okay.
UNK: She's still in there enjoying her fake party.
UNK: It's too late to do the stuff I had planned.
UNK: I'm sorry. I ruined your evening.
UNK: Yeah.
Rachel : If it makes you feel any better, I made a fool of myself.
Ross : Helps a little.
Rachel : Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Ross : Have a seat.
UNK: -I'm so sorry. -It's okay.
UNK: It was just a two-week thing anyway.
UNK: I just didn't want it to end this way.
UNK: Or maybe you didn't want it to end.
Ross : What do you mean?
Rachel : You seem to really like her.
Ross : I really do.
UNK: But what am I going to do? We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
Ross : No commitment.
Rachel : That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
Rachel : ...asking to hear stories about you...
Rachel : ...looking through Monica's photo albums.
UNK: You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Ross : You think?
UNK: You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
UNK: And you're sitting here in a hallway...
Rachel : ...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
UNK: You're right.
UNK: Thanks.
Ross : What photo album was it?
UNK: I don't know. It was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Ross : Oh, my God! Those weren't albino kids.
Ross : That was computer camp!
UNK: -You're a pathetic loser, right? -Oh, yeah.
UNK: Sit!
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Oh, my God. Joshua.
UNK: Look...
Joshua : ...all those things I said about not being ready
UNK: -They're not true? -They're all true.
UNK: But...
UNK: I love that "but."
UNK: Do you want to go inside and get some coffee?
UNK: Okay.
Rachel : Every time.
UNK: -What do you got there? -Pastrami.
UNK: -You know what goes good with that? -Corned beef.
UNK: I was going to say bologna. But that's better.
UNK: -How about that smoked turkey? -Okay.
Joey : Oh, mama!
Joey : -When is the baby due? -Six months.
UNK: If a cow died of natural causes, I could have one of those, right?
Phoebe : Not if I get there first.
