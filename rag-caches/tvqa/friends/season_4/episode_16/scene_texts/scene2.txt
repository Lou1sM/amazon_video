UNK: What's so funny?
Chandler : I said, "Like what?"
UNK: Now that's a thinker.
UNK: This playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.
Rachel : Hand me those cherries.
Rachel : -Care for a cherry? -No, thanks.
Rachel : I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Joshua : You okay?
Joshua : You all right?
Ross : We should probably get going soon.
UNK: But the party's just getting started.
Ross : We have to be at The Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes.
Ross : Then The Plaza for dinner.
Emily : So why did you plan a party at the same time?
UNK: Give me a hand with the zipper.
UNK: Up!
Monica : -You changed? -I decided I needed my lucky dress.
Monica : -Lucky means more cleavage? -It does for me.
Rachel : Look at him! He's so cute.
UNK: I just want to grab him and kiss him.
UNK: How could I kiss him without him knowing I like him?
Joey : I know how you can get him. Take off your bra.
UNK: What?
UNK: -This scene in Footloose -Flashdance.
UNK: -Yeah. With that plumber girl? -A welder.
Joey : Were you, like, in the movie?
UNK: She takes off her bra under the shirt and pulls it out the sleeve.
Joey : Very sexy. And classy.
UNK: -Or you could use mistletoe. -It's not Christmas.
UNK: -Spin-the-bottle. -He's not 11.
Emily : Thank you so much for this. It was so thoughtful of you.
UNK: You're leaving?
Ross : -We have something we have to get to. -I'm gonna take off too.
UNK: You can't leave yet. You have to stay.
UNK: We've got the whole big thing planned.
Ross : What big thing?
UNK: Spin-the-bottle works like this : I spin the bottle.
UNK: Lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther.
Ross : All right.
UNK: Who wants to go first?
UNK: I'll go.
Joey : Welcome to America.
Ross : Oh, my God!
Monica : Two in a row! You gotta use your tongues now.
Ross : All right.
Chandler : What are the odds?
UNK: That's enough!
UNK: Let's let someone else play.
UNK: If you didn't want to play, then why'd you come to the party?
UNK: All right, I'll go.
UNK: Somebody loose. Somebody loose.
UNK: Story of my life.
UNK: Story of my father's life.
