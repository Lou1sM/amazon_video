UNK: He has a name. It's Dragon.
UNK: You want to know your name? Check your hat.
UNK: The Waiter : We did the hat, right?
UNK: -What the hell just happened? -I am so sorry.
UNK: I was going to do it.
Joey : But I was standing there with $327 in one hand...
UNK: ...and $238 in the other. And I was thinking...
UNK: ...it's been a long time since I had...
UNK: ...$327 plus $238!
UNK: We had a deal! It's why you're here. I've got to fire you!
UNK: And I got to pay rent!
UNK: How about you don't fire me.
Joey : Instead, I stay. I gain their trust.
UNK: They'll listen to the nice things I say about you.
UNK: What nice things?
UNK: Nothing yet. They hate you, and I want to fit in.
UNK: Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica Merry, merry

UNK: What was Phoebe's song about?
UNK: It's the one with the cat.
UNK: I got to go. I've got another date.
Phoebe : Did you pick one yet?
UNK: It turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.
Ross : It was a different joke. It wasn't that funny.
UNK: So I'm still torn.
UNK: You don't like the one from uptown.
UNK: And you're exhausted from dating Poughkeepsie.
Phoebe : Just end them both!
UNK: Go to Poughkeepsie and break up with her.
UNK: Then break up with uptown.
Phoebe : By the time you get home, you're done!
UNK: You're right. Thank you.

UNK: -Prague? -So much you don't know.
Rachel : Patrick just ended things with me.
UNK: Did you or didn't you tell him I wanted a serious relationship?
Chandler : I did! I absolutely did!
Rachel : You idiot!
UNK: I'm sure you're right. But why?
UNK: You don't tell a guy that you want a serious relationship.
Rachel : Now you scared him away!
UNK: I am sorry. I am so sorry.
Rachel : You should never be allowed to talk to people!
Chandler : I know, I know!
UNK: Now I'm right back where I started.
Rachel : This sucks!
Rachel : Being alone sucks!
UNK: You'll meet somebody.
UNK: You're a great catch!
UNK: When I told those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
UNK: Really?
UNK: You graduated magna cum laude, right?
UNK: It doesn't matter.
UNK: I got tickets to the Ranger game. You want to come with me?
Rachel : Cute guys in little shorts?

Rachel : That sounds fun too. Thank you.
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : Have you ever been with a woman?
UNK: What? What is the matter with you?

UNK: The Woman From Poughkeepsie : Wake up!
Monica : I need more swordfish.
UNK: -Can you get me more swordfish? -I don't speak English.
