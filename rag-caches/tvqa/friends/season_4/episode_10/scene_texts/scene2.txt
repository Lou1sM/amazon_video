Chandler : I say, Drew? Are you seeing anybody right now?
UNK: I'm not asking for me.
UNK: I'm not gay. I'm not asking you out.
UNK: I'm not gay.
UNK: I didn't think you were gay.
Drew : I do now.
Chandler : My friend, Rachel, wants to be set up.
Drew : I just got out of a big relationship.
UNK: I'm not looking to get serious.
UNK: That's okay. A fling might be all right with her.
UNK: Is this "Hot Rachel" that you took to the Christmas Party?
Chandler : By the way, that is her full name.
UNK: Wow! I'm free for her.
UNK: Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.
UNK: Let's talk it over at the Ranger game.
Drew : Hold on. I just got a box of Cubans.
UNK: I'll bring them by your office at five.
UNK: That's a little later than I usually stay, but sure.
Mike : Before the game, we could enjoy some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.
UNK: I don't know what that is, but that's a pretty nice jacket.
UNK: Kind of like that tie too.
UNK: Keep your pants on, man.
UNK: I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
UNK: Happy Hanukkah, Monica
Phoebe : May your Christmas be snowy, Joey
Phoebe : Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross
UNK: Spin the dreidel, Rachel
UNK: Pheebs, that's great!
UNK: But you know, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
UNK: I know, but it's so hard. Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Joey : What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel :
UNK: Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
UNK: Maypole.
Phoebe : All good. Thanks.
Phoebe : Do you, maybe, have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
UNK: Didn't your dad used to call you "Pumpkin"?
UNK: Pumpkin? But did he ever call you "Budolph"?
Chandler : Hello, children.
Chandler : Have I got the 50 guys for you!
UNK: -Really? -I showed them your picture.
Chandler : Guys are throwing themselves at me and giving me stuff.
Chandler : -Knicks tonight? -Where are the seats?
UNK: Wherever! I've got 20.
Rachel : Will I like any of these guys?
UNK: You know, I'm going to...
UNK: ...play the field a little bit more.
Chandler : Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me.
Phoebe : You work with robots?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: One guy, Patrick, you'll like him. He's nice, funny and a swimmer.
UNK: I like swimmers' bodies.
UNK: His dad made the magnetic strip on credit cards.
Rachel : I like credit cards!
UNK: I'm not bad at this!
Rachel : -What does he do? -He works in fine foods.
UNK: -You have a fine foods division? -It's a big company...
Joey : Now, wait a second. You make food and robots?
Phoebe : No, the robots just work for them.
UNK: All right, I'm going to work.
Monica : Does anybody have a problem with that?
Joey : Yeah, lady. I do!
Joey : I got a problem!
UNK: I'll give you a problem!
UNK: What will you do? Fire me?
UNK: You bet your ass I'll fire you!
UNK: -See you later. -Thanks.
