UNK: I should go. I've got a date.
Chandler : With who?
UNK: You know the girl who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Ross : Not her.
Ross : This is someone else.
UNK: I can't decide between the two.
UNK: The one from Poughkeepsie, though two hours away, is pretty...
UNK: ...really smart and a lot of fun.
Ross : But this other girl, she lives right uptown.
UNK: She's just as pretty.
UNK: I guess she's smart.
UNK: She's not fun.
UNK: If she's no fun, why date her at all?
UNK: I want to give her a chance. She lives so close.
Ross : And, at the end of the date, she said something that...
Ross : ...if she was kidding, was very funny.
UNK: If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun. She's stupid and racist.
Phoebe : How was your first day at the restaurant?
UNK: Damn!
