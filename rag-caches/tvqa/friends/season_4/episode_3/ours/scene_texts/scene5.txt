Phoebe : Who cares what your mom thinks?
UNK: So you "pulled a Monica."
UNK: I'm glad that's catching on.
Phoebe : Why does that have to be a bad thing? Just change what it means.

UNK: What?
UNK: If a kid gets straight A's, his parents say, "You pulled a Monica."
Phoebe : A fireman saves a baby, and they go, "He pulled a Monica."

UNK: She's very private about her office!
Rachel : Now I know why!
UNK: You're in trouble either way.

UNK: That works out to just 50 bucks a book.
UNK: $1200?
Joey : You think I have $1200?
UNK: I'm home during the day...
Joey : ...and I got patio furniture in my living room.
UNK: There's a few things you don't get from book learning.
UNK: Well, what can you swing?
Joey : How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
UNK: You don't have anything?
UNK: You want to see what I got?
UNK: I got a baby Tootsie Roll...
Joey : ...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

UNK: For $50 you can get one book.
UNK: The Salesman : What will it be? A? B? C?
UNK: I'll stick with the V.
UNK: I want to see how this bad boy turns out.
UNK: I will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts!
UNK: I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Chandler : -With extra pulp? -Yeah.
UNK: I've got it!
UNK: You don't have it.
Rachel : I have so got it!
