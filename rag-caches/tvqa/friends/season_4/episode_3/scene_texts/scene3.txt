UNK: That's weird. She locked the door.
UNK: You know why? She's got the bonus list in there.
UNK: I saw her working on it today.
UNK: Swear you won't tell.
Rachel : When Mark left, he gave me a key to her office.
UNK: You want to see the list?
Chandler : How are you?
Chandler : Hello, Joanna
UNK: office.
UNK: I'm sorry. I'll be a little longer.
Chandler : -How little? -A couple hours.
UNK: This isn't funny. Get back here now!
UNK: -I can't! -Why not?
UNK: I'm in my boss' car.
UNK: -What? -Tunnel!
UNK: What?
Chandler : Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
UNK: Okay, here's the situation.
Chandler : The keys to the cuffs are on the door.
Chandler : Could you be a doll...
Chandler : ...and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me?
UNK: And on a totally separate subject, that's a lovely pantsuit.
Rachel : You promised you would break up with her.
Chandler : I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
UNK: Jeopardizing my career never entered your mind?
Chandler : It did enter my mind.
Chandler : But then something happened that made it shoot right out.
Rachel : You got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out.
UNK: I can't get myself right out of them.
Chandler : You must have me confused with the "Amazing Chandler"!
Chandler : Unlock me! She could be gone for hours, and I'm cold and...
Rachel : All right! This is it!
UNK: Never see her again.
UNK: Never!
UNK: -Never come in here again. -Fine!
Rachel : Give me back my Walkman!
UNK: I never borrowed it.
Rachel : Then I lost it. Buy me one!
Chandler : You got it! Here we go! Come on. This is great!
Rachel : Does it hurt?
UNK: No, I always see guys do this when handcuffs are taken off.
Chandler : Hello, sweet pants!
UNK: Wait! What will you tell Joanna?
Chandler : About what?
UNK: She'll see you're gone and know I let you out, and I'll get fired!
UNK: I'll tell a lie! I'm good at lying!
Chandler : I actually did borrow your Walkman!
UNK: She'll know I have a key to her office.
UNK: I've got to lock you back up.
UNK: I don't think so.
Chandler : This is much better.
