Ross : -It's endearing, really. -All right!
Joey : Now you go get that beautiful pig!
Chandler : I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present...
Chandler : ...for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Rachel : Any luck?
Chandler : Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible Things for Kathy."
Chandler : Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Rachel : Just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen...
UNK: ...and you get her something worse than that...
Rachel : ...like a regular pen.
Chandler : She's really going to love this, you know?
Chandler : The bottom line is, I want her to have it...
Chandler : ...even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Rachel : Honey, that's so sweet.
Chandler : You don't think it's just pathetic?
UNK: Oh, "pathetic"!
Joey : I've been looking all over for you.
UNK: -Where? -Our place. The hall.
Chandler : I got something for her.
Chandler : It's a book.
Chandler : A book?
UNK: Is it a book that's also a safe?
Chandler : It's a book that's just a book.
UNK: It's the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite as a kid.
Chandler : So just let me know if she likes it, okay?
UNK: You got it. Thanks for doing this. I owe you one.
Joey : There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
Chandler : No, it came out to an even twenty.
Joey : Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Phoebe : -You didn't get the money? -Maybe I can try at intermission?
Rachel : You know what? Let's just go.
UNK: We're not leaving till we get paid!
Monica : I don't know who she thinks she is.
UNK: I talked to the florist. She didn't get paid either.
UNK: Or the limo driver, or the priest, and he can get the dead guy damned for all eternity.
UNK: Well, I'm not going back out there.
UNK: Fine. Enough is enough!
Phoebe : Hey, widow?
UNK: Widow?
Phoebe : Excuse me? Excuse me!
Phoebe : Thanks. Clearly this is a very, very hard time for you.
Phoebe : But we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid...
Phoebe : ...because you ate that service.
Phoebe : We are not leaving here until we are paid every penny, because...
UNK: ...we're part-time caterers and we have no place else to go.
UNK: Mrs. Burkart : All right. I'll get my bag.
UNK: Good.
UNK: I'm going to leave some cards here.
Monica : Please think of us for your next event.
Cheryl : So you want to come inside?
UNK: Yes.
Ross : Yes, I do.
Cheryl : I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Cheryl : Guess who?
Ross : Department of Sanitation?
Cheryl : It's me.
