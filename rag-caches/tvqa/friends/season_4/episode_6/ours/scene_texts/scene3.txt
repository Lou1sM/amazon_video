UNK: See you in hell.
Rachel : You know what we should all do?
Rachel : Go see a musical.
UNK: Sure.
Rachel : You know which one?
Rachel : The 1996 Tony Award winner.
UNK: I mean, that one's gotta be good.
UNK: Do you know the name of that one?
Chandler : I don't know. Grease?
UNK: Rent?
Rachel : Yes! Rent!
Chandler : So when do you want to go?
UNK: What? I'm sorry. I can't, I'm busy.
Joey : Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Chandler : Yes, it is...
Chandler : ...at Office Max!
Rachel : What did you get her?
Rachel : A pen.
Joey : It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock.
Chandler : -You can't give her that. -Why not?
UNK: She's not 11!
Chandler : And it's not the seventh night of Chanukah.
Rachel : What he means by that is, while this is a very nice gift...
UNK: ...maybe it's not something a boyfriend gives.
Joey : Sure it is.
Joey : She needs a pen for work.
Joey : She's writing. She turns it over. "It's time for my date with Joey!"
UNK: All right. What did you get for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?
UNK: She didn't have one.
Chandler : For three years?
Joey : Look, it's too late, and I got an audition.
Joey : I can't shop anymore.
Chandler : I will go out and try to find something for her.
Joey : Thanks, man.
Joey : While you're at it, could you get her a card?
Chandler : Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Joey : Or just get a card that has a poem already in it.
UNK: Oh, so it's a card, but it's also a poem-holder.
Phoebe : -You have to get our money. -She couldn't stop crying.
Monica : With those thick glasses, her tears look giant.
Phoebe : I know, it's tough.
Phoebe : You know what the first thing I did after my mom's funeral was?
UNK: -What? -Pay the caterer!
Phoebe : I've had a lot of jobs.
Phoebe : And there are some people who always try to get out of paying.
UNK: It's either "That massage wasn't long enough"...
UNK: ...or "I don't know any of those songs"...
UNK: ...or "These sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
UNK: So you think she's faking?
Phoebe : There weren't any tears till you showed her the bill.
Monica : She sounded pretty upset to me.
Phoebe : She seems fine now.
Joey : So you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Ross : You throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day.
Ross : Like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.
Ross : And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.
Ross : And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time...
Ross : ...and garbage is all that has survived.
UNK: -Here. -Wow. Thanks.
Joey : So what happened?
UNK: Nothing. I had to get out of there.
Joey : Next time, you take her to your place.
Ross : I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Joey : -What kind of smell? -I don't know. Soap?
UNK: -Listen, you like this girl, right? -Yeah.
UNK: -You want to see her again? -Yeah.
UNK: So you're going to have to do it in the mess!
Ross : Yeah, okay. You're right.
UNK: I mean, who cares about a little sloppiness?
