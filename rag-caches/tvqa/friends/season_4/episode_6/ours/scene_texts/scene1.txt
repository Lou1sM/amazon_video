Kathy : Yes, I can, of course.
Chandler : It's okay. The duck's using our bathroom anyway.
Chandler : What are you getting for her birthday?
UNK: We've been dating a couple weeks. I got to get her something?
Rachel : You have to get her something really nice.
Ross : -I know! -And not one of your coupons...
Rachel : ...for an hour of "Joey Love."
Phoebe : -A crossword! Can I help? -No.
Rachel : Last week I got all but three answers...
UNK: ...and I want to finish one without any help.
UNK: Fine.
Phoebe : But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Rachel : How'd it go?
Rachel : Oh, my God! It was the best funeral ever!
Monica : Everyone loved the food.
Monica : I even got another funeral for tomorrow.
UNK: The dead guy from today's best friend.
UNK: It's like I am the official caterer for that accident.
Phoebe : Mon, I'm so happy for you!
UNK: Thanks. Check out my new catering stuff.
UNK: Look! I'm an omelet station!
Monica : Omelet? Made to order?
Phoebe : I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Monica : I didn't realize you needed it right away.
Monica : You told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I be'd.
Monica : I used it to buy all this stuff.
UNK: Aborigine.
UNK: I got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back then.
UNK: Okay. Sorry I acted like a bank.
UNK: Aborigine. Oh, no, I tried that already.
Cheryl : Would you like to come in?
UNK: Did Homo erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Cheryl : According to recent findings.
Cheryl : Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!
Ross : Mitzi is...?
Cheryl : My hamster.
Cheryl : I hope she's okay. I haven't seen her in a while.
Cheryl : Have a seat.
UNK: Where?
Ross : Oh, hey. Do you...
Ross : Do you have any Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Ross : Well, I do.
UNK: Let's go back to my place, light a couple candles...
Ross : ...break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties...
Cheryl : -I'd rather not. -Oh, yeah? Why not?
Cheryl : Don't take this the wrong way...
UNK: ...but your place kind of has a weird smell.
Monica : -Is everything in the car? -Did you settle the bill?
Monica : I hate this part.
Phoebe : Look what we almost left!
Monica : That's not mine.
Phoebe : Look what we almost took!
