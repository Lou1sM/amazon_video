UNK: Not that I don't enjoy talking about high school...
UNK: ...because I do.
UNK: Maybe we can talk about something else.
UNK: I don't know where you work.
Chip : -You know where I work. -I do?
UNK: The movie theater. You used to come in all the time.
UNK: Still at the Multiplex?
UNK: Like I'd give up that job!
Chip : Free popcorn and candy anytime I want?
UNK: I can get you posters.
UNK: Thanks, I'm set.
UNK: Oh, you know who came in the other night? Peters.
UNK: Told me he just went out with Leslie Maskin. Got to third base.
Monica : Do you still live with your parents?
Chip : Yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
UNK: You know, with all of our stuff gone, the unit doesn't seem that big.
