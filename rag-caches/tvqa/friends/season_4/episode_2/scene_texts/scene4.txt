Phoebe : Thank you.
Rachel : I hate when Ross is right.
UNK: He is right, isn't he?
UNK: This might be one time when he's wrong.
All : -You think? -Oh, no. He's right.
Joey : About your mom.
UNK: How's that going?
Phoebe : So great. We took a nap together today.
Phoebe : Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
UNK: That's so sweet.
UNK: I'm gonna get some coffee.
UNK: What'd you say, Joe? I'll be right there.
Phoebe : I just feel so...
Chandler : -All right! -I'm coming already!
Monica : Not yet, not yet, not yet!
Rachel : -Hello, Chip. -How you doing?
UNK: I'm great!
Rachel : Got a great job. I have wonderful friends.
UNK: Though I'm not seeing anyone now, I've never felt better about myself.
UNK: So, Monica ready yet?
UNK: She'll be out in a second.
UNK: So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?
UNK: Amy Welsh? I haven't seen her since
Chip : So, Monica about ready?
UNK: -Wow, you look great. -Thanks.
UNK: -Well, you guys have fun. -Catch you later.
UNK: Bye, Chip.
UNK: -Are you sure you're okay about this? -Actually
UNK: Okay, great.
Joey : This is the unit for you.
Joey : Sturdy construction, tons of storage.
Joey : Some big enough to fit a grown man.
UNK: -What? -Yeah, I got in there myself once.
UNK: My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.
Joey : Then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
UNK: It was funny till I felt like it was a coffin.
UNK: No, you can't fit in there. It's not deep enough.
Joey : Oh, yeah?
UNK: If I can't...
UNK: ...I'll knock $5 off the price.
Guy : All right, you have yourself a deal.
UNK: See? I told you.
UNK: Sometimes I come in here just to get away from it.
Joey : Hey, a nickel!
