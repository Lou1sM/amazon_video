Phoebe : Dumb drunken bitch
Phoebe : Thank you!
UNK: Here's a question.
UNK: Where'd you get the "finest oak east of the Mississippi"?
UNK: First tell us where you got the prettiest lace in the land.
UNK: It's your ad.
Joey : Looks good?
UNK: "Stunning entertainment center, fine
UNK: Fine Italian craftsmanship."
UNK: You're selling the entertainment center?
UNK: Why? I love it.
Chandler : -You want it? -No.
UNK: Gepetto?
UNK: Five thousand dollars?
Chandler : Are you insane?
UNK: The ad alone cost $300.
UNK: I'm changing it to $50 or your best offer.
Joey : What kind of profit is that? And you call yourself an accountant?
Joey : What do you do?
UNK: I can't believe you don't know.
UNK: I actually don't know.
Phoebe : Oh, my God, no! Shoo, kitty!
UNK: There's a kitty in my guitar case.
UNK: Everyone's gonna want one.
Phoebe : Come on, you!
UNK: Crazy!
Monica : -Oh, my God! -What?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: What's wrong?
Phoebe : I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother.
Rachel : The mom you met in Montauk? She was a cat?
UNK: That makes the fact that she owns beach-front property all the more impressive.
Phoebe : No. She was a human lady.
UNK: This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly. The one that killed herself.
UNK: Have you been taking your grandmother's glaucoma medicine again?
Phoebe : No, Dr. Skeptismo.
UNK: I'm sure. First of all, there's the feeling.
Phoebe : And for another, she went into my guitar case...
Phoebe : ...which is lined with orange felt.
UNK: My mother's favorite fish was orange roughy.
UNK: Cats like fish.
UNK: You had me with orange felt.
Phoebe : Hi, Mommy!
UNK: I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.
UNK: -Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of -Let it go!
UNK: When were you going to tell me that you're dating Chip?
UNK: Now?
UNK: Can I go out with him?
UNK: No. I can't believe you'd want to after what he did to me.
UNK: That thing at the prom?
UNK: I couldn't find him for hours! He was having sex with Amy Welsh!
UNK: That was in high school. How can it still bother you?
UNK: Oh, yeah, you're right, Moni-cow.
UNK: Okay, I hear you.
UNK: Why do you have to go out with Chip?
UNK: We went to different schools.
UNK: We went to the same school.
Monica : You went to one where you were popular.
UNK: You rode on Chip's motorcycle and wore his letterman jacket.
Monica : I went to one where I wore a band uniform that was specially made.
UNK: They had that specially made?
UNK: It was a Home Ec project.
UNK: Oh, my God! They said it was for the mascot.
Monica : Back then I thought that I'd never get to go out with a Chip Matthews.
UNK: Now he's called me up and asked me out.
UNK: The fat girl inside me really wants to go. I owe her this.
Monica : I never let her eat.
Rachel : -You go out with him. -Really?
UNK: If possible, could you leave him and have sex with another guy?
