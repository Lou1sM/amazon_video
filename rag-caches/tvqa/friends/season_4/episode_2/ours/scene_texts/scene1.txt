UNK: We're not throwing it out. I built it with my own hands!
UNK: How about we sell it?
Chandler : All right.
UNK: But you'll have to tell them.
UNK: Can we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
UNK: Hey, why did the chicken fall out of the tree?
UNK: Why?
UNK: Because you have doody on your head.
UNK: Yeah, it was funnier when Ben told it.
Chip : Hey, Monica. It's Chip.
UNK: Who's Chip?
UNK: It was good running into you today.
UNK: My number is 555-9323. Give me a call.
UNK: "Chip" is Chip Matthews.
Ross : The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why's he calling you?
UNK: Because I ran into him at the bank. He is still so cute.
UNK: You're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!
Monica : I know!
UNK: Chip? Hi, it's Monica.
Monica : Oh, my God! We just had the best conversation!
Ross : I was just leaving.
UNK: Good.
UNK: I've got a report to read.
UNK: It's eight pages. I hope I don't fall asleep.
Ross : Why? Did you write it?
Rachel : Look at that!
Rachel : Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants.
UNK: Well, actually...
Rachel : I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
UNK: Why don't you give him a call?
UNK: -Are you sure you want to hear this? -I'm sure.
UNK: Chip! Hi, it's Rachel.
UNK: Rachel Greene.
Rachel : You left me a message?
Rachel : Yes, you did. My roommate wrote it down.
Rachel : Monica Geller?
UNK: Oh, that's right!
Ross : He called to ask out Monica.
UNK: That's got to be embarrassing.
