Rachel : So how was your date?
UNK: Well, I always wanted to go out with Chip in high school.
Monica : Tonight, I actually went out with Chip in high school.
UNK: Honey, I'm sorry.
Monica : Not only did I get to go out with Chip...
Monica : ...I got to dump Chip.
UNK: -That's so great! -I know.
Ross : What did the insurance company say?
UNK: They said, "You don't have insurance. Stop calling us."
UNK: You didn't tell her?
Ross : Okay, fine.
UNK: Listen...
Ross : ...this cat belongs to a little girl.
Ross : There are flyers all over the place.
UNK: I'm sorry, sweetie.
Monica : We can take her back with you if you want.
UNK: But, you know, she chose to find me.
Phoebe : I have to respect her decision, right?
UNK: -That's a good call. -That's right.
Ross : Enough is enough.
UNK: I'm sorry you feel guilty about spending time with your new mom.
UNK: But this isn't your old mom.
Ross : This is a cat.
Ross : Julio the cat.
Ross : Not Mom! Cat.
Phoebe : Ross, how many parents have you lost?
UNK: None.
UNK: Then you don't know how it feels when one of them comes back.
Phoebe : I believe this is my mother.
UNK: Even if I'm wrong, who cares?
Phoebe : Just be a friend, okay? Be supportive.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I don't know what to say.
Rachel : You could say...
UNK: ...you're sorry to her mom.
Phoebe : I think she would like that.
Ross : Come here. Here, come here.
Ross : Mrs. Buffay?
Ross : Sorry about what I said.
Ross : It was insensitive of me to say...
Ross : ...that you were just a cat...
Ross : ...when, clearly, you are also...
Ross : ...the reincarnated spirit...
UNK: ...of my friend's mother.
Phoebe : Thank you.
Phoebe : We both forgive you.
UNK: What will you do about the little girl?
UNK: Listen.
Phoebe : Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me.
UNK: You're welcome to come back anytime.
UNK: If she'd come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Phoebe : Come on. I'll take you home.
UNK: -I'll go with you. -Me too.
UNK: I got an extra futon.
UNK: Dude, you don't have to brag. We got nothing here.
Rachel : You know...
UNK: It's peaceful out here.
