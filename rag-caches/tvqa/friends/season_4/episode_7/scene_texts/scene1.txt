UNK: Oh, I can't. I got two dinner dates tonight, so I gotta get ready.
UNK: All right, girls' night out.
UNK: Sorry, but we have to prep that catering thing for tomorrow.
UNK: Oh, that's right.
UNK: I wish I could eat in restaurants alone.
UNK: You should try it. It's a really good thing to do.
UNK: I just think I'd feel really self-conscious. Like I was on display or something.
UNK: I was on display once. Nothing like eating alone.
UNK: I just had a great time with myself.
UNK: Well, this could be a good story.
UNK: At dinner. It was so liberating.
UNK: You know, I don't need people to have fun. I'm fun. I'm a fun girl.
UNK: Are you a naughty girl?
UNK: No, just fun. Fun. Good. Fun.
UNK: -See, I told you you'd have fun. -I know.
UNK: Although I must say that I totally judge any woman I see eating alone.
UNK: -Why? -What's wrong with a woman eating alone?
UNK: Well, obviously something. She's eating alone.
Ross : Okay, guys.
Chandler : All right! Bring it on, you!
Ross : Here we go.
UNK: You know, I've never played my stuff for anyone before.
UNK: So it's important that you understand...
UNK: ...it's about communicating...
Ross : ...very private emotions.
Phoebe : You know...
UNK: You should think of my work...
Ross : ...as wordless sound poems.
UNK: -That's what -Oh, my God, play.
UNK: Well, you know, that was...
UNK: ...terrific!
UNK: Really...
UNK: ...bitchen.
UNK: Wow! It was so wow!
UNK: Really?
Rachel : Yeah! I mean, you should play in public.
Ross : Wow, thanks, you guys. That's
UNK: I want to play you another piece.
Ross : I left my helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back, okay?
Ross : This is so nice. I mean, I am so...
UNK: God bless my dad for soundproofing the basement.
UNK: I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
