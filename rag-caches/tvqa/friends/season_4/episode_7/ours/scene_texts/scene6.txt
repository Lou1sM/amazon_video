UNK: ...and one thing led to another, and...
Joey : And what? Did you sleep with her?
Chandler : -No, I just kissed her. -What? That's even worse!
Chandler : -How is that worse? -It's the same!
UNK: There's nothing I could do. I think I'm in love with her!
Joey : Who cares?
Joey : You went behind my back? I'd never do that to you!
Chandler : I have no excuses. I was totally over the line.
UNK: You're so far past the line, that you can't even see the line!
Joey : The line is a dot to you!
Chandler : Yes, right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me.
UNK: Oh, my God. Is that why you bought all this stuff?
UNK: You know what?
Joey : I will not watch your TV.
UNK: I won't listen to your stereo.
UNK: And there's a loaf in the new bread maker I won't eat. Know why?
Chandler : -Probably because -It's all tainted with your betrayal!
UNK: This apartment is empty to me! I'm not happy about you either.
Joey : And just so you know...
Joey : ...I made that bread for you.
UNK: Oh, my God! He's lost it. He's totally lost it.
UNK: What?
UNK: This cannot get any worse.
Rachel : Rats in the basement are hanging themselves.
Ross : Thank you. Thanks.
Ross : I lost it.
UNK: I won't play anymore.
Ross : Would you? Can you finish my set?
Phoebe : After that? Yeah.
Phoebe : No, I mean, if I can help.
Ross : Yeah, like I could lose it.
UNK: What?
Ross : I played bad on purpose, guys.
UNK: Okay, you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Ross : No. Just that last song.
