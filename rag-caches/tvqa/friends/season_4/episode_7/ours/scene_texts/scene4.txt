UNK: -I'd love to, but I have plans on Sunday. -Well, maybe some other time.
UNK: -Sure. Just give me a call, I'm in the book. -Okay. Thanks a lot. See you.
UNK: What are you doing? He is cute, and he's a doctor.
Phoebe : -How do you know? -Honey, I eavesdrop because I care.
UNK: -Well, I have plans on Sunday. -With who?
UNK: -Me. -Oh, God.
UNK: You are the one who told me how important it is to spend time alone.
UNK: I can't just go out with that guy when I have plans with myself.
UNK: Wouldn't be fair to me.
UNK: So basically you're saying you don't want to cheat on yourself.
UNK: Well, if you wanna make me sound crazy.
Ross : Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Monica : Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Chandler : I kissed Kathy.
Monica : Are you serious?
Phoebe : -Does Joey know? -No.
UNK: Is there any way you think he will understand this?
UNK: You obviously haven't screwed over your friends.
Monica : Which we all appreciate.
UNK: If you'd told him how you felt before you kissed her...
Ross : ...knowing Joey, he'd have stepped aside.
UNK: Don't say that! That's not true, is it?
UNK: Yeah, he loves you.
UNK: Then why didn't you tell me to do that?
Ross : I said something to Phoebe.
Phoebe : And I thought it was a really good idea.
UNK: -Yeah, I remember. -Oh, my God!
UNK: What am I going to do?
UNK: -You'll have to tell him. -Why do I have to tell him?
Rachel : -Because you do. -Yeah, I know.
Ross : Would it be okay if I wrote a song about this?
UNK: I don't know if this is working out. I think...
UNK: I think I wanna see other people.
UNK: Wow. Didn't see that coming.
UNK: It's not that I don't enjoy this. I do.
UNK: I just wanna see what else is out there.
UNK: Hey, Guy. What are you doing here?
UNK: I work across the street.
UNK: -It turns out I'm gonna be free Sunday. -I wish you had called me.
UNK: I just told them I'd work this weekend.
UNK: Okay, well, maybe next weekend.
UNK: -Definitely. I'll see you. -Okay.
UNK: Yeah, you'll be talking to me never, because you're a freak who eats alone.
UNK: Sambuca margarita?
UNK: It that a real thing?
UNK: Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.
UNK: Listen, Joe. I need to I need to talk to you about something.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: It's about Kathy.
Chandler : I like her.
Chandler : I like her a lot, actually.
Kathy : -You do? -Yeah.
UNK: Your timing couldn't be better.
UNK: She's not my girlfriend anymore.
UNK: What?
Joey : -Yeah, she broke up with me. -When?
Joey : Just now, after acting class.
UNK: I thought she was doing some scene, so I let people watch.
Chandler : Man, I am so sorry. Are you okay?
UNK: I've been better, but I'm all right. So you like her?
UNK: Yes, but I don't have to.
UNK: No, it's okay.
Joey : You know why? Because you came to me first.
Chandler : I thought that would be the best thing to do.
UNK: You might have your work cut out for you.
