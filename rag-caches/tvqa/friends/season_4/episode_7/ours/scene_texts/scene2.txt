Phoebe : What are you guys talking about? I loved it!
UNK: It was so moving.
UNK: It's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
UNK: You mean, music?
UNK: I know what you think.
Chandler : Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Chandler : Come in.
Kathy : Oh, God! Is that Baywatch?
Chandler : Yes, but I just watch it for the articles.
Kathy : -So is Joey around? -No, he's not back yet.
UNK: Come in, have a seat. Bow or stern?
UNK: I don't have a preference. You?
Chandler : I like it in the stern.
Chandler : Of the boat.
UNK: It's me. Casey and I had a little car trouble.
Chandler : -What happened? -We broke down.
UNK: I have to get transmission fluid.
UNK: Tell Kathy that I'm sorry and I'll be there soon.
UNK: -Why can't you tell her? -I think my time is about to
Chandler : I thought your time ran out.
Joey : Me too, but I guess I do have
UNK: Joey's running a little late, and he says he's sorry.
UNK: I guess it's just you and me, then.
UNK: -Okay. -Yeah, I think it is.
UNK: So, what'd you do today?
Chandler : I had an appointment to cut my hair.
Kathy : -Looks great! -And then it got canceled.
Kathy : -I could cut it. -Really? Do you do that?
UNK: Yeah, I learned at my aunt's dog-grooming shop. What do you say?
Kathy : Dog grooming?
UNK: Don't make my tail too poofy.
Kathy : You have really great hair.
UNK: Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.
UNK: You know who also has great hair is Joey.
UNK: Yes, Joey has great hair.
UNK: I'm basically done here. Let me get this hair off your neck.
UNK: What are you doing?
UNK: Checking to see if it's even.
Kathy : Looks good.
Chandler : The phone! The phone's making sounds!
UNK: Hey, dude, it's me.
UNK: Hey, it's Joey!
UNK: It looks like we'll be stuck here.
UNK: I got the fluid. The transmission wasn't there.
UNK: -What? -It fell out.
Joey : I just figured we hit a dog.
Joey : Could you put Kathy on? I want to apologize to her.
UNK: It's Joey.
UNK: No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
UNK: Yeah, no, stop apologizing. It's okay.
UNK: I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Kathy : I should probably go.
Kathy : I forgot my purse.
Kathy : I really did. I forgot my purse.
UNK: -This is bad! It's bad! -Horrible!
UNK: Wait, the kiss or the situation?
Kathy : The kiss was good.
UNK: -But that's bad! -Here's what we do.
