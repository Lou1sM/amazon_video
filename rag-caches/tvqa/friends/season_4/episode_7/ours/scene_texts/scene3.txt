Chandler : -We forget it happened. -What?
Chandler : We swallow our feelings, even if we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Kathy : Can you really do that?
UNK: I have to. He's my best friend.
UNK: And you're seeing him.
Kathy : Chandler, I like Joey a lot.
Kathy : -But with you -No, don't! Don't, see?
UNK: You're getting me confused. I'm starting to yearn.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: If you want to pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Chandler : I think we have to.
Chandler : Are you still out there?
UNK: Electrifying
UNK: Infinite time
UNK: There's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
UNK: He's so inspired. Just look at him. Look at him go!
UNK: Thank you very much!
UNK: Hey, aren't you up next?
UNK: -I'm not playing tonight. -Why not?
UNK: I can't follow Ross.
UNK: It'd be like those poor bicycle-riding chimps...
UNK: ...who had to follow the Beatles. No.
Monica : Ross sucks.
Rachel : The place has emptied because of him.
UNK: Oh, my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time.
Phoebe : I'd give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Monica : You suck too.
UNK: You're awful.
Ross : You guys!
Monica : You suck too!
UNK: Man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Chandler : Hang on, buddy.
Joey : Oh, my God! What happened?
Chandler : That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place.
Phoebe : You were really great. You were really, really great.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Monica tells me you don't want to play anymore because of me...
UNK: ...and, you know, my talent.
Ross : Is that true?
UNK: Well, kind of, yeah.
UNK: I was trying to be really okay and upbeat about it...
UNK: ...but I just feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.
Ross : See, but...
UNK: Pheebs, that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
UNK: You know, my music is meant to inspire.
Ross : If it bothers you this much...
UNK: ...then I won't play anymore.
UNK: No, don't do that.
UNK: How could I live if I knew I was depriving the world of your music?
Ross : Yeah, okay.
