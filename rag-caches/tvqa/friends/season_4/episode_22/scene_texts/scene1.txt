Joey : What party?
UNK: Phoebe's baby shower.
UNK: Baby shower? That so doesn't sound like something I want to do.
UNK: I can't believe I'm going to have a party.
UNK: That's so great. A party!
UNK: I don't know why.
UNK: This is what I got going for the party liquor-wise.
Joey : -Get a lot of liquor. -Great.
Joey : In terms of the invite list, I got you, me and Chandler.
UNK: I'll invite Gunther because we're talking pretty loud.
UNK: I'll be there.
UNK: I know it's your party...
UNK: ...but I'd like to limit the number of museum geeks.
UNK: Let's not invite any anthropologists. Just the dinosaur dudes.
UNK: We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
UNK: Hey, what are you doing?
Ross : Just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Chandler : Good luck trying to top the last one.
UNK: It won't be that difficult since this one won't be...
Ross : ...in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
UNK: I'm Ross, I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut.
Ross : I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything sounds great.
Ross : Keep it on the mellow side. A few guys hanging out.
Ross : -No strippers or anything. -You got it.
UNK: See you later.
UNK: Have fun planning your mellow party.
UNK: There will be strippers. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
Chandler : He just said, "No strippers."
Joey : I chose not to hear that.
Monica : Look what I got, look what I got!
Monica : They make these for little people!
Rachel : Little Village People.
Monica : Look at this one. This is my favorite.
Rachel : That is so sweet.
UNK: Phoebe will love dressing them.
UNK: Except she won't be the one who gets to dress them.
UNK: She won't get to keep the babies.
Rachel : My God, we are throwing the most depressing baby shower!
Monica : Unless we give her all gifts she can use after her pregnancy.
UNK: Like regular coffee. Tequila!
UNK: -A carton of cigarettes! -She doesn't smoke.
UNK: -It's the thought that counts. -It's a great idea.
UNK: And those leather pants she's always wanted!
UNK: She'll love that!
Phoebe : What the hell is this?
UNK: You thought it'd make me feel better?
UNK: To give me something I can't use for two months?
Phoebe : This sucks!
UNK: -Who gave me this? -Well, I
UNK: They told me you like them.
UNK: All right, then I'm wrong. It's a great gift. The best present I ever got!
UNK: What's my next present?
UNK: We don't have anything.
UNK: All right, fine, then this is over.
UNK: Balloons!
UNK: -Listen, about the stripper... -Yeah?
Ross : Good call!
