UNK: I called 911 and they yelled at me. This is an emergency!
UNK: I really wanna help you out, but I got plans to go see Titanic...
UNK: ...so I've got to call 911 to find out what time it starts.
Ross : Hey, guys.
UNK: Thanks again for last night. What a great party.
Ross : The guys from work had a blast.
Ross : One of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Ross : Another one had never been to a party before.
UNK: So that wedding ring.
UNK: -Man, that is nice. -Yeah, right?
UNK: I might pick one of those babies up for myself.
UNK: Where might one get one of those?
Ross : When my grandmother first came to this country...
Ross : ...that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Chandler : So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.
UNK: Absolutely. It's been in my family for generations.
UNK: Every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
UNK: So you might say it's a magic ring.
Joey : Yeah, the stripper stole it.
UNK: What?
UNK: -What did you just -I think I heard what he said.
UNK: I believe it was, "The stripper stole the ring."
UNK: My ring? My wedding ring?
Ross : The stripper stole my wedding ring?
Ross : How could this happen?
Chandler : It all started when you said, "Joey, you be my best man!"
Ross : All right. I'm going to call the cops.
Joey : I screwed up. But you don't have to turn me in.
Ross : -Not on you, on the stripper. -I already did that.
UNK: They said they'd look into it after they solve all the murders.
UNK: -We'll call the company that sent her. -I did that too.
UNK: They wouldn't give me her real name.
UNK: They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.
UNK: I said, "You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring."
UNK: So, what are you telling me?
UNK: There's nothing we can do?
Ross : -How could this happen? -Look, Ross, I am so sorry.
UNK: What if we just called her...
Chandler : ...used a fake name and had her come to my office?
Joey : That sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
UNK: Here's your tea, Phoebe.
UNK: It's so good.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: -Good. -So glad you like it.
Rachel : What? She made the tea.
Phoebe : I think I just had a contraction.
UNK: -What? -My God!
UNK: I felt one a few minutes ago.
UNK: That definitely was one.
UNK: You can't have the baby here.
UNK: I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
UNK: It's okay. I'll boil some water and rip up some sheets.
UNK: It's probably false labor.
Phoebe : That can happen near the end. Just get the book.
Phoebe : -Get the book! -The book!
Monica : -The Bible? -I don't know!
UNK: All right. This is great.
Joey : You get behind the desk.
Joey : When she comes in, she won't recognize you because
Joey : Well, why would she?
Joey : And then you buzz Ross and I.
UNK: You be Mr. Gonzales, and I'll be Mr. Wong.
UNK: Diverse.
UNK: The Stripper : Anybody call for security?
Chandler : You be cool.
