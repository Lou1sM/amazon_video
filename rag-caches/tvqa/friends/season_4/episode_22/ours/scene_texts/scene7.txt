UNK: I know it's going to be over soon so...
UNK: But isn't that a good thing?
Rachel : -You said you were sick of this. -I know.
UNK: Usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing...
Phoebe : ...you get to do the mom thing.
UNK: But I'll be sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
Monica : Some moms do that.
UNK: That's even sadder.
UNK: Look, I know what I got myself into.
UNK: It's just that now that they're in me...
UNK: ...it's like I know them and...
UNK: It just won't be easy when these babies have to go away.
UNK: I know, sweetie.
UNK: But it's not like you won't have anything.
UNK: You'll have nieces and nephews. That's even better.
Phoebe : -Yeah, okay. -No, really.
UNK: You won't be the one worrying about saving for college.
UNK: Or yelling at them when they're bad.
UNK: Or putting them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down.
UNK: You'll be the one they run away to. The one they talk to about sex.
Rachel : You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.
Rachel : Cool Aunt Phoebe.
Phoebe : I am pretty cool.
UNK: And you know what else? Are they going to love you!
UNK: They are going to love me.
Phoebe : Thanks, you guys. Again.
Monica : Oh, sweetie.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Just kidding.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: Got you again. You're so easy!
UNK: If anything happens to him
Ross : The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Joey : Things can go wrong. What if he doesn't make it?
Chandler : -He will, Joe. -But what if he doesn't?
UNK: He's such a good duck.
UNK: I'm so worried about him!
UNK: The Doctor : Somebody lose a ring?
Rachel : Oh, my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
UNK: How's the duck?
UNK: The Doctor : Just fine. You'll see him in a bit.
UNK: Great.
Joey : -Thanks for being so cool. -No, that's all right.
Joey : You made me your best man and I totally let you down.
UNK: -It's not your fault. -Yeah, it is.
UNK: You wouldn't have lost it.
Joey : Ross, you were right. He should be your best man.
Chandler : -No, you should. -Don't argue.
Ross : I get to choose my best man.
Ross : I want both you guys.
UNK: Really?
Ross : Both you guys should be up there with me.
UNK: You two are my
UNK: I'm lucky to have just one good
Chandler : Thanks, man.
UNK: I got to go check something, okay?
Chandler : -What a baby! -Total wuss.
UNK: -How come you're getting Nana's ring? -Mom gave it to me.
UNK: She said something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need...
UNK: ...one.
UNK: I really didn't need to tell you all that.
UNK: I don't really think it's fair. I mean, I've always loved that ring.
UNK: Oh, Mon, I'm sorry.
UNK: I'd let you have it, but Emily's gotten really attached to it.
UNK: Thanks.
Joey : -Here you go. -Thanks.
UNK: Emily, did you know that that ring spent two days in a duck's colon?
