UNK: Which one is Gunther Central Perk?
UNK: Joey.
UNK: Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring.
Chandler : Way to be cool, man.
UNK: What?
Joey : There was a ring in a box. After you left, it was gone.
UNK: You think I stole some ring?
UNK: We know you took it! Just save yourself the time and confess.
UNK: The Stripper : Who are you, the Hardy Boys?
UNK: I don't need to steal a stupid ring. I make $1,600 a week.
UNK: The Stripper : Any of you guys make that?
Chandler : Marry me.
UNK: I don't get it. It was in my room all night. She didn't take it.
UNK: I didn't take it. You didn't take it. Then who did?
