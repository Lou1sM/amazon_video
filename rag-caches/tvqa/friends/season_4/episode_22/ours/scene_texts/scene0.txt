UNK: That was the 10th time I've peed here.
UNK: It's also the 10th time you've told us.
UNK: Sorry, it must be hard to hear.
UNK: It's easier having babies playing "Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!
UNK: I am so sick of being pregnant. God!
UNK: I can't sleep, except on my back, which hurt. So I can't sleep.
UNK: My only happiness is from a cup of coffee...
UNK: ...which is decaf because I'm pregnant!
Ross : You want a cookie?
Phoebe : Thank you so much!
UNK: So, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
UNK: I haven't had any yet.
UNK: The One with the Worst Best Man Ever
Ross : Hey, guys.
UNK: All right, here's the ring.
Chandler : Yes, yes! A thousand times, yes!
Ross : Any ideas for the bachelor party?
UNK: Before rings and bachelor parties, you have to decide who your best man will be.
UNK: Oh, it's awkward.
UNK: I already asked Chandler.
Joey : He got to do it at your first wedding.
UNK: I figured you'd understand. I've known him longer.
UNK: I don't have any brothers. I'll never be a best man.
Chandler : You can be the best man when I get married.
UNK: I'll never get to be a best man!
UNK: Wait, wait.
UNK: So you'll be my best man twice, and I won't be yours at all?
UNK: Of course, you can be my best man.
UNK: -What about me? You said I could. -I'm not getting married!
UNK: It's a question for science-fiction writers.
UNK: I can't believe it's not me.
UNK: -How could it not be me? -I'm not even
UNK: You know what? That's it.
Ross : From now on, Joey will be my best man.
UNK: Shame about you, though.
Phoebe : -Stop it. -What?
Phoebe : One of the babies is kicking.
UNK: That's a good thing.
UNK: It's not kicking me. It's kicking another baby.
UNK: Don't make me come in there!
UNK: Do you have a big bowl I can borrow?
UNK: There's one under the cabinet.
Monica : -Why do you need it? -We're having a party tomorrow night.
UNK: -Are you planning on inviting us? -No. Later!
Phoebe : Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!
UNK: Hormones.
UNK: How come you're having a party and we're not invited?
UNK: -It's Ross' bachelor party. -So?
Joey : Are you bachelors?
Joey : Are you strippers?
UNK: Then you're not invited.
UNK: Then you're not invited to our party either.
