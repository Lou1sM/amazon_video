UNK: What is that song?
UNK: It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
UNK: You know who doesn't like dirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.
Joey : Yeah, right.
UNK: He said he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Chandler : Did he also say that the dialogue was corny?
UNK: -And that he found it funny, not sexy? -Yes.
Joey : Yeah, he likes porn.
UNK: Where you going?
Rachel : To find out if he really thinks models are too skinny.
UNK: How'd it go?
Phoebe : Frank has to quit college...
UNK: ...because his super-fertile sister's having three babies.
UNK: I need to make money fast. I wanted to talk to you about an idea.
Phoebe : You work for a big company.
Phoebe : Insider trading.
UNK: What information can you give me?
UNK: They don't talk to us about that stuff.
UNK: But I can get you free White-Out.
Monica : -Did you do what I said? -I did.
UNK: -What'd she say? -"Thank you."
UNK: You're totally welcome. What'd she say?
Ross : She said, "Thank you."
Ross : I said, "I love you."
Ross : And she said, "Thank you."
UNK: That's not right.
Chandler : Did you say you love her?
Joey : What were you trying to get her to do?
Ross : -What do I do now? -You play hard-to-get.
Ross : She already lives in London.
UNK: So you go to Tokyo.
Chandler : Forget it.
Chandler : You told her you love her. It's over.
Monica : It is not over! You're over!
UNK: What?
Phoebe : You know.
Chandler : Good one.
UNK: It's not over. She'll call and tell you she loves you.
Monica : Her feelings were so strong that it scared her.
Monica : Go home and wait for her call. She could call from the plane.
UNK: But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over!
Ross : Unless, eventually, I call her to see what's going on...
UNK: ...and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't.
UNK: Then it's over!
Joey : Way to be strong!
UNK: Can we watch cartoons on your TV?
Chandler : We need a porn break.
UNK: We spent two hours watching In and Out and In Again.
UNK: Why don't you turn it off?
Chandler : Then we'd be the guys who turned off free porn.
UNK: Yeah, but that's not what you'd go by.
UNK: Look, I'm going to have a kid someday. Okay?
UNK: And someday that kid is going to ask me if I ever turned off free porn.
UNK: I don't wanna have to tell him that I did.
UNK: Did you ever asked you dad that?
UNK: I don't want to talk about it.
UNK: Good, you're here!
UNK: What you got there?
UNK: This? I'm glad you asked.
UNK: Don't you hate to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
