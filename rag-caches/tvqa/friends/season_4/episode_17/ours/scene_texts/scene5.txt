UNK: I know what you're thinking.
Chandler : Pregnant woman slays four?
UNK: -Did they make you pay for those knives? -No.
Rachel : -Are you sure? -No.
UNK: You won't make enough money by selling knives.
UNK: I just need enough money for the second part of my plan.
UNK: -What's that? -My Saturn dealership.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: -Ross. -Emily. Hi.
UNK: How was your flight?
Emily : It was dreadful.
UNK: It was terrible how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
UNK: No, that's all right.
UNK: I'm just glad you called.
UNK: Ross, there's something that I've got to tell you.
UNK: There's someone else.
Ross : Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
UNK: She doesn't know who she wants. Me or this "Colin" guy.
UNK: So I told her when she figures it out, give me a call. Maybe I'll still be around.
UNK: When you say "still around," you mean still around like you might be in a relationship...
UNK: ...or still around like you might have died waiting for the phone to ring?
UNK: But it was so right.
UNK: This isn't how it's supposed to go. There can't be another guy.
UNK: Of course, there's another guy!
Monica : This is even more perfect.
Monica : You have to prove your love!
UNK: I'm not proving anything. I'm done listening to you.
UNK: If I hadn't let you talk me into this...
UNK: ...I wouldn't have put my fist through the wall.
UNK: You did that?
Ross : I missed and hit the door.
Ross : But it opened really hard.
Monica : You have to go to London. You have to go fight for her.
Joey : That makes sense.
UNK: You said you loved her, and she didn't say it back.
UNK: Then she told you about another guy. Go to London. Scare her!
UNK: When Rachel was with Paolo, what did you do?
Ross : I made fun of his accent.
Monica : You sat back and let him have her. You didn't fight.
UNK: I just told you, I made fun of him behind his back.
UNK: Oh, I see.
UNK: -You want that to happen with Emily? -No.
Monica : All right then, go fight for her!
UNK: It's like a snake pit.
Monica : That could be you and Emily.
UNK: That but nicer.
Monica : Go to London!
UNK: Really?
Monica : Surprise her. Don't let her go without a fight.
UNK: All right. I'm going to do it.
UNK: I'm going to London, and I'll fight for her.
Monica : Okay. Good luck!
UNK: Can you pick me up one of those Toblerone bars at the airport?
Phoebe : I did it! I figured out a way to make money.
UNK: I'll open a massage place. Frank will help me.
UNK: We'll work it around his schedule, so he doesn't have to quit school.
