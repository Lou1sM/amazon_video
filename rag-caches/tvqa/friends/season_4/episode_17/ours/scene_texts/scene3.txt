UNK: How'd it go at the doctor's?
UNK: You know how, when you're walking down the street...
Phoebe : ...and you see three people in a row.
UNK: And you say "Oh, that's nice."
Phoebe : Good news! You'll have three babies.
UNK: The Doctor : Three babies?
UNK: I've finally got my band!
UNK: We'll have a big family! I always wanted a big family.
UNK: Oh, God, I'm so glad you're happy! I was afraid you'd be freaked.
Frank : Why would we be freaked?
UNK: Because it's harder to raise them and the added expense.
UNK: Right.
Phoebe : No, back to happy. Back to happy!
UNK: It's going to be fine...
Alice : ...because I teach home ec.
Alice : I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long.
UNK: It'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
UNK: I was thinking, ever since you said we'd have triplets.
Frank : The best thing for me to do is drop out of college and get a job.
UNK: No, you can't quit college.
UNK: You're in college?
Frank : Refrigerator college.
Frank : When we found out we were having a baby...
UNK: ...I figured I should have a career, you know?
Frank : And I love refrigerators.
UNK: You can't give up on your dream!
UNK: No, it's okay. We're going to have three kids.
UNK: And that's a different kind of dream.
Frank : Three kids and no money.
UNK: This is the boarding call for flight 009.

Ross : I had to see you before you took off.
Emily : You are so sweet.
UNK: That's a big candy bar.
Ross : I had the most amazing time with you.
Emily : Me too.
UNK: This is the final boarding call for flight 009.
UNK: Well, that's me.
Emily : Here, have this.
UNK: I'm only allowed one piece of carry-on.
UNK: Listen, I have to tell you something.
UNK: I've been thinking.
UNK: I'm just going to say it, okay?
Ross : I think...
Monica : ...I love you.
Emily : Thank you.
UNK: It's no problem.
