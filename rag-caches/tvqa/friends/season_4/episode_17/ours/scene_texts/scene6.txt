UNK: But how can you afford it?
Rachel : We were walking down the street, and we saw your van.
UNK: -And we realized -I'm telling it!
Phoebe : People need transportation, and they need massages to relax.
UNK: We can combine the two. I give massages and Frank drives.
UNK: I'll bolt a table in the van, and you know what I've got?
UNK: A place that no one will get out of alive?
UNK: Think about it. It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax.
UNK: It's a Relaxi-Taxi!
UNK: The name was my favorite part!
UNK: -I came up with it. -You did not!
UNK: You came up with Relaxi-Cab. That's not good.
UNK: Oh, my god! Are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
