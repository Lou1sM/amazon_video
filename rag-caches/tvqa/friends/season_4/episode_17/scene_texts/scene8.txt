UNK: It's not Relaxi-Cab. It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.
Phoebe : That is better.
UNK: Do you have any 8's?
UNK: No.
Chandler : Are we in London?
UNK: Why are you here? You can't be here.
UNK: I've come to talk to Ross.
UNK: What?
UNK: Nothing.
Emily : I was going to call him
Monica : You came to tell him you love him. I knew it!
Monica : I was right! I'm right, right?
UNK: I'd rather talk to him.
UNK: I've been to his apartment and he's not there.
Emily : I need to talk to him. Do you know where he is?
Emily : Ross, are you there?
UNK: Ross, I don't know if you hear this, but I'll talk anyway.
UNK: I'm in the States with your sister and friends.
UNK: It's all over with Colin.
Emily : I came here to tell you that and to tell you
Emily : Yes, Joey, you can have all the chocolate you want.
Emily : I came here to tell you that I love you.
Monica : I love you too!
UNK: I'll call you right now from the phone booth.
UNK: You can't hear me.
UNK: I wish I knew if you'd heard me.
UNK: I suppose I've given my neighbors a good laugh.
UNK: Mrs. Newman, if you're listening, bugger off. None of your business.
UNK: There's not much chance you did hear that.
UNK: There's the call waiting...
Emily : ...so I should go.
Phoebe : Oh, well.
Emily : Ross, I love you.
Emily : Thank you.
Chandler : I was just at the bank. There was this really hot teller...
UNK: ...and she didn't ask me to do it with her in the vault.
UNK: Same thing happened to me.
UNK: Pizza delivery girl comes over, gives me the pizza and leaves!
Chandler : No "Nice apartment, bet the bedrooms are huge"?
UNK: Nothing!
Phoebe : You know what? We have to turn off the porn.
UNK: I think you're right.
UNK: Ready?
UNK: One, two, three.
UNK: That's kind of nice.
UNK: That's kind of a relief.
UNK: You want to see if we still have it?
Monica : -Free porn! -We have free porn!
UNK: There's one, two and three.
Phoebe : -Oh, my God. -That's so beautiful.
UNK: -Oh, man. -I can't believe it.
Phoebe : I know.
UNK: I like the middle one the best.
UNK: Don't worry, I won't let the other two know.
