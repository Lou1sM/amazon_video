Rachel : -Is that the heartbeat? -That's it.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Rachel : This is so cool!
UNK: Have we talked about multiple births?
UNK: Let's take care of this one. If I get pregnant again, I have your card.
UNK: No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Phoebe : You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one.
UNK: The Doctor : Doctors are wrong all the time.
Rachel : Are you sure that there are three?
UNK: -Definitely. -Oh, my God.
UNK: So in a few months, I'll have three babies walking around inside me?
UNK: It'll be like one of those log rides when they come shooting out.
UNK: The Doctor : Giving birth to three is like giving birth to one.
Phoebe : What do you know?
UNK: -Have you ever had triplets? -No. I'm sorry, I haven't.
UNK: I'm going to use this a lot.
