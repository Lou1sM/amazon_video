Joey : Name one famous person named Chandler.
Chandler : Raymond Chandler.
UNK: Someone you didn't make up.
UNK: There are no famous Joeys. Except for...
Chandler : ...Joey Buttafucco.
Joey : Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Phoebe : How about a compromise then? What if it's...
UNK: ...Chan-no-ey?
UNK: Joey? Think about it. He'll never be President.
UNK: There will never be a President Joey.
UNK: I didn't want to bring this up.
Joey : Chandler is the stupidest name I've heard in my life!
UNK: It's not a name! It's barely even a word.
UNK: It's like chandelier but it's not!
UNK: Then, you put it together with Bing and forget about it.
UNK: It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!
UNK: You're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
UNK: I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.
UNK: So I guess it's Joey then.
