Rachel : This place is fabulous!
Joshua : This is the downstairs living room.
UNK: There's two living rooms?
Rachel : Growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
UNK: It would have been, but my parents just moved here.
Rachel : You should know this place is a real babe magnet.
UNK: Want to make out?
UNK: Why don't I put the food in the fridge...
Joshua : ...and we can eat it later?
Rachel : That sounds like a plan.
Rachel : Is there a place that I could go freshen up?
UNK: Just down the hall and second door to your left.
UNK: Mrs. Burgin : -Hi, darling. -What are you doing here?
UNK: Mrs. Burgin : -We cut the trip short. -France sucks!
Joshua : This may be a little weird, but I've got a date here.
UNK: Mrs. Burgin : Say no more.
UNK: We'll grab some food, go upstairs and be out of your hair.
Susan : That'd be great. So you didn't get to Italy?
UNK: Mr. Burgin : Yep. Sucks!
Chandler : Hi, you!
Joshua : Oh, my God!
Rachel : I know. I can do more than cook.
UNK: I like her. She seems smart.
Joshua : Rachel, my parents.
Rachel : So nice to meet you.
UNK: Mrs. Burgin : Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
UNK: What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.
Rachel : Okay, I work in fashion.
Rachel : And this is a real dress, actually.
UNK: They're wearing it in Milan.
UNK: Part of my job is to wear the clothes and see how people respond.
Rachel : Then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's.
UNK: Obviously, in this case...
UNK: ...I am going to report back :
Rachel : "U.S.A. not ready."
UNK: Mrs. Burgin : Maybe in L.A.
Joshua : There you go!
UNK: Mr. Burgin : Have you kids eaten yet?
Rachel : We were going to do that after. I mean, next.
UNK: Why don't we all get something to eat?
Rachel : No use wasting this baby just lying around the house.
UNK: So we'll go eat.
UNK: You'll wear that.
UNK: We'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.
Joey : I am sorry about what I said.
UNK: Nope, you're right. It is a ridiculous name!
UNK: It's not bad.
Chandler : Yes, it is!
Chandler : From now on, I have no first name.
UNK: You're just Bing?
Chandler : I have no name.
Phoebe : So what are we supposed to call you?
Chandler : Okay, for now, temporarily, you can call me...
UNK: ...Clint.
Joey : No way are you cool enough to pull off "Clint."
Chandler : What name am I cool enough to pull off?
UNK: Gene.
UNK: It's Clint.
UNK: It's Clint!
Phoebe : Bye, Gene.
UNK: It's Clint!
UNK: What's up with Gene?
Monica : You wore your nightie to dinner?
UNK: The best part was when the waiter spilled water down my back.
Rachel : I jumped up and my boob popped out.
UNK: It's all right. I got nice boobs.
