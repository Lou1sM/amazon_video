UNK: It is true what they say :
Chandler : Pregnant bellies look like a drum.
UNK: I'm so pregnant that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.
UNK: So I'm going to play my songs on this drum.
Phoebe : It sounds really cool!
Phoebe : Listen, listen.
Phoebe : Smelly cat, smelly cat
Phoebe : What are they feeding you?
Joey : That sounds great!
UNK: I know! And I've only been playing for an hour.
Phoebe : -What are you doing here? -I came to ask you a big favor.
UNK: Don't tell me you want to keep more stuff in my uterus.
Alice : Okay. Now, see.
UNK: I want to name the girl baby Leslie.
Alice : And Frank wants to name one of the boy babies...
Alice : ...Frank Jr., Jr.
UNK: Wouldn't that be Frank lll?
UNK: Don't get me started.
UNK: Anyway, since there are three babies...
UNK: ...and we both got to put our names in...
UNK: ...we would be truly honored if you would name the other boy baby.
UNK: That's so nice!
UNK: Cougar.
Alice : Think about it.
UNK: The One with Rachel's New Dress
UNK: I left a bra drying in there.
UNK: Will your son think it's yours and be traumatized?
Ross : Mommy can have a wife. Daddy can have a bra.
UNK: It's time to go.
UNK: See, that clock's a little fast.
UNK: We still have 17 minutes.
Ross : What can we do in 17 minutes...
UNK: ...twice?
UNK: Well, that's ambitious.
Ross : You can ignore that.
UNK: That's your son.
UNK: Believe me, when he's older, he'll understand.
UNK: I'll be right there.
Ross : This is Carol and Susan.
UNK: -It's so nice to finally meet you. -You too.
UNK: -Susan will be in London next week. -I've never been there.
UNK: -I'll show you around. -Great!
Susan : Also, I was hoping to catch a show. Any suggestions?
UNK: There's tons of terrific stuff.
UNK: I'll go with you.
Ross : Look at you two bonding.
Ross : Making us late for the airport.
Emily : Are you all right?
UNK: It's just us getting along is difficult for him...
UNK: ...because he doesn't like me.
UNK: Come on. That's...
UNK: It's true.
UNK: How did we lose?
Chandler : Do we have a baby name yet?
UNK: No. It's so hard!
UNK: I went through this book and found nothing.
UNK: I want a name that's really strong and confident.
UNK: You know? Like...Exxon!
Chandler : It certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
