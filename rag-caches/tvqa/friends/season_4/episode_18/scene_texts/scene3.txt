Joshua : This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Rachel : Please! Cooking soothes me.
Rachel : So dig in!
UNK: It all looks so good.
Joshua : Oh, my God.
Phoebe : I know. My God, this rice is so
Rachel : I am so good!
Joshua : Behind you.
Rachel : They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.
Joshua : Is there some way that they could not be here?
Joshua : Farm birds really kind of freak me out!
UNK: Here we go.
Joshua : There you go!
UNK: Hey! How'd you do that?
Rachel : All gone.
Rachel : So, farm birds, huh?
UNK: It's my only weird thing, I swear.
UNK: I would have told you. I didn't know that they'd be here.
Rachel : Can I serve you a little
UNK: What?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: It's just that I know that they're still out there.
UNK: They're across the hall. That's two doors away.
UNK: It'll take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
UNK: That's not funny.
Rachel : Would you feel better if we went someplace else?
UNK: We could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment.
UNK: They're working on it. It's a mess.
UNK: I'm staying at my parents' house. We could go there.
UNK: They're out of town.
UNK: It's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view.
UNK: It'd be very romantic.
Joshua : -What do you say? -Yeah, that works.
UNK: They can smell the fear.
UNK: How's Ben?
UNK: I asked if he wanted to eat. He said no.
UNK: I asked if he wanted to sleep. He said no.
UNK: I asked what he wanted to do. He said no.
UNK: So he's sweeping.
Ross : Any word from Susan?
UNK: She said she's having so much fun with Emily.
Ross : By the by, did it ever occur to you that...
Ross : ...maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
UNK: What's too much fun?
Ross : The kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.
Joshua : Oh, my God! You are so paranoid.
Rachel : Am I?
Rachel : Am I?
Carol : Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Ross : Carol, so were we.
Ross : Just imagine for a moment...
UNK: ...that Susan meets someone, and they hit it off.
UNK: They're coming back from the theater, and they stop at a pub for drinks.
UNK: They're laughing.
Ross : Someone innocently touches someone else.
UNK: There's electricity.
UNK: It's new. It's exciting.
UNK: Are you saying there isn't the slightest possibility...
Ross : ...of something happening?
UNK: -Maybe. -Oh, my God!
UNK: I didn't really believe it until you just said it!
Joshua : None of the other kids believed me, but I swear that duck pushed me.
