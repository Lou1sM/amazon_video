Phoebe : She turned you into this untrusting, crazy, jealous...
UNK: ...sycophant!
UNK: So I don't know what "sycophant" means, but the rest is right.
UNK: What are you talking about? I am not a crazy, jealous person.
UNK: She's right.
UNK: When we were together, you got upset about Mark, and there was nothing.
UNK: This makes sense.
Ross : It does not!
Monica : In high school, you weren't jealous at all...
Monica : ...even though all your girlfriends cheated on you.
UNK: So up until '92, '93, he was very trusting.
UNK: Then '94 hit, Carol left him, and bam! Paranoid City!
UNK: Absolutely!
UNK: This is so fun!
Ross : This is not fun!
UNK: All we're trying to say is...
UNK: ...don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you've got with Emily.
UNK: The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Ross : I still think I was right about that Mark thing.
UNK: Well, you know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
UNK: Drumroll.
Chandler : All right.
UNK: Help!
Chandler : Am I a Mark or a John?
UNK: You're not tall enough to be a Mark.
Joey : But you might make a good Barney.
UNK: Look, I am serious.
UNK: Tomorrow at 3 : 30, I'm going to the courthouse.
UNK: You're going through with this?
UNK: This name has held me back my entire life.
UNK: It's why kids picked on me and why I never do well with women.
UNK: So tomorrow, I'll either be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
UNK: You've got problems because of you, not your name!
Phoebe : This has got to stop! Chandler is a great name.
Phoebe : In fact...
UNK: I'm sorry, I know you wanted me to name the baby Joey.
UNK: I'm going to name the baby Chandler.
UNK: Really?
Phoebe : But you have to keep the name too.
Chandler : Okay, thanks!
UNK: You want to hug it out?
UNK: I'm going to go tell Frank and Alice right now!
Chandler : Bye, Pheebs!
Ross : -Nice luggage. -I was going to say.
Ross : I missed you too.
UNK: -Thanks, I had a great time. -So did I.
Ross : No tongue.
