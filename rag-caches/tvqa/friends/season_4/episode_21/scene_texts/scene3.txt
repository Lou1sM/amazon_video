UNK: It's just showed me how much you've grown, you know?
Rachel : I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.
UNK: She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
UNK: I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
Rachel : But if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective.
Ross : We were on a break!
Rachel : You seem to really like her.
UNK: What do I do? We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
Ross : No commitment.
Rachel : That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
Rachel : ...asking to hear stories about you...
Emily : ...looking through Monica's photo albums.
UNK: You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
Ross : You think?
UNK: You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
UNK: And you're sitting here in a hallway...
Rachel : ...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross : -You're right. -Yeah.
UNK: This is so amazing!
UNK: My brother's getting married and in London!
UNK: It's so romantic.
Joey : Hey, pretty smart!
Joey : Tissue paper.
UNK: You're at the wedding. You have to cry.
UNK: Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation.
UNK: Isn't this adorable?
Phoebe : Ross let Ben address mine.
Phoebe : Did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding?
UNK: No.
UNK: Don't worry, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
UNK: I'm so jealous you're all going.
UNK: I never knew you can't fly in your third trimester.
UNK: I didn't, either.
Joey : I knew that.
UNK: So I didn't know that. But you should see your faces.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: Just hanging out.
UNK: What's this? Ross' wedding invitation?
UNK: Maybe that's the one we should have hidden.
Rachel : No, you guys, come on. You don't have to do that.
UNK: I'm happy for him.
Rachel : I am. I really
UNK: I'll work on it.
Ross : I'm sorry.
UNK: You're going to come, though, aren't you?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"?
UNK: -I bought my ticket. -You're not even invited.
Monica : You know what would be real weird? If you weren't there.
UNK: -Just say you'll think about it. -I'll think about it.
Rachel : -Who's this from? -That's Ross'.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Rachel : He remembered.
Phoebe : Remembered what?
UNK: It was months ago. We were walking by this antique store.
UNK: I saw this and told him it was like one my grandmother had...
Rachel : ...when I was a little girl.
Rachel : I can't believe he remembered!
UNK: This must've cost a fortune.
Monica : I can't believe he did this.
UNK: Remember when he fell in love with Carol...
UNK: ...and got her that expensive crystal duck?
Rachel : What did you just say?
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: -We were in school together. -We haven't seen each other since.
Ross : I land in China. Guess who's in charge of the dig?
UNK: Julie!
Rachel : Isn't that great?
UNK: Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
