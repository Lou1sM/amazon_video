Rachel : I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.
Rachel : And I'm really happy for you...
Rachel : ...and your cat.
UNK: Obviously, I am over you.
Rachel : I am over you.
Rachel : And that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Ross : I got a message from you.
Rachel : Oh, my God! Hang up the phone!
Rachel : Give me the phone!
Ross : You're over me?
Rachel : Oh, God.
Ross : You're over me?
Ross : When were you...
Ross : ...under me?

UNK: Did you say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place?
Ross : I'm sorry.
Gunther : Was I not supposed to?
UNK: You ended it!
Rachel : Because I was mad at you. Not because I stopped loving you.
Ross : You still love me?
Ross : What does this mean? Do you want to get back together?
UNK: Maybe.
UNK: I don't know.
Rachel : I just, I feel...
UNK: I can't believe I even thought of getting back together. We're so over!
Ross : Fine by me!
Rachel : And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common.
UNK: It doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal.
Chandler : I knew it!
