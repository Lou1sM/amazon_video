UNK: Mrs. Geller : Rachel's coming up. Doesn't she look pretty?
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Monica : This is us getting ready for the prom.
Ross : We don't have to watch this.
All : Yeah, we do!
Rachel : Come on!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : -Get a shot of Monica. -How do you zoom out?
UNK: Mr. Geller : There she is!
Monica : Shut up! The camera adds 10 pounds.
Chandler : So how many cameras are actually on you?
Monica : Dad, turn it off!
UNK: Mr. Geller : It is off.
Rachel : Right, Ross?
UNK: Looking good, Mr. Kotter!
UNK: I can't go to my prom without a date. It's too late.
Monica : If you're not going, then I don't want to go either.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : I have a wonderful idea.
UNK: Mrs. Geller : You should take Rachel to the prom.
Ross : We've seen enough. Let's turn it off.
UNK: -I want to see! -Fine, I'm not going to watch.
UNK: Come on, kid. Let's go.
UNK: Are you handsome!
UNK: Let's show them!
Ross : -Okay, Dad. -Rachel, ready or not.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Here comes your knight in shining
UNK: Mrs. Geller : Oh, dear!
UNK: Mrs. Geller : How do I turn this off?
UNK: I can't believe you did that.
Chandler : Yeah, well...
Phoebe : See? He's her lobster!
UNK: No.
UNK: You're really not going?
UNK: It's just going to be too hard.
UNK: You know, I mean...
UNK: ...it's Ross.
Rachel : How can I watch him get married?
UNK: It's just for the best. You know? It is.
UNK: Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.
UNK: She's going to be pretty big by then.
UNK: She'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.
Rachel : Drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor.
UNK: You don't have a car.
Monica : And your license expired.
UNK: There's so much to do, and I have so little time!
Chandler : Check this out.
UNK: There's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums.
UNK: "It's almost as good as being there."
UNK: It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear.
UNK: You could, but just the one time.
Joey : We could get videos of the sights...
Joey : ...get a VCR in our hotel room and never have to go outside!
UNK: -If we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard. -I bet the British version is good!
