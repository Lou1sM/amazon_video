UNK: All of a sudden, so much is happening.
Joey : I know. Ross is getting married.
UNK: Phoebe's making people.
UNK: -Everybody's doing stuff. -We just sit here.
UNK: If I died, people would know I was here...
UNK: ...only by the ass print on this chair!
UNK: -What are we doing? -Wasting our lives.
UNK: I meant for lunch.
Chandler : We have to do something. Something huge!
Joey : We could climb Mt. Everest.
Chandler : Not something stupid. Something huge!
Joey : I saw an ad for this video.
UNK: People climb that thing every day. We could totally do that!
Chandler : Why not? I mean, it's just climbing.
UNK: -It's just steep! -Yeah.
UNK: We're going! It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: -We're gonna climb Mt. Everest. -Yeah, baby!
Phoebe : I looked into that.
UNK: Yeah, but it costs like $60,000, and, you know, you could die.
Phoebe : And you would die.
Joey : We could get that Everest video.
Chandler : We could do that without risking our lives at all.
UNK: While we're at the video store, we could rent Die Hard!
Joey : I just remembered.
Joey : That Everest thing is only available through mail order.
UNK: So you'll stay here and hang out with me?
UNK: But one of these days...
UNK: ...we'll get off our butts and rent Die Hard again!
UNK: The One with the Invitation
