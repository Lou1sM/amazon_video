UNK: Monica, Joey, And Phoebe : Down on creation
UNK: Monica, Joey, And Phoebe : And the only explanation I can find
Rachel : Listen, missy! If you want this cart, you'll have to take me with it!
Rachel : -Did you see that? -You were incredible!
UNK: A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Rachel : I could not have done this without you.
Ross : More clothes in the dryer?
Ross : I'm fine.
Ross : You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me.
Ross : I was doing great with Julie before I found out.
UNK: I was doing great too. It's not easy for me to see you with Julie.
Ross : I don't need this right now.
Ross : It's too late.
Ross : I'm with somebody else. This ship has sailed!
UNK: All right, fine! Go ahead and do that.
Rachel : I don't need your stupid ship!
UNK: This is the first time I'm doing something I care about.
UNK: I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.
UNK: If you don't get that
UNK: I get that, but I'm tired of your answering machine.
UNK: I don't know what to do.
Rachel : Neither do I!
Ross : Is this about Mark?
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: Okay, it's not.
UNK: I can't keep having this same fight over and over again.
UNK: You're making this too hard!
Rachel : I am? What do you want me to do?
UNK: I don't know. Look, maybe we should just take a break.
UNK: You're right. Let's cool off.
UNK: Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
Rachel : A break from us.
UNK: -Why are we rushing? -The girlfriend I told you about.
Ross : She wants to get back together with me.
Ross : I found it!
UNK: That's so great for you guys!
Chloe : -Good luck with your girlfriend. -Thank you.
Rachel : -You got my message? -You are right on time.
Rachel : Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ross : You can very much.
Rachel : I want you to leave. Get out!
UNK: I want to talk about this.
Rachel : All right, how was she?
UNK: -What? -Was she good?
UNK: Don't answer!
Rachel : You wanted to talk about it. How was she?
Ross : She was...
Chandler : -She was not good, not good. -Nothing compared to you.
Ross : She was different.
Rachel : Good different?
Ross : Nobody likes change.
UNK: Just stop!
Rachel : The way you owned up to everything.
