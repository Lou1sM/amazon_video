UNK: That was fast. It usually takes me hours to get Ben to go down for his nap.
UNK: He's such a sweetheart. Do you know what he said?
UNK: -Good night, mommy. -That's because he has lots of mommies.
UNK: Yeah, in fact, it's kind of become his word for "woman".
UNK: So does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Rachel : Oh, God! Nobody likes him.
UNK: He's so cheap. He'd never fly to London in a million years.
Ross : Invite him!
Ross : Did I do these neat enough?
UNK: Yeah, they're fine.
UNK: We'll say that Ben addressed them.
Emily : You invited Rachel then?
Ross : Sure, why not?
UNK: Really?
UNK: I wouldn't be comfortable having any of my old lovers there.
Ross : Do you think we shouldn't invite her?

UNK: But it's absolutely your decision.
Emily : -More tea? -Sure.
Emily : Earl Grey?
Ross : Fine, invite whoever you want.

Chandler : And I just want a million dollars!

Ross : You did?
UNK: I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.
Rachel : I did.
Ross : Listen, do you think
Ross : Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor.
UNK: Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime?
UNK: Maybe.
Ross : Okay, maybe I will.
Ross : See, I see...
Ross : ...big passion in your future.
UNK: -Really? -I do.
Rachel : Ross, you're so great.
Joey : It's never gonna happen.
Ross : I have a question.
Ross : Actually, it's not so much a question.
UNK: It's more of a general wondering...
UNK: ...ment.
UNK: Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to...
Ross : Yes, yes.
Ross : That's right.
UNK: Look!
UNK: What?
UNK: Monica, Joey, And Phoebe : Top of the world looking
