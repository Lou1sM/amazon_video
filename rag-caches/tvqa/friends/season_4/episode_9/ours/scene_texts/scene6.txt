UNK: We're 29. We're not women.
UNK: There you are.
UNK: I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
UNK: Okay, I'm hearing.
UNK: I've been doing a lot of thinking.
UNK: I came up with a bunch of businesses that you can do with your van.
Monica : You could be a flower delivery person.
UNK: -What? -Or a bakery delivery person?
UNK: Pizza?
UNK: I got a whole bunch of stuff in this area.
UNK: But I get the feeling you don't want to deliver.
UNK: -No. -Okay.
UNK: I guess if you don't want to deliver...
UNK: ...you probably don't want to pick up stuff either.
UNK: No.
Joanna : You know what?
UNK: Let's do the catering business.
Phoebe : -Really? Are you sure? -Yeah, I made a commitment to you.
UNK: It'd be fun.
Phoebe : It will be fun!
UNK: Let's plan the wedding reception.
Phoebe : You really wanted me to do something with this van.
Joanna : You know what? I want you to take the chef job.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah.
UNK: That's what you really want.
UNK: I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy. I'd be unhappy.
UNK: And I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: Besides, it might be kind of fun to form the new A-Team.
Rachel : Hi, Mrs. Lynch.
Rachel : Is Joanna in already?
UNK: Mrs. Lynch : Oh, my goodness! You haven't heard.
Rachel : -Heard what? -Joanna...
UNK: Mrs. Lynch : ...passed away last night.
Rachel : Oh, my God! How?
UNK: Mrs. Lynch : She was leaving work, and she was hit by a cab.
Monica : Oh, my God! I cannot believe it!
Joey : I know.
Rachel : Oh, God. Oh, God.
Rachel : Oh, God.
UNK: I didn't realize that you were so close.
Rachel : Yes. So close!
Rachel : I know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.
Rachel : But by any chance, did Joanna...
Rachel : ...send any paperwork your way before...
Rachel : -...it happened? -No, nothing.
UNK: Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Rachel : Yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us.
Rachel : Nothing about an assistant buyer?
UNK: I'm sorry. I have to go.
Sophie : Good morning!
UNK: I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.
Sophie : I sure did!
UNK: I'm excited about having Monica on board with us.
Allesandro : Although I do feel bad about having fired Chef Emilio.
UNK: It is like losing a member of the family.
Allesandro : Of course, that literally is the case for several of you.
Allesandro : Tony, Carlos, Marie...
Allesandro : ...please tell your father how much we're going to miss him.
UNK: I know Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place.
Allesandro : Well, you all read the review.
Allesandro : So without much further ado...
Allesandro : ...I present to you our new head chef.
UNK: I just want to say that with a pinch of excitement...
Monica : ...a dash of hard work and a dollop of cooperation...
Monica : ...we can have the recipe...
UNK: Are you going to kill me?
