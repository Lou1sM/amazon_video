UNK: ...then go down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
UNK: I'm kind of beat.
UNK: Actually...
Chandler : ...me too.
Joey : Are you serious?
UNK: Thank God! I'm exhausted.
Gunther : You guys want coffees?
UNK: I don't want to be up too late, so I'll have a decaf.
Ross : Yeah, me too.
UNK: Actually, could I get some hot water with lemon?
Chandler : I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
UNK: I can't hear a word. My ears are ringing so bad.
UNK: I was glad I had that extra pair of socks.
Ross : I used them as mittens.
UNK: I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
Ross : How sad are we?
Joey : Yeah, I know.
Joanna : You know what? We're not sad.
UNK: We're just not 21 anymore. You know?
UNK: I'm 29 years old, damn it!
Chandler : I want to sit in a comfortable chair, watch TV...
UNK: ...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.
Joey : I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Ross : And so what if I like to go home, put on Kenny G and take a bath?
