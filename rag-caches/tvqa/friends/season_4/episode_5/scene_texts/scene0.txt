UNK: Joe, I don't think a four-letter word for "ship" can be "ship."
UNK: I thought it was a freebie.
UNK: Hello!
Ross : What's this?
Ross : Oh, right! It's that girl's phone number.
Ross : There it is. Just a phone number...
Ross : ...a really hot girl gave me.
Ross : It's no big deal. I mean, it is her home phone number, but...
Ross : Almost lost this baby!
Ross : The lovely Amanda gives me her number, and I go and drop it.
Phoebe : Thank you.
Gunther : -When's your birthday? -May 5th. Why?
UNK: I'm making a list of birthdays.
Ross : -Mine's December -Yeah, whatever.
Chandler : She's pretty!
UNK: Pretty, pretty girl. The pretty She's pretty.
UNK: Go ask her out.
UNK: -What's the worst that could happen? -I could die.
UNK: Yeah, it's tough being single.
Ross : That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Rachel : Ross, you guys went out once.
UNK: You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
Chandler : I tell people secrets.
Chandler : It makes them like me.
UNK: All I'm gonna say is, finally, it's nice to be in a mature relationship.
UNK: You know, the world would be such a better place...
UNK: ...if that actually was all you were gonna say.
UNK: Phoebe.
Monica : You're sick. You shouldn't play. Go home.
Phoebe : But I'm unemployed.
Phoebe : My music is all I really have now.
Phoebe : Well, music and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
Chandler : All right, I'm gonna do it.
UNK: I'm gonna go get shot down.
Chandler : Any advice?
Monica : Just be yourself...
Monica : ...but not too much.
Chandler : Wish me luck.
Ross : Good luck!
Chandler : Wish it!
Chandler : I was just sitting over there and...
UNK: My name's Chandler. Did I say that?
Kathy : No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
UNK: -Kathy with a K or a C? -With a K.
Kathy : Wow, you are really good at this!
Chandler : I'm out on a limb here!
Kathy : I'm sorry. You're right.
Kathy : But I should tell you, I'm waiting for a date.
Kathy : And there he is now!
Joey : I see you guys already met.
UNK: I was trying to demonstrate...
Chandler : ...how I could get my very large feet...
Chandler : ...into my even bigger mouth.
UNK: Didn't I tell you?
UNK: Always showing off.
UNK: Before I start, I want to say that I have a cold.
UNK: So if I sneeze during a song, it's not on purpose.
Phoebe : Except the last verse of "Pepper People."
Phoebe : Smelly cat, smelly cat
Phoebe : What are they feeding you?
Phoebe : This chick sounds good.
Phoebe : Smelly cat
Phoebe : Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
UNK: At 2 : 30 a.m., I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
