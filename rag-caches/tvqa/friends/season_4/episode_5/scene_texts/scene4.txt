UNK: Her date tipped me $10!
Kathy : What are you doing?
UNK: I want to be sexy again, so I'm trying to catch a cold.
Phoebe : Should be easy. They're pretty common.
Monica : You'll catch pneumonia!
Chandler : Okay, you were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
UNK: -What? -Are you serious?
Phoebe : How is that possible? You barely know her.
UNK: I don't know. I just
Chandler : I can't get her out of my head.
Chandler : I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person.
Chandler : I'm a horrible person.
UNK: "No, you're not. We still love you, Chandler!"
Monica : Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
Phoebe : You mean you stole it!
Phoebe : Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Kathy : We were just talking about you.
UNK: Really?
Joey : The time you got drunk and fell asleep...
Joey : ...with your head in the toilet.
Chandler : Right in there!
UNK: -What movie did you get? -I got what I always get.
UNK: Die Hard.
UNK: That's what I like about Joey. Any other guy would have been :
UNK: "Yeah, The English Patient is my favorite movie too."
UNK: But Joey goes, "No way. Let's get Die Hard.
UNK: I'm not watching that English crap."
UNK: Yeah, he's dreamy.
UNK: I gotta go. I gotta go meet some friends.
UNK: He has other friends?
UNK: Ninety-nine...
UNK: ...a hundred. Ready or not, here I come!
Chandler : Let's go over the concept one more time.
UNK: You want to get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
UNK: You know what? I already ate.
UNK: It's 4 : 30.
Chandler : I had a big meal on Monday.
UNK: So that'll get me straight through the week.
Joey : I see what's going on here.
Phoebe : -You do? -Yeah.
Joey : You don't like Kathy.
Chandler : You got me.
Joey : You've been avoiding her ever since we started going out.
Joey : I made an effort to like Janice.
Joey : Now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out with us. Right?
Chandler : -Yeah, right. -Good. And hey, my treat.
UNK: -Only because you're not eating, right? -Right.
UNK: Sorry, Grandma.
Monica : Ross isn't here.
Rachel : Stop it!
Josh : I'll see you at the party?
UNK: Beer's fear, man! Twenty-four, seven!
UNK: I am so gonna marry that guy.
