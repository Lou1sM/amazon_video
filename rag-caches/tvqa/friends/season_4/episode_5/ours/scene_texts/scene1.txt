UNK: Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs thing I wanted to watch.
Chandler : That's why I got up too.
Kathy : You're kidding? I love him!
UNK: My dad made me stay up and watch reruns with him.
UNK: Mine too. Did your dad also make you watch the Mr. Universe contest?
UNK: -No. -Well, me neither.
UNK: I'm sorry about this afternoon. If I had known that you two, I never would have...
Kathy : Oh, please.
Chandler : Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Kathy : They teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do.
Kathy : All of them had us making out.
UNK: That's a good thing because he used to make me rehearse with him.
Chandler : -Is it on? -No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing!
Chandler : Oh, my God!
Chandler : It's on!
Chandler : Here we go, little fella.
Kathy : What about the duck?
Chandler : The duck can swim.
Phoebe : My sticky shoes
UNK: My sticky, sticky shoes
UNK: Why you stick on me?
UNK: Baby
Phoebe : Thanks for the lights, honey.
All : Way to go!
UNK: Your cold makes you sound great.
Phoebe : It's fun. God, I love how sexy I am!
Joey : Kath, we should get going. We're going to buy hamsters.
UNK: I love them.
Kathy : No, it's not like that. I work for a medical researcher.
Rachel : -Well, have fun. -Okay.
UNK: It's nice that the medical community...
UNK: ...is trying to help sick hamsters.
UNK: -Isn't it? -Yeah, it's great.
UNK: You know what? I like Kathy.
Chandler : Me too! She's so cool and pretty.
UNK: She is.
Chandler : She's smart and funny.
Chandler : We were up all last night talking. She said the funniest thing about
UNK: What?

Ross : He's a little sensitive right now because he's so in love!
Chandler : All right.
Monica : Kathy, I love you!
Phoebe : I need to write some depressing stuff to go with my new bluesy voice.
Phoebe : But nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Monica : How about your mom dying?
Monica : Or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Phoebe : I could write about the time my hair did that whoo-hoo thing.
Ross : I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.
Monica : Rachel's not here.
Monica : How's it going with her?
Ross : Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight may be the night.
Ross : The kids are gonna play together, and then when they're asleep...
Ross : ...I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine...
UNK: ...do a little playing ourselves.
Rachel : Hi, guys! This is Josh.
Rachel : Josh, these are my friends.
Rachel : And that's Ross.
UNK: Dudes.
UNK: You played in college?
Josh : I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity.
UNK: Didn't you play soccer in high school?
