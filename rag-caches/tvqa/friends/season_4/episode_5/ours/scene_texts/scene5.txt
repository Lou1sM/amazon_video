Rachel : -I think he's stealing from me. -Why?
Rachel : Because he's stealing from me!
Phoebe : Hi, it's me...
Phoebe : ...and soup.
UNK: I just saw Josh. He looked so yummy in your leather jacket.
Phoebe : I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup.
Phoebe : There's no chicken in the broth, so it's really just noodle water.
Monica : -Thank you so much. -Sure.
Kathy : What are you doing?
Phoebe : I need your germs. I want my cold back.
Phoebe : I miss my sexy voice.
Monica : Sorry, Phoebe.
Phoebe : It's okay.
Phoebe : How's the soup?
Kathy : Check it out! You can see that girl's underwear.
