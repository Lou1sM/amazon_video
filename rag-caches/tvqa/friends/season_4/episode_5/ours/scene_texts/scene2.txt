UNK: No, wait. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
UNK: It's getting late. I gotta get to the game, so I'm gonna...head.
Rachel : I'll miss you.
UNK: Dope!
Phoebe : Wow! Cute one.
UNK: -Very cute. -I know. Isn't he great?
Rachel : So nice to finally be in a fun relationship, you know?
Rachel : There's nothing boring about him.
Rachel : I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Ross : Maybe he'll get to go soon.
Ross : Like on a class trip or something.
UNK: You know what else is great about him?
UNK: What is the word for an adult...
UNK: ...who doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Rachel : What was that?
Ross : Monica knows.
Monica : It's this dumb thing that Ross made up to try to fool our parents.
Monica : It's a way of giving the finger without actually having to give it.
UNK: I cried the night you made that up.
UNK: It was the first time I realized I was cooler than my big brother.
UNK: I'm going to go get ready...
Ross : ...for my date tonight...
UNK: ...so I'll just "head."
UNK: I should go too. I'm playing in one hour.
Phoebe : You guys should come hear me.
Phoebe : Hear me.
Phoebe : My sticky shoes
Phoebe : I lost my sexy phlegm!
Amanda : Hi, Ben.
Ross : -You look great! -Thanks.
Ross : Hey, Tommy!
Amanda : I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
UNK: Oh, no. It's my pleasure.
Amanda : My cell phone number is here on the counter.
Amanda : Please, help yourself to anything in the fridge.
UNK: I appreciate this so much. I have been trying to go out with...
UNK: ...this guy for a month.
UNK: I'd really appreciate it if you'd wait and drink your wine...
Amanda : ...after the kids are asleep.
UNK: I blocked the adult channels for the other babysitters, but the code is four, three
UNK: I'm fine.
Amanda : Thanks for this. I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Ross : Who wants to make some long-distance calls?

UNK: Kathy! Kathy!
