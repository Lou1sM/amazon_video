Rachel : I know queen is high!
Joey : Not as high as...
Joey : It worked! King!
Monica : We pick again! We pick again!
UNK: -Why? -I don't know.
Chandler : Tickets, please.
Chandler : Courtside, baby!
Joey : Seriously, good game, though. Good game.
Joey : What are they so mad about? They got the apartment back.
UNK: No, they didn't.
Emily : Packed while you were gone.
UNK: I left knickers under your pillow.
Chandler : Move in with me?
UNK: What?
UNK: Don't be scared. It sounds crazy, and people will say it's too soon...
UNK: ...but just think. Think how great it would be.
UNK: I don't know.
Emily : Leaving London...
Emily : My whole family lives there...
Emily : -My job. -You'll get a job here.
UNK: I always hear about them foreigners stealing American jobs.
Ross : That could be you.
UNK: Yeah, but it's my whole life.
Emily : You come to England.
Ross : I would. I really would. But my son is here.
UNK: I can't leave him. You don't think there's any way?
UNK: I don't think so.
Emily : It would be different if it was way into the future...
Emily : ...and we were getting married.
UNK: What?
UNK: Right. I shouldn't have said "married." Please don't go freaky on me.
UNK: I didn't mean it. I take it back.
UNK: No. Don't.
UNK: Why don't we?
UNK: Why don't we what?
Ross : Get married.
Emily : You are mad!
UNK: No, I'm not! It's perfect. It's better than you moving here.
UNK: It's us together forever, and that's what I want.
UNK: -We've known each other six weeks! -I know.
UNK: So what? Who's to say? Does that mean we can't do it?
UNK: Look. I was with Carol for four years before we got married...
Ross : ...and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian.
Ross : I mean, this...
Ross : This makes sense for us.
Ross : Our first date, we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont.
Ross : I mean, last night I got my ear pierced. Me!
Ross : This feels right.
UNK: Doesn't it?
UNK: My parents will be really mad.
UNK: Are you saying, "Yes"? Is that "Yes"?
UNK: Yes.
Emily : -We're getting married! -Oh, my God!
Emily : We're getting married!
Ross : Come here, come here.
Ross : Emily, will you marry me?
UNK: It's a bit small.
UNK: Damn! I thought that'd be romantic as hell.
Emily : It was.
Chandler : Those were, like, the best seats ever!
UNK: Should we give these to the girls? Like a peace offering?
