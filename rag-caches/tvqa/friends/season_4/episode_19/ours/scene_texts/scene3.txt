Chandler : No, thank you.
UNK: Wait, wait. Come on, come on! Let's trade.
UNK: The timing's perfect! I just clogged the toilet!
UNK: I want those seats. But we can't live in the small apartment...
UNK: ...after living here! Ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Joey : Ever read Sports Illustrated?
UNK: No, I didn't read yours!
Joey : We can go to the game tonight!
UNK: The only way I'll consider this is...
UNK: ...if they offer more than just season seats.
UNK: -It's the Knicks! -Screw the Knicks!
UNK: I didn't mean that. I just meant that...
Chandler : ...the apartment is worth so much more.
Chandler : And the Knicks rule.
Joey : Yeah, the Knicks rule!
UNK: So? Are you going to do it?
UNK: No, we're not going to because it's not an even trade.
Joey : All right, look.
Rachel : What if you could keep the apartment and the tickets?
UNK: Done!
UNK: Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet. Winner takes all.
UNK: We could get nothing.
UNK: Or everything.
Joey : I like that.
Monica : What do you say?
Monica : Just do it!
UNK: Oh! I'm convinced!
Joey : Come on, man! You know I'd do it for you.
UNK: Because you're my best friend.
UNK: All right. But you can't use that again for a whole year.
UNK: I'm in.
Phoebe : This is so exciting! What are you going to bet?
Rachel : We should let Phoebe decide...
UNK: ...because she's the only one who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Phoebe : I have a game!
Phoebe : -This is great! -What's the game?
UNK: It doesn't have a name. No, okay. Phoebe Ball!
UNK: No, it doesn't have a name.
UNK: What is your favorite thing about trees?
UNK: -They're green? -Good! Five points!
Phoebe : Same question.
UNK: -They're tall. -Three points!
Phoebe : Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy. Leafy.
UNK: That's not even a game.
UNK: Shut up. We're winning!
UNK: You want to finish this? We get a deck of cards.
Monica : High card wins. What do you say?
UNK: -Let's do it! -Oh, I have cards!
Phoebe : Yeah. Here.
Phoebe : No, these are the trick deck.
Phoebe : Here, yes.
UNK: Okay, you guys pick first.
UNK: -Four. -That's a low one!
Emily : You look. I can't do it.
UNK: What makes you think I can?
UNK: Ace!
UNK: Why are you hugging?
Monica : We won our apartment back!
Joey : What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
Monica : No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
UNK: I don't know.
Phoebe : Look it!
UNK: Come on, pick again!
Rachel : Come on, apartment! Come on, apartment!
