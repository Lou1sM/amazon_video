Chandler : What the hell is going on?
Rachel : We took our apartment back!
Phoebe : I had nothing to do with it.
Phoebe : Okay, it was my idea. But I don't feel good about it.
Chandler : We are switching back right now.
UNK: No, we're not. We're not leaving!
UNK: You'll have to. You both have jobs.
UNK: As soon as you do, we'll switch back! You can't stop us.
Phoebe : -Right, Joe? -I don't know.
UNK: What?
UNK: I don't want to move again, with...
Chandler : This is our apartment and they stole
Chandler : You stole!
Rachel : Our apartment! We won it fair and square. Twice!
Chandler : And I am getting it back right now! I'm getting it back right now!
Joey : All right.
Rachel : We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Chandler : No more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Rachel : -Let us keep the apartment and -As a thank you...
Monica : ...Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Chandler : -Totally worth it! -That was one good minute!
Chandler : Good night.
Monica : -Men are such idiots. -I know.
UNK: Can you believe something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
UNK: If you had just done that after the last contest...
Phoebe : ...no one would have had to move at all.
UNK: Let's pretend that's not true.
UNK: Scarf's done.
Joey : Come on, come on!
UNK: What's going on?
Joey : Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Ross : Emily and I, we decided...
Ross : ...to get married.
UNK: What?
