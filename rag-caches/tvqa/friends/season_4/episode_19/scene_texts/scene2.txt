UNK: You have tickets?
UNK: Mom got Dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she gave them to me.
UNK: Apparently, they're good seats.
Joey : Oh, my God! Those are almost on the floor!
UNK: I could slip Woody Allen my resume.
Rachel : Do you guys want these?
Chandler : Yeah, we do!
UNK: Well, you got them!
Rachel : Just give us our apartment back.
UNK: Oh, I didn't see that coming.
Chandler : Are you serious?
UNK: The Singing Man : Come on. We know what these are worth.
UNK: Do you think we're stupid?
Joey : Not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
Monica : What do you say?
UNK: Forget it. I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for basketball seats.
UNK: Your "bachelor pad"?
UNK: Have you even had a girl here?
UNK: No.
Chandler : But Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning.
Joey : Yeah, you do!
UNK: The Singing Man : Come on!
Chandler : Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Gunther : Good one.
UNK: The Singing Man : Come on. Season tickets!
Rachel : Season tickets! You know what that means?
UNK: I'm not giving up the apartment.
UNK: When I was a kid, my dad's company gave season tickets...
UNK: ...to the No. 1 salesman every year. My dad never won.
UNK: Of course, he wasn't in sales. But still, I never forgot that!
Monica : Hey guys!
Joey : Oh, my God!
UNK: We don't make enough fun of you already?
Phoebe : Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.
Chandler : You do know that Wham broke up?
UNK: I like it. Emily likes it. That's what counts.
Ross : So, how are you guys doing?
UNK: Don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
UNK: Where's Emily?
UNK: She's saying goodbye to her uncle.
UNK: Didn't she, like, just get here?
Chandler : Easy, tiger.
UNK: I just hate this so much.
Ross : Every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's so great.
UNK: But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back in a couple of days, dropping her off."
UNK: -So what'll you do? -There's nothing to do.
Ross : She lives there. I live here.
UNK: She'd have to move here.
Ross : She should move here.
UNK: What?
UNK: -I can ask her to live with me. -Are you serious?
Ross : -I mean, why not? -You've only known her six weeks!
UNK: I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with.
UNK: Look, guys, when I'm with her, it's like...
UNK: She brings out this great side of me.
UNK: I mean, I love her, you know?
Chandler : And I love the milk!
UNK: But I won't ask some British girl to move in with me.
Chandler : Joey, you say things now.
UNK: Look, Ross. He's right. Emily's great.
UNK: She's great!
UNK: But this is too soon. You'll only scare her.
UNK: I don't want to do that.
UNK: You don't want to wreck it. Don't go too fast.
UNK: No. You're right. I know, you're right.
UNK: I'm not going to do it.
Ross : -Thanks guys. -No problem.
Chandler : Just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
UNK: It's too hard. Too hard!
Joey : All right. Last chance for the tickets.
UNK: Otherwise, I give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
