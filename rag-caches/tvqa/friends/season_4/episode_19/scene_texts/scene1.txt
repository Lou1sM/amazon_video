Rachel : I hate this apartment!
UNK: I hate this wall color! I hate that it still smells like bird!
Rachel : I hate that singing guy!
Joey : Are you kidding? I love that guy!
UNK: Morning's here
Rachel : Stop it!
Rachel : I will kill you.
UNK: I hate that my room is so small.
Monica : I have all the space I need. Do what I did.
UNK: You don't even have a bed. You sleep in a ball on the floor!
UNK: I am tired of your bellyaching.
UNK: I've worked hard to make this a nice place for us.
Ross : I know. I'm so sorry.
UNK: I'm sorry, okay?
UNK: It's a great apartment!
Monica : Shut up! This place is a hole!
UNK: I still can't believe you've got an earring!
Ross : I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowie?
Emily : He does that?
UNK: I don't know. Whatever.
Emily : I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Ross : Oh, I know.
Joey : You know what?
UNK: I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you.
UNK: When I'm with you, I'm like...
Ross : ...this whole other guy. I love that guy!
Ross : I mean, I love you too. A lot.
Ross : But that guy!
Joey : I love that guy!
Emily : I love both of you.
UNK: I wish I didn't have to go.
UNK: Then don't.
Ross : Stay here. Don't go so soon to London.
Ross : Just one more day.
UNK: Please don't do this to me again.
UNK: I'd stay, but I've already missed so much work. They'll fire me.
UNK: So? Then you could stay as long as you want.
Emily : I wish I could.
UNK: Oh, no. Don't start packing.
UNK: The Singing Man : Come on!
UNK: I don't think you understand packing.
UNK: I don't want to leave it till last. Last time, I left my knickers here.
Ross : Yeah, I know. I tried them on.
UNK: You didn't!
UNK: No, I didn't. I didn't want to be "that guy."
Phoebe : Excuse me?
Chandler : Your pants.
UNK: Oh yeah! You like them?
UNK: I went to a used-clothes store and got maternity stuff.
UNK: These are so comfortable.
UNK: Pheebs, those are Santa pants.
Phoebe : Santa pants.
UNK: Santa Claus' pants.
UNK: No. They're maternity pants.
Phoebe : They even came with a list of baby names. See?
Phoebe : These names are good, and these are bad.
UNK: Hey, Phoebes.
Rachel : So, how are the elves?
UNK: I don't know. How are the...you know?
UNK: Your clothes aren't funny.
Monica : What should I wear to a Knicks game?
Chandler : A T-shirt that says, "I Don't Belong Here"?
