UNK: My mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth mom.
UNK: I found a dried-up seahorse.
UNK: What do you mean?
Phoebe : My new mom, who's a big fat abandoner.
UNK: Don't you want to stay here and talk about it?
Phoebe : I need to be alone.
UNK: Man. Hey...
UNK: ...what if you found out that your mom wasn't really your mom...
UNK: ...and your new mom turned out to be really hot?
UNK: Oh, man, huh?
UNK: But, it's your mom.
UNK: No, I'm talking about your mom.
UNK: It's over.
Rachel : Was it awful?
UNK: It was long.
UNK: I didn't realize how late it was...
UNK: ...till I saw the five o'clock shadow on her head.
UNK: She didn't want to stay. I called a cab. She just left.
Rachel : I wrote you a letter.
UNK: Oh, thank you!
Ross : I like mail.
UNK: It's just some things I've been thinking about. About us.
UNK: Before we even think about us getting back together...
UNK: ...I need to know how you feel about this stuff.
UNK: It's 5 : 30 in the morning.
UNK: So I'd better get cracking on this baby.
UNK: I'll be waiting for you. Come up when you're done.
UNK: I'll be up...
UNK: ...in 18 pages.
Ross : Front and back.
Ross : Very exciting!
Rachel : What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
UNK: Done.
Rachel : -You just finished? -I wanted to be thorough.
Ross : This is clearly very important to you. To us.
Ross : I wanted to read every word carefully.
UNK: Twice.
Rachel : Does it?
UNK: I'm sorry?
Rachel : Does it?
Rachel : Does it? Does it?
Ross : I wanted to give that whole "Does it?" part another glance.
UNK: What do you mean? You said you read it twice.
UNK: It either does or doesn't. If you have to think
UNK: No, I don't have to think about it.
Ross : In fact...
UNK: ...I've decided. I have decided...
Ross : ...that it...
UNK: ...does.
Rachel : -Are you sure? -Sure, I'm sure!
