Joey : We have to get it out. It's eating me alive!
Joey : -Monica got stung by a jellyfish. -All right!
Monica : I got stung.
Monica : Stung bad.
UNK: I couldn't stand.
UNK: I couldn't walk.
Chandler : We were two miles from the house.
UNK: We were scared and alone.
UNK: We didn't think we could make it.
Monica : I was in too much pain.
Joey : And I was tired from digging.
Chandler : Then Joey remembered something.
UNK: I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.
UNK: Wait, I saw that.
Joey : On the Discovery Channel. About jellyfish and how if you
Ross : You peed on yourself?
UNK: You can't say that! You don't know!
UNK: I thought I would pass out.
UNK: I tried, but I couldn't...
Monica : ...bend that way.
UNK: That's right. I stepped up.
UNK: She's my friend and she needed help.
Joey : If I had to, I'd pee on any of you.
UNK: Only...
UNK: ...I couldn't.
Joey : I got the stage fright.
Joey : I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure.
UNK: So I turned to Chandler.
Chandler : Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now. Do it. Do it now!"
Chandler : Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the screaming.
UNK: Because I do it through my wall to freak you out.
UNK: Maybe there's somebody you guys could talk to.
UNK: Oh, who?
UNK: It's not like they have a group for people like us.
UNK: Yeah, no, there's this guy Owen, he's the best.
UNK: Might have his card.
UNK: And fuchsia and mauve
UNK: Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom
UNK: I invite all of you to count the colors in your bedroom.
Phoebe : Except for you. You go away.
UNK: I'll go in a second.
UNK: I just want to tell you...
UNK: ...there wasn't a day I didn't regret giving you up.
Phoebe : Okay, bye.
UNK: I'm not done.
UNK: The reason I never looked you up was because...
UNK: ...I was afraid you'd react...
UNK: ...just like the way you're reacting now.
UNK: Can't we just start from here? Please?
UNK: No.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : One last thing.
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : You came looking for family.
UNK: I'm family.
UNK: I'm it.
UNK: Now I'm done.
UNK: It's not like we're losing anything.
UNK: I guess you're right.
UNK: It's not like we know each other or have anything in common.
UNK: I don't know. It's not like...
UNK: ...we don't have anything in common.
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : I mean, I like pizza.
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : I like pizza!
UNK: Wait, I like the Beatles.
Rachel : Oh, my God! So do I.
UNK: Puppies. Cute or ugly?
