UNK: Phoebe Sr. : So cute!
UNK: You see?
Rachel : My mom never thought this would work out.
UNK: She said, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
UNK: I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
Rachel : But if time was what you needed to gain a little perspective...
Ross : We were on a break!
UNK: -Coffeehouse? -You bet.
Ross : It took two people to break up this relationship.
UNK: You and that girl, which yesterday you took full responsibility for.
UNK: I didn't know what I took responsibility for.
UNK: I didn't finish the letter.
Ross : I fell asleep.
Rachel : You fell asleep?
UNK: It was 5 : 30 in the morning.
UNK: And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
Ross : Front and back!
UNK: By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means "you are."
UNK: Y-O-U-R means "your."
UNK: I can't believe I thought of getting back with you! We are so over.
Ross : Fine by me!
UNK: Those spelling tips will be handy Saturday nights at home...
Rachel : ...playing Scrabble with Monica.
UNK: Sorry!
UNK: All that sleep you'll miss wishing you were with me!
UNK: Don't worry about me falling asleep.
Ross : I still have your letter!
Rachel : Just so you know, it's not that common.
UNK: It doesn't happen to every guy.
Rachel : And it is a big deal!
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : I knew it!
UNK: Gin.
Chandler : We were playing gin?
Chandler : If we were a couple, we could play naked.
UNK: -Would you stop? -Okay. All right.
Chandler : All right.
UNK: I think you're great.
UNK: I think you're sweet and smart...
Monica : ...and I love you.
Monica : But you'll always be the guy who peed on me.
