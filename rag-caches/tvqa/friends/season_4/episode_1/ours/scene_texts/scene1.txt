UNK: She's helping me. My head's sunburned.
Bonnie : -Thanks a million. -You're welcome a million.
UNK: Smell it.
UNK: Minty.
UNK: I'll be in our room.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Ross : I know.
UNK: I got to go.
UNK: I got to go break up with Bonnie.
Rachel : Here? Now?
UNK: I can't stay here all night.
UNK: If I go in there, she'll want to...
Ross : ...do stuff.
UNK: Can't you say you aren't in the mood?
Ross : No, she likes that.
UNK: Faking sleep doesn't work.
UNK: I've woken up many times with her
Ross : -Why am I telling you? -I don't know.
UNK: -Not every morning -Making it worse!
UNK: The One with the Jellyfish
UNK: You probably want to know how it happened.
Phoebe : I think I can figure it out.
UNK: I was born, and then everyone lied their asses off.
UNK: No, it wasn't like that.
UNK: Remember how I said Lilly, Frank and I were close?
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : We were very close.
Phoebe : How close?
UNK: The three of us were kind of a couple.
UNK: I don't know how that would work.
UNK: I'm not asking!
UNK: Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : ...and I was...
UNK: ...scared. I was stupid and selfish...
UNK: Phoebe Sr. : I was 18 years old. Remember what it was like to be 18?
Phoebe : Mom killed herself and my dad ran off.
UNK: I lived in a Gremlin with a guy who talked to his hand.
UNK: I'm sorry. I thought I'd left you with the best parents.
UNK: I didn't hear about them till a few years ago.
UNK: By then, you were already grown-up.
UNK: You're here and I would really like to get to know you.
Phoebe : Well, everybody does.
UNK: I'm a really cool person.
UNK: You had 29 years to find out, but you didn't even try.
Phoebe : You walked out on me, and I'll do the same.
UNK: I don't ever want to see you again.
UNK: Where's my purse?
UNK: Shoot! We're out of soda.
UNK: -I'll get you some. -Really?
UNK: No, because I'm not your boyfriend.
UNK: Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?
