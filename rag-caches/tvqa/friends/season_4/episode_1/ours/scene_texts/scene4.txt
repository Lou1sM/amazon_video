Monica : Are you?
UNK: That's so great!
Phoebe : Not for Bonnie.
UNK: But for you, yea!
Rachel : -How was the beach? -Nothing. I don't know.
Joey : -What happened? -Nothing.
UNK: -I'm going to shower. -Me too.
Chandler : Me too.
UNK: I'll put this in the car.
Rachel : I have to go pack!
UNK: -And it really does? -It does.
Ross : It really and truly does.
Ross : It so does not!
Ross : She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong.
Ross : She goes on for five pages about how I was unfaithful to her.
Ross : We were on a break!
Chandler : If you say that one more time, I'll break up with you.
Ross : This breakup was not all my fault. She says here...
UNK: ..."If you accept full responsibility...
Ross : ...I can begin to trust you again.
Ross : Does that seem like something you can do? Does it?"
Chandler : You have what you want. You're back with her.
Chandler : If you bring this up now, you'll wreck it.
Ross : Yeah, I know. You're right.
UNK: I'll let it go.
UNK: But you know how hard it is to forget this?
UNK: Sure, it's hard...
UNK: ...but you don't have to talk about it.
UNK: A lot happened on that trip...
Joey : ...that we should never, ever talk about.
UNK: What happened on that beach?
UNK: It's between us and the sea, Ross.
Phoebe : Hi, Ursula.
UNK: I know that we haven't talked in a long time.
Phoebe : Our mom is not our birth mom. This other lady is our birth mom.
UNK: Right, the one that lives in Montauk.
Phoebe : You know her?
UNK: No. I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
Phoebe : There was a suicide note? Do you still have it?
Ursula : Hang on.
UNK: I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note.
Ursula : Yeah, so how have you been doing?
Phoebe : Shut up!
UNK: "Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you.
UNK: P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."
Phoebe : You just wrote this!
UNK: It's pretty much the gist.
Ursula : Except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Ursula : All right. Hang on.
Monica : Pass the cheese, please.
UNK: You can't even look at me, can you?
UNK: It's Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!
UNK: I'm too depressed to talk.
UNK: I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.
UNK: What about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Rachel : What happened out there?
Monica : What? We took a walk. Nothing happened.
UNK: I came back with nothing all over me.
Joey : What happened? Joey?
Chandler : All right.
UNK: We swore we'd never tell.
UNK: They'll never understand.
