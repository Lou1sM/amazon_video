Chandler : Would you go out with me?
UNK: I've got canned goods.
Joey : Take a look at this!
Joey : Check this baby out! Dug me a hole.
Chandler : Excellent hole, Joe.
UNK: Oh, no! My hole!
UNK: My foot!
Joey : What is it?
Monica : Jellyfish sting! It hurts!
UNK: Can we help you to the house?
UNK: It's two miles.
UNK: And I'm tired from digging.
Monica : Damn the jellyfish!
Monica : Damn all the jellyfish!
Chandler : Do something.
UNK: There's only one thing.
Joey : What is it?
Joey : Pee on it.
UNK: Gross!
UNK: I saw it on Discovery Channel.
UNK: He's right. There's ammonia in that...
UNK: ...that kills the pain.
Monica : Forget it. It doesn't hurt that bad!
UNK: You can use my hole for privacy.
UNK: I'm ready to get the hell out of here.
