Chandler : I just wanted to come over to say that I'm sorry.
Chandler : I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.
Chandler : I can completely understand why you were so upset.
UNK: I really wish you'd called me.
UNK: Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.
Chandler : I think this is a good thing.
UNK: We've had our first fight, and now we can move on.
UNK: I know for me, but
UNK: Nick's pants?
Chandler : I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Joey : -For next time, what do you say? -"I have an extra ticket."
UNK: "An extra ticket." Not "two tickets."
UNK: The first time you asked a guy out he turned you down?
UNK: He didn't turn me down. He's at the game.
Rachel : I got the date. I'm just not on it.
UNK: Okay, it's ready.
Chandler : -Come on. -What's ready?
Monica : Just come.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Ross : This is beautiful!
Phoebe : Did you work for two days straight?
Monica : Pretty much.
Monica : What do you think of the floor?
UNK: I don't know. Looks the same.
Monica : You used to have carpet.
UNK: Kathy's Co-star : Oh, yeah.
Monica : I made snacks.
Monica : Please, just hang out.
UNK: I'm just gonna rest my eyes for just a little bit.
Ross : Do you want us to come back later?
UNK: No, no, no. Stay. Just keep talking.
UNK: I'm always the hostess.
UNK: How'd it go?
UNK: -She wasn't sleeping with him. -Good!
Chandler : She is now.
Ross : -What are you saying? -I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
UNK: You think you know a person, then they turn around and sleep with Nick.
UNK: Nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.
Chandler : I hate him. And I hate her.
UNK: I don't hate her. I love her. This is all my fault.
UNK: How? How is it your fault?
UNK: I should have called.
UNK: If I had called her, she never would have gone out with Nick.
UNK: They wouldn't have ended up in bed. I threw her at his man-nipples!
Rachel : This is not your fault.
UNK: Your fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.
UNK: Well, if she thought they were on a break...
UNK: Mr. Waltham : Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Mr. Waltham : -Will you call him? -Yes, I will. Absolutely.
Rachel : Hello, Rachel.
Rachel : Hi, Joshua.
Rachel : -I left my wallet here on purpose. -Really?
Rachel : Yes. I just wanted to see you again.
UNK: I'm glad.
UNK: Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.
UNK: Yes?
UNK: "How you doing?"
