UNK: Hi.

UNK: I'm Rachel Greene. What could I do for you, Joshua?
Joshua : I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife Well, my ex-wife
UNK: I'm so sorry.
Joshua : Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.
UNK: I got away with this suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
UNK: Well, at least that's a great suit.
UNK: It wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.
Joshua : I need everything down to underwear. If you're willing, I'm all yours.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Mr. Waltham : You needed to speak to me?
UNK: No, no, that wasn't me.
Rachel : We should get started. Let me show you my underwear.
Rachel : The selection of underwear that we carry.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: -It's this way. -This way? Sorry.
UNK: I'm right. Right? There was no chemistry between them.
Chandler : Before, they had heat. Now, there's no heat.
Chandler : You know what this means. Joey told us what this means.
UNK: Let's not jump to any conclusions. There was some sexual chemistry.
Chandler : Come on. It was like cousins having sex.
UNK: Here she comes. Don't say a word. Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.
Kathy : Hey, you guys!
Kathy : Thank you so much for coming again.
Kathy : -Did you like it tonight? -Absolutely.
UNK: Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
UNK: It's a good play, isn't it?
Chandler : I loved the play. You were great.
Chandler : And Nick, ditto.
UNK: Clearly, you're having sex with him.
UNK: Okay...
UNK: Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Chandler : It was so obvious. There was no chemistry between you two.
UNK: You're accusing me of cheating on you, and you're insulting my performance?
UNK: I can see how this could happen. You're up there every night naked, touching, kissing.
Kathy : Acting. Chandler, this is my job.
UNK: I'm playing a part in a play. How can you not trust me?
Chandler : You can understand, given how we started.
UNK: I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
Chandler : That is what happened. I don't even see you denying this.
UNK: I'll tell you what, Chandler. You call me when you grow up.
UNK: Don't expect that to happen any time soon!
Rachel : I have the best job in the entire world!
Rachel : The most adorable guy came over, and I got to dress him up all day!
Phoebe : Rachel has a new doll!
UNK: I wish he was a doll. I'd get a Rachel doll and bump them together...
UNK: ...and make kissing noises.
UNK: He's got the most beautiful name. I never realized. Joshua.
UNK: Joshua.
Rachel : Joshua. Josh.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Hi.
