Phoebe : What do I smell?
UNK: I don't know. It smells good.
Monica : Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.
Monica : Please, have some.
UNK: I've been fiddling around here, making delicious treats for everyone.
Joey : The new Playboy.
Monica : Just something I picked up.
Ross : Cookies and porn? You're the best mom ever!
UNK: What?
UNK: It's just something Joshua said about V-necks, but you had to be there.
Ross : How does Jason look in a V-neck?
UNK: -It's Joshua. -Whatever.
UNK: Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout!
Phoebe : -Hate to eat and run. -No, wait. Please, don't go!
UNK: I've got porn for you too.
UNK: I don't need it.
UNK: People are supposed to want to hang out here.
UNK: Why? What is the big deal?
UNK: I'm the hostess.
Monica : Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.
UNK: Even when I was little, the girls brought their dollies to my tea party.
Monica : I served the best air.
UNK: Why'd you make a big thing out of everyone hanging out in the big apartment?
Monica : 'Cause they took our apartment. I wanted to punish them.
UNK: I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
Phoebe : If you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here.
UNK: That is true.
UNK: This place is gonna be 10 times better than that place.
Phoebe : Are we gonna trash their place?
UNK: There's steps!
UNK: Slut!
Chandler : You'll all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
UNK: -What? -You were right?
Chandler : I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.
UNK: I don't live here!
UNK: Wait, are you sure?
Chandler : I may be drunk, but I know what she said.
Chandler : Then I went over to Beefsteak Chewley's...
UNK: -Beefsteak Charlie's? -Yes!
Kathy : You and I have always been like :
UNK: Man, I am so sorry.
UNK: The bartender taught me a trick, though.
UNK: I don't remember it.
Rachel : -Do you need help with that? -I got it.
Rachel : I just feel bad. I never vacuum.
Rachel : I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
Rachel : -Just so frustrating. -Why don't you ask him out?
UNK: Totally. That's such a turn-on.
UNK: Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
UNK: That's the turn-on.
Phoebe : He just got a divorce. Right? He's probably really nervous around women.
UNK: Maybe you just need to make the first move.
UNK: -I've never asked a guy out before. -You've never asked a guy out?
Rachel : No. Have you?
Phoebe : Thousands of times!
UNK: That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?
UNK: I don't even know how I would go about it.
UNK: What I do is, I look a woman up and down, and I say...
UNK: ..."Hey. How you doing?"
Phoebe : Oh, please!
UNK: Hey. How you doing?
