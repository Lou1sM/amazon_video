UNK: You know what? I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna call him up and ask him out.
Rachel : I can do that, ask him out.
UNK: "How you doing?"
Rachel : Hi, Joshua. It's Rachel Greene from Bloomingdale's.
UNK: I was just wondering if you...?
Kathy : If you...
Rachel : ...left your wallet at the store today?
Rachel : We found a wallet, and we
UNK: The license? That is a good idea.
UNK: Well, let's see. This license belongs to...
UNK: ...belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.
Rachel : So sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
UNK: -You've done that a thousand times? -I've never done that.
Rachel : I just got so nervous that he'd say no.
Joey : You gotta give him something he can't say no to, like...
UNK: ...Knicks tickets. Invite him to a Knicks game. You're guaranteed he'll say yes.
Rachel : -Really? You think that'll work? -Absolutely. And if not, can I go?
Joey : What the heck is that?
Chandler : Did she call?
Phoebe : No. Sorry.
Chandler : Maybe I should call her.
UNK: Forget her, man. You don't need her.
UNK: He's right. What she did was unforgivable.
UNK: Well, yeah, but, you know, what if I was wrong?
Ross : How might you be wrong?
UNK: What if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
UNK: Tell me she told you this.
UNK: She didn't have to tell me. I saw the play. There was no heat.
Chandler : -Back me up. -That's all you're basing this on?
UNK: That's not backing me up!
Chandler : Look, you said, "With the offstage and the heat"
UNK: That was just a theory. There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out :
Joey : Lone gunman, communism, geometry.
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: "Would you like to go to a basketball game with?"
UNK: "It's funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets"
UNK: "Who likes the Knick?"
Joshua : What do you think?
Rachel : Well, as a single woman, who is available...
Rachel : ...I think you look great.
UNK: Oh, yeah. You look great.
Rachel : This looks great.
Rachel : So you like it?
Joshua : I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'll wear it home.
UNK: -Great. -Thank you so much for all your help.
UNK: Well, I guess this is it.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Maybe I'll see you in the spring for the bathing suits.
UNK: You don't want to do that now?
UNK: That's okay.
UNK: I'll see you around sometime.
UNK: Basketball!
UNK: Sorry?
Rachel : I have two tickets to the Knicks game if you're interested...
UNK: ...just as a thank-you for this week.
Joshua : That would be great!
UNK: -Really? -That would be fantastic!
Joshua : My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!
Joshua : This is fantastic. Thank you so much, Rachel.
UNK: Mr. Waltham : Good morning.
