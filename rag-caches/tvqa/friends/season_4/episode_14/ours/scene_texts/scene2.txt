Joey : Oh, my God! I overslept!
Joey : I was supposed to be on the set half an hour ago!
UNK: You can't go like that! You stink!
UNK: I fell asleep. Now I don't have time!
UNK: Just 10 blocks away. If I run, I'll make it.
UNK: Run 10 blocks. That'll help the smell.
Rachel : Slow down! No, keep moving.
UNK: How did it go last night?
UNK: Well, I didn't see Joshua.
Rachel : But I did punch a girl in the face.
Rachel : The whole night was horrible. It was pouring.
UNK: There was no Rachel Greene on the list. But there was a Rachel Greep.
Phoebe : So did you get to meet her?
Rachel : There is no Rachel Greep. But this girl overheard us.
UNK: And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep!" And he let her in.
Monica : So you hit her?
Rachel : No, she was already in.
Rachel : This big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella...
Rachel : ...so I clocked her.
Rachel : All I wanted was a few hours...
Rachel : ...outside of work to see Joshua...
UNK: ...so he could go ahead and start falling in love with me.
UNK: Pheebs.
UNK: Honey, that's your name.
UNK: That's short for Phoebe? I thought that's what we called each other.
UNK: -You're wearing pants! -That's right.
UNK: Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.
UNK: It's 9 : 30 a.m.
Chandler : They got a breakfast buffet.
Chandler : Let me talk to him!
Joey : -Oh, my God! -Can't I just?
UNK: -It's my phone and she's shush -Please!
UNK: What's he saying?
UNK: He's with Emily in Vermont.
Phoebe : What? Oh, my God!
Rachel : Who the hell is Emily? No.
Ross : When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet...
UNK: Who wouldn't be miserable?
UNK: I'm telling you, once I got her into a dry pair of shoes...
Ross : ...she was a totally different person.
UNK: They're in Vermont? How did this happen?
UNK: How'd he end up in Vermont with that witch?
UNK: Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.
UNK: There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard!
UNK: I got to go! There's a deer eating fruit from the orchard!
UNK: He had to go. There was a deer eating fruit from the orchard.
UNK: I don't get this. She was horrible!
UNK: I'm going to go stand over there.
Monica : Why do you care?
UNK: I don't care.
UNK: I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.
UNK: You do not just meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Monica : When you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
UNK: Could you, just for once...
UNK: ...not remember every little thing?
UNK: So you know, when's he getting back?
Monica : A couple of days.
Chandler : I knew something like this would happen.
Joey : What are you doing?
