UNK: You can't go back a phase!
UNK: You're thinking about time. You can't go back in time.
UNK: Why don't you do your phase two strip club thing with us?
Monica : We can be guys!
UNK: No, you can't.
Phoebe : Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys.
UNK: No, you don't. You'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
UNK: Would you just stop being such a wuss and get those off?
UNK: And come with us and watch naked girls dance!
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I'm sorry.
Joey : Joey Tribbiani. I'm here.
UNK: The A.d : Calm down, we got time. We're running late.
UNK: All set.
Joey : Look at that. Charlton Heston eating licorice.
UNK: Yeah, he loves them. I've never seen him with
Joey : What the hell is that? What smells so bad?
UNK: You.
UNK: I could see why you would think that. But you know who it is?
UNK: You?
UNK: No, no. It's Heston.
UNK: What?
UNK: He reeks like he went on a three-day fishing trip, then ate licorice.
UNK: No way. He's the only one with a shower in his dressing room.
Joey : Really? A shower?
Joey : Which room might that be?
UNK: The A.d : The one with "Heston" on it.
UNK: Interesting.
UNK: I got some ones. You want to put them in her panties?
Chandler : No, thanks, Mom!
UNK: That.
Phoebe : You have to put that out because I'm pregnant.
UNK: The Cigarette Smoking Guy : Maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.
UNK: It's not my baby.
Monica : Very good.
UNK: Really good. I enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Rachel : I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call.
UNK: You'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up.
UNK: You know what makes it worse?
Rachel : Ross is all happy in Vermont.
Phoebe : Come on, look where you are!
Monica : Another round of daiquiris.
Phoebe : Virgin for me.
UNK: Don't let me leave without the name of that carpet guy.
Ross : Come on!
Joey : You know what? I'll go home and call Kathy.
UNK: If it'll help.
Chandler : That was a test. In a few hours, I'll be drunk.
UNK: I'll want to call her. You'll have to stop me.
UNK: Then I'll be so drunk, I'll want to call Janice.
Phoebe : You should! How is she?
Monica : I think somebody needs another lap dance.
UNK: Who's in there?
