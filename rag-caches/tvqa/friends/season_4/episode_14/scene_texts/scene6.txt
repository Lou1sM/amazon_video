Phoebe : No, listening!
UNK: Sit.
UNK: Maybe it would really, really help if you would just talk.
Monica : Yeah, come on. What's going on in there?
UNK: And you know, if you want to cry, that's okay too.
UNK: I'm going to have to ask you all to leave.
Chandler : Forget it. We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.
UNK: Those strippers were hot, and I couldn't picture myself with them.
Monica : They really were pretty, weren't they?
UNK: -I liked that fighter pilot one. -Candy?
Monica : She was so spunky!
Monica : I think if I were going to be with a woman...
UNK: ...it'd be with someone like Michelle.
UNK: She was just so petite.
UNK: For me, it would have to be Chantal.
Rachel : She had the smoothest skin.
UNK: I stuck that dollar in her G-string and grazed her thigh
Joey : Phase three! I just achieved phase three!
Chandler : I am totally picturing you with all those women!
UNK: That's not phase three.
UNK: Well, I'm there too!
UNK: Are we all together in a group?
UNK: Stop it, you're killing me!
UNK: I think I moved on to phase four!
Phoebe : -What is that? -I don't want a relationship ever!
UNK: I just want sex with strippers and my friends!
Ross : Come on.
Chandler : Let me see that smile.
UNK: I don't want to.
UNK: Please?
Joey : I wanted to go to the strip club!
UNK: You'll have plenty of chances.
UNK: There are thousands of women out there, just waiting to screw me over.
Joey : Yeah, all right.
Phoebe : How was Vermont?
Ross : Emily is...
UNK: ...incredible. There are no words to describe her.
Ross : The whole weekend was like a dream.
Ross : And you! Rach!
Ross : You were so right.
UNK: What?
Ross : What you said about us finally being in a place...
UNK: ...where we could really be happy for each other.
UNK: I admit, I wasn't quite there.
Ross : The thought of you and that Josh guy
UNK: Joshua.
UNK: Joshua guy at that club, dancing, having a good time.
UNK: And the thought of it kind of...
UNK: You know? But now!
UNK: But now, I'm totally there.
UNK: I'm finally where you are.
Emily : Thank goodness!
Ross : And thank you for Emily.
Rachel : No problem. I'm so glad I could help, you know?
UNK: I'm happy for you.
Rachel : Happy for you.
UNK: Oh, no, happy for you.
UNK: All right. Here's what we'll do.
UNK: You are going to take off my clothes.
Chandler : You two, go get the oils.
Chandler : And you, just constantly scream...
UNK: ..."Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
UNK: I want to be with her. I like her.
UNK: That's fine. Go with your instincts!
Monica : What am I doing again?
Chandler : Pay attention. I could wake up at any moment.
UNK: I'm Joshua. I'm here to pick up Rachel.
UNK: That's not Joshua.
Chandler : What do you want from me? I never met the guy.
UNK: I'm sorry you can't stay.
Chandler : The rest of us have a lot of work to do.
Joey : What are you doing?
Chandler : All right, listen. I got to wake up.
