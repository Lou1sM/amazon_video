UNK: Wow, and I can't resist that line. That's why I never wear sweatpants.
UNK: Did you catch any fish?
Joey : You guys have no idea.
Monica : -You stink! -Are you kidding?
UNK: Three days without a shower. Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!
UNK: How's he doing?
UNK: He hasn't left that chair in two days.
UNK: Hey, buddy, how's it going?
UNK: You see? He just needed his pal to come home.
UNK: I got to memorize my lines.
Joey : Me and Charlton Heston, bright and early tomorrow, baby!
UNK: What's the matter?
Rachel : Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
Rachel : But I already told Mr. Waltham...
Rachel : ...that I would take his niece to the dumb old opera.
UNK: So, what are you going to do?
UNK: -I don't know. -No! Help me!
UNK: -I can't. I have to work. -Phoebe?
Phoebe : I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Phoebe : Unless she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Rachel : You guys, come on! I have to meet Joshua.
UNK: It's my one chance for him to see the "fun" Rachel.
UNK: The "wouldn't it be great if she were my wife?" Rachel.
Rachel : Are Joey and Chandler back?
UNK: Chandler's still in phase one, and Joey's that thing you smell.
UNK: So...
UNK: No.
Ross : Come on!
UNK: -She's here. -Wait, wait.
Rachel : Ross, please?
Ross : You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera...
Ross : ...so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy?
Ross : That is a toughie.
UNK: She's looking down the hall.
Monica : She looked right at me.
UNK: You can't see people through that hole, can you?
UNK: I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please.
UNK: I thought we had moved on.
UNK: I thought we could be happy for each other.
Rachel : I mean, was that just me?
UNK: All right, I'll do it.
UNK: Mr. Waltham : Thank you, thank you.
UNK: Emily. I'm Rachel Greene.
Emily : Thank goodness!
UNK: There's been a teeny change of plans. I'm not free tonight
UNK: Really?
UNK: I must've missed your call, though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Joey : Well, I
UNK: That's not rude. It's in keeping with the trip...
UNK: ...where I've been run down by one of your wiener carts...
Emily : ...and been strip-searched at the airport.
UNK: Apparently, I look like someone who's got cocaine stuffed up their bum.
Monica : I think you look great.
Emily : Good night. It was very nice to meet you.
UNK: I'll get her.
Ross : Please, hurry.
UNK: Don't you just love the way they talk?
UNK: -What? -The baby kicked!
Joey : Oh, my God.
UNK: No, wait. The elastic in my underwear busted.
