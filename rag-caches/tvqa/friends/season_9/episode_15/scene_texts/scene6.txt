UNK: That's interesting.
UNK: Just one thought : You didn't mention the shoes.
UNK: Who's next? Chandler.
UNK: You start with a guy putting on the shoes.
Chandler : -He's about my age. -Your age?
UNK: He's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.
UNK: Maybe he falls. Maybe he hurts himself.
UNK: Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.
UNK: He jumps over the old guy and laughs. And the line reads :
UNK: ''Not suitable for adults.''
UNK: -Well, Chandler, that's great. -Thank you, sir.
UNK: Or, man who's two years younger than me.
Boss : You see, that has a clear selling point. lt appeals to our key demographic.
