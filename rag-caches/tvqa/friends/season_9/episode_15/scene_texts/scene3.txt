UNK: -How'd the audition go? -They want to see me again, but...
UNK: ...Leonard Hayes did not like me.
Monica : -What happened? -He said l wasn't urgent enough.
UNK: Everything l did was horizontal, and l should be more vertical.
UNK: -He said that l should think less. -Well, so far so good.
UNK: Honey, l'm old!
UNK: l didn't know you were coming home for lunch.
UNK: -Can l get you anything? -Sure, a tube of Polident?
UNK: Some Depends?
UNK: Birthday wishes from Willard Scott.
Monica : What's wrong?
UNK: l am so much older than these other interns. l can't compete with them.
UNK: So you're a little older.
UNK: Look at the positive. You have all this life experience.
UNK: Yes, but l don't think life experience is gonna help me with these.
UNK: Wow! lt's like they're on fire!
Monica : -What are they? -Prototype sneakers.
UNK: l need ideas on how to sell them. Which l can't do...
Chandler : ...because no self-respecting adult would ever wear these.
UNK: l'll give you $500 for them.
UNK: -What am l supposed to do? -Come on, sneakers are easy.
UNK: -You wear them all the time. -They're not called sneakers anymore.
UNK: They're called ''kicks'' or ''skids.'' l think l heard somebody say ''slorps.''
UNK: They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom so you can roll around...
UNK: ...because apparently walking is too much exercise.
UNK: ''Kids! Kids! Roll your way to childhood obesity!''
UNK: Kids today have such an easier time getting fat.
UNK: Would you help me try to sell these?
Monica : Okay. Have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
UNK: That's not what they're looking for.
Joey : Hey, that would work on me.
UNK: Why do you think l buy Mrs. Butterworth's?
Ross : You'll never guess what just happened.
UNK: -Phoebe and l got mugged! -Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.
Monica : How do you know a mugger?
UNK: l'm sorry, l have friends outside the six of us.
Ross : Know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.
UNK: Seriously?
UNK: Well, l'm not proud of it, but, you know...
UNK: ...when l was living on the street and l needed money for food and stuff....
Monica : -That is awful. -l wasn't rich like you guys, okay?
UNK: l didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.
UNK: l had a hard life. My mother was killed by a drug dealer.
UNK: -Your mother killed herself. -She was a drug dealer.
UNK: lt was a good thing she knew him. l was about to do some serious damage.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.
UNK: -Why? -Ross was mugged as a kid.
Intern : -You were? -Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.
UNK: lt was outside St. Mark's Comics.
