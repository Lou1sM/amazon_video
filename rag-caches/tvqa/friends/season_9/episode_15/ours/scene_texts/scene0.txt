UNK: Guys! Guys! l've got great news. Guess what.
Joey : -Monica's pregnant! -Really?
Monica : Let's get past the moment.
Phoebe : -What's your news? -Thank you.
UNK: l got a job in advertising.
Monica : Honey, that's incredible!
Phoebe : Gosh, what's the pay like?
Phoebe : Oh, come on, people.
UNK: lf l don't know who makes the most...
UNK: ...how do l know who l like the most? Hi, Joey.
UNK: lt pays nothing. lt's an internship.
UNK: We have interns at Days of Our Lives.
Chandler : Right. So it'll be the same, except less sex with you.
UNK: What do you think they'll have you do there?
UNK: lt's a training program, but they hire the people they like.
Phoebe : -That's great! -There's gonna be some grunt work...
UNK: ...which will stink. A grown man getting people coffee is humiliating.
Chandler : Humiliating and noble.
Chandler : Thank you.
UNK: You know, if l didn't already have a job...
UNK: ...l would've been good in advertising.
UNK: Ross, you did not come up with : ''Got Milk?''
UNK: Yes, l did! l did!
UNK: l should've written it down.
UNK: Where's Chandler? l want to wish him good luck on his first day.
UNK: And l smelled bacon.
Monica : -He just left. -Who did?
UNK: Joey, you're never gonna believe it! She called!
Joey : -She did? -You got it!
UNK: -l did? -What is she talking about?
UNK: l don't know, but it sounds great!
Rachel : Your agent called. You got that audition!
UNK: -With Leonard Hayes? -Yes!
Joey : Oh, my God, that is great! lt's for a play on Broadway.
UNK: And in a real theater. Not that little one underneath the deli like last time.
UNK: -ls it a good play? -lt must be.
UNK: l read it and didn't understand a single word!
UNK: -Leonard Hayes is starring in it. -Yeah, and directing.
Monica : He was so good in that movie of Macbeth.
Rachel : -You saw that? -No, but l saw the previews.
UNK: They played it right before Jackass.
Joey : -He's done some amazing work. -Oh, yeah.
UNK: l loved him in those phone commercials.
Joey : When the monkey hits him in the face with the giant rubber phone....
Monica : Maybe the monkey will be at the audition.
Joey : Don't make me more nervous than l already am!
Chandler : -Good morning. -Can l get you a cup of coffee, sir?
UNK: Oh, no, no. l'm an intern, just like you guys.
Chandler : Except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that l can rent a car.
Intern : Seriously, you're an intern?
UNK: l'm heading in a new career direction and you gotta start at the bottom.
UNK: Dude.
