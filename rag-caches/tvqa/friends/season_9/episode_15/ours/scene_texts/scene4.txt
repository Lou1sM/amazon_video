UNK: l was minding my business, seeing what kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.
UNK: Wonder Woman.
UNK: Anyway, l was heading towards this bakery...
UNK: ...to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone...
UNK: ...when out of nowhere, this thug with a pipe jumps out and says :
UNK: -''Give me your money, punk!'' -Oh, my God.
UNK: l know. And the worst part was, they took my backpack...
UNK: ...which had all the original artwork l did for my own comic book, Science Boy.
Monica : Oh, yeah! What was his super power again?
Ross : A super-human thirst for knowledge.
UNK: l better get to class.
Ross : Are there any more of your friends l should look out for?
UNK: No. Actually, you might want to stay away from Jane Street.
Phoebe : That's where Stabby Joe works.
UNK: -l think we have a problem here. -What?
Phoebe : Back in my mugging days, l worked St. Mark's Comics.
UNK: -Yeah? -A pipe was my weapon of choice...
UNK: ...and preteen, comic-book nerds were my meat.
UNK: So?
UNK: There was one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said :
UNK: Phoebe And Monica : -''Geology rocks!'' -''Geology rocks!''
Joey : -Oh, my God! -l know! l mugged Ross!
Receptionist : -You're late. -l know. l'm sorry.
UNK: But can l just run to the bathroom?
UNK: -No. Leonard doesn't wait. -But l am bursting with Yoo-hoo!
Lennart : Joey, here we go! Let's go. Very quickly.
UNK: -l really need-- -We must go now, quickly.
UNK: -Yeah. Yes, sir. -Ready?
Lennart : -What the hell are you still doing here? -l think you know!
Lennart : -Oh, you sick bastard! -l am what you made me! Know what?
UNK: -What? -l could go right now.
Lennart : -Then go. Go! -Oh, l can't. l want to, but l can't!
Lennart : Cut. That was good!
UNK: -Very good. You did everything l asked. -l did?
UNK: Yes. Plus which, you've got this, l don't know, this squirmy quality...
UNK: ...you bring to the character l couldn't have imagined.
UNK: Here's what we're gonna do :
UNK: Come back tomorrow for the final callbacks.
UNK: Do all of this, what you got going now. But you know what?
UNK: More. More. Can you do that?
UNK: Sure. l don't have time to say thank you because l really gotta go!
UNK: Look at that! Still in character. l like him.
UNK: l plant seeds. l can't explain it. l don't know.
UNK: -Hey. What are you doing? -Putting on the sneakers...
UNK: ...to get in the young mindset, see if it sparks anything.
Rachel : -Oh, anything yet? -Yes, how's this?
UNK: ''They're so uncomfortable, it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''
UNK: You're probably wondering what l'm doing.
Monica : No, that seems about right.
UNK: Yesterday at my audition, l had to pee. Apparently, that makes me a good actor.
UNK: l got a callback, so l'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way...
UNK: ...that eggnog in our fridge was great!
Rachel : -Joey, that was formula. -We gotta get more of that.
UNK: These aren't half bad. You should suggest these to Ralph Lauren.
Rachel : Okay, first of all, that's stupid. Second, l'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
UNK: All right. l feel younger already.
UNK: Yeah, l think l broke my hip.
Ross : -Hey, you! -Hey.
Phoebe : Hey. How was class?
