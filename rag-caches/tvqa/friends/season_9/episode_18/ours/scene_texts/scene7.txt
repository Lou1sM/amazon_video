UNK: l'm not used to getting these from guys.
Chandler : -Hey, Steve. -Chandler, hi.
UNK: l'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions.
UNK: We felt that with your maturity and experience...
UNK: ...you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
UNK: l'd love to be somebody's assistant. Answering phones...
Chandler : ...getting coffee, l live for that stuff.
UNK: And l'm not too mature. Farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Steve : Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.
UNK: We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
Chandler : Me? That guy who just said, ''butt cracks''?
UNK: Yes, that's right.
UNK: We're excited about the level of sophistication...
UNK: ...you'll be bringing to the job.
UNK: Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it. l'll see you tomorrow.
UNK: What?
UNK: Oh, yeah, l'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
UNK: Congratulations! Oh, sweetie, l'm so proud of you.
UNK: Thanks. Does that mean l get the good loving tonight?
Monica : You bet. No TV or anything.
Joey : -Hey, that is so great about the job. -Thanks, man.
UNK: l'd like to think l had something to do with it.
UNK: -Really? Why? -Well, before with the wishbone.
UNK: l didn't wish we would win the lottery. l wished you'd get the job.
Joey : Oh, yeah?
UNK: Listen, don't tell Monica. She'll rip your heart right out.
UNK: Well, you know what? There was a little part of me...
Rachel : ...that really thought we were gonna win.
Ross : Me too. So much for my dinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.
Phoebe : You guys? What was the Powerball number again?
UNK: -Seven. -We won.
UNK: -What? -We won!
Monica : -Let me see! Let me see! -Don't tear it!
UNK: Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers!
UNK: l know that, but look, we got the Powerball number. We won $3!
UNK: Wow, you think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout?
UNK: l don<i>'t care. l</i>'ve never won anything before. l can't believe this!
UNK: So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do with your $3?
UNK: Well, it's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Ross : You know what? You can have mine.
Rachel : -Me too. -Me too.
Rachel : Me too.
UNK: Well, l guess if everybody else is.
UNK: Hey, guys. So l just called the Powerball hot line.
Joey : -Can you believe it? Nobody won. -l beg to differ.
Gunther : Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier...
UNK: ...and he found a ticket on the street right outside and won $ 1 0,000.
UNK: Again, don't blame the pretty lady.
UNK: lt was not her fault. lt was me, the pigeon.
Phoebe : Seriously, stop staring at her.
