UNK: Chandler's supposed to find out if he's getting a job at his agency.
UNK: But out of 1 5 interns, they're only hiring three.
Joey : -Tough odds. -Yeah.
UNK: lf only it were a sure thing like your 24-state lottery.
UNK: Yeah, look who's coming around!
UNK: Damn it. All right, call me when you know more.
Joey : -Did you get it? -One of the slots got filled.
Joey : -By you? -Sense the tone.
Chandler : -No, that kid Nate got it. -Oh, l hate that guy.
UNK: l mean, come on, kid, pull up your pants!
UNK: Well, there's two spots left, right?
UNK: Yeah. l mean, l want this so much. l wanna get one.
UNK: l want my friend Charlie to get one.
UNK: Except l don't care about Charlie.
Phoebe : -Hey, you guys. -Hey!
UNK: You are not gonna believe this. l just saw my psychic...
UNK: ...and she said l was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
UNK: l thought we could use some extra luck...
UNK: ...so l brought a wishbone home from work.
Ross : A psychic and a wishbone? Guys, give someone else a chance.
UNK: -All right, who wants to do it? -Can l?
Phoebe : Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
UNK: lt's really not fair. Just because we don't eat the meat...
UNK: ...doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses.
UNK: All right. Rach?
UNK: l don't want that turkey smell all over my hands.
UNK: l'll do it! lt'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
UNK: -l hope l win. -Well, it doesn't really matter.
UNK: You're both wishing for the same thing.
UNK: l can't tell you what l'm wishing for, or else, you know, it won't come true.
UNK: Right. But we know what you're wishing for.
UNK: -l can't really say. -l understand.
UNK: But you're wishing for what we think, aren't you?
UNK: l'm not really comfortable with these questions!
UNK: -Please! -Just do it!
UNK: Okay. One, two, three.
UNK: l won! Hey!
UNK: You know what? l'm sure your wish is gonna come true.
UNK: But, you guys, just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp.
Ross : That thing gets hot!
Rachel : Ross, just keep making your jokes.
Rachel : How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
UNK: -You're not gonna win. -l know the odds are against us...
UNK: ...but somebody has to win, and it could be us. And then how you gonna feel?
UNK: We're gonna be like, ''Everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the Cape.''
UNK: And you're gonna be all, like, ''Oh, l can't, guys.
UNK: l'll have to meet you up there. l gotta gas up the Hyundai.''
UNK: Okay, l've heard myself on tape, and l sound nothing like that.
UNK: l can see the headline now : ''Lottery Winners' Friend...
UNK: ...Filled With Regret, Eats Own Arm.''
UNK: Why would l eat my own arm?
UNK: Well, you wouldn't, but we own the paper. We can print whatever we want.
UNK: You know what? l'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
UNK: -Why? -Because l know that you think...
UNK: ...that the lottery is boo-hockey...
UNK: ...but we're all here, and we're gonna watch the numbers and have fun.
UNK: And you're my brother, and l want you to be a part of this.
UNK: You don't have to do that. l mean, l'll pay for myself.
UNK: But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.
Ross : Come here.
Phoebe : Get a room.
UNK: So now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
UNK: -l don't know. l'll probably just invest it. -Calm down.
UNK: Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
UNK: Oh, l'm sorry. Did l say, ''invest it''? l meant, ''Be cool and piss it all away.''
UNK: l know! We should pool all our money and buy the Knicks!
UNK: l don't really care about the Knicks.
UNK: You will when l pick you as starting forward.
