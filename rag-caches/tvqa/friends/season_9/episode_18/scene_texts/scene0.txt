UNK: Monica? Hey, can l borrow the Porsche?
UNK: -Okay. -All right!
UNK: But what is it not?
Joey : A place to entertain my lady friends.
Monica : -And what else is it not? -A place to eat spaghetti.
UNK: Very good. What do you need it for anyway?
Joey : The Powerball lottery is up to 300 million...
UNK: -...and they don't sell tickets here. -So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Joey : Yeah, Connecticut. Not West Virginia.
UNK: Maybe l'll drive you up there. l'd like to buy some tickets myself.
Monica : Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use $300 million.
UNK: Yes, because if l was at my old job, we'd say, ''300 million? No, thank you.''
Phoebe : -Will you get me tickets too? -Yeah, me too.
UNK: -Sure. -l have an idea.
UNK: Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together...
UNK: -...and then if we win, we'll split it. -That's a great idea!
Ross : No, thanks.
UNK: -You don't wanna win the lottery? -Sure l do.
UNK: l also want to be king of my own country...
Ross : ...and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Chandler : -Still on Amelia Earhart? -The woman just vanished!
UNK: Seriously, you don't want in on this?
Ross : No. Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery?
UNK: l mean, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
UNK: But there's six of us, so we'd only have to get struck 7 times.
UNK: l like those odds!
UNK: Seriously, you guys, l can't believe you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.
UNK: l mean, that's such a bunch of boo-hockey.
UNK: l'll ask.
UNK: ''Boo-hockey''?
UNK: Oh, we think Emma's about to start talking...
UNK: ...so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
UNK: So get ready to hear a lot of boo-hockey...
UNK: ...gosh darn it and brother pucker.
Monica : How do you know she's gonna start talking?
UNK: When l talk to her, l almost feel like she understands what l'm saying.
UNK: Kind of like Joey.
UNK: What's that now?
Monica : God, look at all these tickets. lt's so exciting.
UNK: l haven't won anything since sixth grade.
UNK: Pie-eating contest?
UNK: You assume because l was heavy that's the only way l could win something?
UNK: No, l saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Monica : -That was a good day. -Yeah.
UNK: -They're towing your car! -l'm parked in a garage on Morton.
UNK: They're towing a car.
UNK: And l am seeing spots.
UNK: Ross, you don't have Emma! Rachel, you don't have Emma!
UNK: -Where's Emma? Who has Emma? -Joey, relax.
Rachel : My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there.
UNK: -l was? -Yes, and you talked to her.
UNK: -l did? -She dropped off a casserole.
Joey : Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.
Monica : Did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
UNK: Yeah. And then l figured after you win, we can all go out to the balcony...
Ross : ...and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it.
UNK: Don't touch the phone! l'll get it!
UNK: -You think he washed his hands? -Hello?
Chandler : -Hey, Charlie, what do you know? -What's going on?
