Rachel : You would do that? l never get picked!
UNK: l'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
UNK: You won't let me buy the Knicks? l can't believe you're taking this away.
UNK: You're right, it has been your dream for over 1 5 seconds.
Ross : How long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
UNK: l'll take this one too. ''Mommy''?
UNK: Oh, l've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel...
UNK: ...''Mommy'' when we're around Emma.
UNK: Which l now realize we are not.
UNK: l'm hoping that if she hears it enough, it'll be her first word.
UNK: Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ''Daddy'' too.
UNK: l like that, Daddy.
UNK: l was just talking about Rachel.
UNK: ls Daddy getting angry?
UNK: ls Daddy gonna spank me?
Ross : Well, that depends.
UNK: Have you been a bad--? No, l can't.
UNK: Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie. Did anybody else hear?
Chandler : What? Susan got it? How?
UNK: Oh, man, l would've slept with him!
UNK: All right, bye.
UNK: Dude, l'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
UNK: -Well, Charlie's gonna get that. -Hey, don't say that.
UNK: You've got just as good a chance of getting that job.
UNK: He is the boss' son.
Monica : -Come on, lottery! -Yeah!
UNK: -lt starts in, like, 20 minutes. -Okay, here we go.
UNK: We need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we've won.
UNK: So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?
UNK: Okay, how about this :
UNK: We divide them into six groups of 40.
UNK: The remaining 1 0 can be read by whoever finishes first.
UNK: -l have another idea. -l'm sorry, idea time is over.
Phoebe : -Well, are all the tickets in the bowl? -Yeah.
UNK: -What about the ones on the nightstand? -There are no tickets there.
Chandler : Yes, there are. l just saw them a few minutes ago.
UNK: No, you didn't. You must be mistaken.
UNK: -There are 20 tickets on the nightstand. -Chandler, sense the tone.
Rachel : Well, well, well. Look what Mommy found.
UNK: Okay, fine. l bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
Phoebe : The psychic also said that l would be betrayed.
UNK: l can't believe this. l thought we were all in this together.
UNK: -Hey, you just got in five minutes ago! -Three minutes ago!
UNK: l don't know why that's important.
UNK: l was with you the whole time. When did you even get those?
Monica : When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic.
UNK: l'll show you how.
UNK: Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one of your special tickets wins?
Rachel : How are you gonna feel when you win and lose your friends?
UNK: Please. lf l win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me.
UNK: Someone gave me muffins last week, and l couldn't get rid of you for three days!
Rachel : Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
UNK: She's right. You shouldn't have bought tickets just for us.
Chandler : Let me finish.
UNK: However, it doesn't look like l'm gonna get this job...
UNK: ...so l can't afford to have principles. So screw you! The tickets are ours!
UNK: There's the man l married.
Rachel : All right. Believe me, if you win the lottery...
UNK: ...it's the last you're gonna hear from us.
UNK: Fine. Don't be my friends. l'll buy new friends.
UNK: Yeah, and then l'll pay for their plastic surgery so they look just like you!
Ross : You know what? l want my share of the tickets.
UNK: l want my tickets too! And l'm buying the Knicks!
Joey : And Steffi Graf!
UNK: Cool. Then l want mine too! And if l win...
UNK: ...l'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond!
UNK: No. You guys, we gotta keep all the tickets together.
Monica : No. No, we should divide them up...
