UNK: -Did the guy really make that joke? -No, he still kills me.
Monica : Last night he had me laughing so hard, l swear a little pee came out.
Ross : Here goes.
UNK: l can't watch. lt's like firing Elmo.
Ross : Sandy? Hi.
UNK: -Hi. -We....
UNK: We kind of need to talk.
UNK: l'm afraid it's not working out.
UNK: l mean, Rachel and l think you are great with Emma.
Ross : -We just feel-- -You! You feel!
UNK: l just feel...
UNK: ...that the chemistry isn't right. l'm sorry.
Ross : We're more than happy to give you a good recommendation.
UNK: No, that's okay. l had a lot of offers from other families.
UNK: l just picked you guys because...
UNK: -...l liked you the best. -Oh, damn you, Geller!
UNK: Anyway, well l'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Sandy : None at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home.
Sandy : Although, if you don't mind telling me...
UNK: ...what was the problem? Maybe it's something l can work on in the future.
UNK: No, you know, it's nothing you did. lt's my issue.
Sandy : What is it?
UNK: Please?
UNK: You know, l'm just not that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
Sandy : That's fair.
UNK: Although, can l ask, why do you think that is?
UNK: Why? l don't know.
Ross : Maybe because of my father?
UNK: You know, when l was growing up, he was a tough guy.
UNK: You know, and as a kid, l wasn't the athlete l am now.
UNK: l play squash!
UNK: Anyway, l always got the feeling he thought l was too sensitive.
Sandy : That must have been hard.
UNK: lt was hard.
UNK: l remember l was in my bedroom, playing with my dinosaurs....
Ross : Playing and learning.
Ross : And my father walks in and says, ''What are you doing with those things?
UNK: What's wrong with you? Why aren't you outside playing like a real boy?''
Sandy : -But you are a real boy. -l know l am!
UNK: And when it's summer and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?!
UNK: lt's all right. Crying is good. lt lets the boo-hoos out.
UNK: Here comes some more!
UNK: Emma, one day you're gonna grow up and be a big girl, just like your daddy.
UNK: Sandy/grumpus : And what's the one kind of boat that can never ever sink?
Ross : -What kind? -A friend ship!
Joey : Wow! You blow my mind!
UNK: l gotta go.
UNK: -How much do l owe you? -Twenty bucks.
UNK: lt's like the cheapest college ever!
UNK: -l'll see you tomorrow. -Okay, bye-bye, Skadandy.
