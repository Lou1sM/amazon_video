Phoebe : Oh, my God! David!
UNK: -ls this a bad time? -No, it's a great time! Come in!
Phoebe : Wow! Hi!
UNK: Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
David : Just for a couple of days.
UNK: l'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant...
David : ...why it's a positive thing that we've spent all their money...
UNK: ...and accomplished nothing.
UNK: Who cares? lt got you here.
UNK: lt got me to New York. Then l got in a cab at the airport...
David : ...and the guy said, ''Where to?''
UNK: l just gave him your address. l didn't even think about it.
UNK: Where's your luggage?
David : Damn it.
UNK: All right, l'll call the cab company.
UNK: We can call them later. Can you just stand there for a moment?
UNK: Boy.
UNK: There's an old Russian expression that goes :
UNK: Roughly translated, that means :
UNK: ''This thing that l'm looking at : Wow.''
Rachel : Thank you.
Phoebe : You should see me when-- Actually, no, l look pretty good.
Mike : Are you kidding?
UNK: You know, when you don't see someone for a long time...
UNK: ...you build them up in your head, you start thinking :
UNK: ''Come on, don't be crazy, nobody's that beautiful.''
UNK: But, well, you are.
UNK: Well, so are you seeing anyone?
UNK: No.
UNK: l'm just the worst person ever!
UNK: How can l not tell David that l'm seeing Mike?
Monica : Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
UNK: He said, ''Are you seeing someone?'' and l said, ''No.''
UNK: Well, that would've been your window.
UNK: l mean, l don't know. l was looking in his eyes...
UNK: ...and l was just thinking, ''Oh, my God, it's David. David's here.''
UNK: He's so irresistible.
Monica : -Really? The scientist guy? -Really? Chandler?
UNK: Continue.
Phoebe : Then it gets worse...
UNK: ...because l told him l would see him tomorrow night.
UNK: -Phoebe! -l know! Evil!
UNK: l like Mike so much, you know? lt's just going really well. Oh, my God!
UNK: lsn't it ironic that David would show up...
Monica : ...on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Phoebe : Yeah. You know, and given my lifelong search for irony...
UNK: ...you can imagine how happy l am!
Monica : -What are you gonna do? -l mean, l guess l just have to...
Phoebe : ...tell David that nothing can happen between us.
UNK: Unless l don't.
Phoebe : You know, complicated moral situation?
UNK: -No right, no wrong? -You have to tell David.
UNK: l knew l should've had this conversation with Joey.
Chandler : Funniest guy she's ever met.
UNK: l'm funny, right?
Chandler : What do you know? You're a door.
Chandler : You just like knock-knock jokes.
Chandler : Save it for inside.
UNK: So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner State.
UNK: Frankly, l'd sooner be in any other state!
Chandler : And what's with Oklahoma having a panhandle?
Chandler : Can all states have stuff like that?
UNK: Hey, yeah, l'm from the waistband of Wyoming.
UNK: But when l was 7, we headed over to the crotch.
UNK: Was your cabin pressurized?
UNK: And don't get me started on the way the people from Tulsa talk.
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : What's with the word ''y'all''? You know, just two words just pushed together?
