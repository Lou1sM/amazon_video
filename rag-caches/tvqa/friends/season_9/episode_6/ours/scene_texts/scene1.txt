Mike : -This is nice. -l know.
Mike : -You need both hands for that? -Yeah, l kind of do.
Phoebe : Well, how's this?
UNK: Are you sure that's sweet enough?
UNK: Look at you two holding hands.
UNK: ls this getting serious?
Joey : Have you not talked about it yet?
UNK: Am l making you uncomfortable?
UNK: lf you were bigger you'd hit me.
UNK: l'm sorry.
UNK: lt's obviously way too early for us to be having that conversation.
UNK: -ls it? -Maybe not. ls it?
UNK: When l got divorced...
UNK: ...l didn't think l'd feel this way about someone for a really long time.
UNK: Then again, l didn't think l'd meet someone like you. And....
UNK: This may be crazy-soon, but l want you to have this.
UNK: No, not.... That's gum.
Mike : Oh, five bucks! l love it when that happens, you know?
UNK: -You don't know it's there-- -l know. Keep digging.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: lt's a key.
UNK: To be honest, l think l'd prefer the five dollars.
UNK: -lt's to my apartment. -Wow!
UNK: Big step for Phoebe and Mike.
UNK: l don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key....
UNK: -No, l want to. -Thank God.
UNK: Wow. l was starting to think l'd never meet someone that...
UNK: ...l wanted to do this with.
Phoebe : Here you go.
UNK: -This is cool. -lt really is.
UNK: l know it. lt is amazing. These little things open doors!
UNK: So l don't go back to work for another four weeks...
UNK: ...but we would like our nanny to start right away...
Rachel : ...so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
UNK: l think that's really smart.
UNK: Prospective Nanny : The easier we can make the transition for her the better.
Rachel : That's great. Great.
Rachel : -So do you have any questions for us? -Not really.
UNK: All right. Well, thank you so much for coming.
Rachel : -Thank you. -lt was really nice to meet you.
Rachel : -We will call you. -Oh, you know, wait.
UNK: l do have one question.
UNK: Prospective Nanny : Do you guys do random drug testing?
UNK: Boy, we hadn't really thought of that.
UNK: That's cool. But if you do, l'm gonna need three days' notice.
UNK: Okey-dokey!
Rachel : We're never gonna find a nanny.
UNK: Come on, Rach. We will. l promise. We have more interviews.
UNK: Worse comes to worst, we can always reconsider the first one we met with.
UNK: -What, the blond with no bra? -She was blond?
Ross : Just a sec.
Ross : Okay, this one's name is Sandy.
Ross : She's got a degree in Early Childhood Education.
Ross : She worked for her last family for three years.
UNK: Hi. l'm Sandy.
Ross : And she's a little mannish.
