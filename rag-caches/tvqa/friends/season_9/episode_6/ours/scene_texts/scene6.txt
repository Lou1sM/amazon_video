UNK: -Rach, can l see you for a sec? -Yeah. Excuse me.
UNK: Do you realize that man has cried in our apartment three times?

UNK: What kind of a guy makes delicate French cookies?
Ross : They're not even butch, manly cookies with....
UNK: You know, with chunks!
Ross : Well, you know, l don't know what to say.

Monica : -How are they? -Lighter than air, but that's not the point.
UNK: Rachel and l hired a male nanny.
UNK: Really?
Joey : Guys do that?
Joey : -That's weird. -Thank you!
Joey : -That's like a woman wanting to be-- -What?
Ross : -What's the end of that sentence? -Yes. What is the end of that sentence?
Joey : A penis model!
UNK: Anyway, did you tell Chandler that some guy from work...

Joey : Being funny is Chandler's thing. Like Ross' thing is....
UNK: Science?
Ross : Academia? Being a good father?
UNK: -l can't believe he's that upset. -Are you kidding?
UNK: That's like Chandler saying he met someone who was more uptight than you.
