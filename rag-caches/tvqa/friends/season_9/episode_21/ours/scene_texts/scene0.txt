UNK: lt's so weird. How did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?
UNK: -l thought you'd end up kissing Charlie. -l thought l'd end up kissing Charlie too.
Ross : But surprise!
UNK: l missed most of the party.
Chandler : Charlie's a girl, right?
UNK: Yeah, she's this new professor in my department that l did not kiss.
UNK: l don't know why Joey had to kiss her. Of all the girls at the party, God!
Ross : -Why do you care so much? -Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?
Rachel : Because Ross is the father of my child.
UNK: You know, and l want him to hook up with lots of women.
UNK: All l'm saying is, l don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
UNK: l don't know. They seemed to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils.
Phoebe : Wow. Joey and a professor. Can you imagine if they had kids?
Phoebe : And if the kids got her intelligence...
Phoebe : ...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...
UNK: ...those nerds would get laid!
Rachel : All right. So, Ross, you're okay with all this? l mean....
UNK: lt's no big deal. l just met her. l'm fine with it.
UNK: God, l forgot how hot she was.
UNK: l'm gonna get some more coffee.
UNK: -Oh, you know, l'll come with you. -Okay.
UNK: -So a professor, huh? -Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.
Joey : Her mind is totally acrimonious.
UNK: Guess that's not how she used it.
UNK: l feel like l owe you an explanation.
UNK: l don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties.
UNK: l'm....
UNK: Well, l'm kind of embarrassed. l really hope you don't think less of me.
Ross : Think less of you? No. l don't think less of you.
UNK: l mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them.
Ross : Those people who like someone and don't kiss them...
Ross : ...those people are stupid. l hate those people.
UNK: Actually, l'm a little surprised at myself.
UNK: l mean, Joey's so different from the guys l usually date.
UNK: They're all professors, intellectuals. Paleontologists mostly.
Charlie : -You know, very cerebral-- -Yeah, l know the type.
UNK: lf we want to grab a bite before work, we'd better get acrimonious.
UNK: No? Am l getting close?
UNK: -Hey! -Hi.
Phoebe : Hey, you guys. Look what l just got.
UNK: Oh, wow! l love those! Where did you get them?
UNK: l bought them off eBay. They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Rachel : Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.
UNK: Oh, then l overpaid.
Monica : Hey, what's this?
Rachel : Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in SoHo.
Monica : You can't show Phoebe this. She hates those corporate massage chains.
UNK: What, now l can't get a massage?
Rachel : There are so many things that she disapproves of.
UNK: l can't eat veal. l can't wear fur.
UNK: l can't go hunting.
UNK: -Do you want to go hunting? -l would like to have the option.
