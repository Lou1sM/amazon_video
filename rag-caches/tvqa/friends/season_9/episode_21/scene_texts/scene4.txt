UNK: l think it just fell off.
UNK: Hello, ja.
UNK: lt's time for your massage, ja?
Phoebe : Put your face in the hole.
Rachel : A Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
UNK: Okay, then l'm Swedish.
Monica : So, what's your name?
UNK: lt's a normal Swedish name.
UNK: lkea.
UNK: -Wow. What an interesting name. -Yeah.
UNK: -You know, l-- -Time for your scalp massage.
UNK: Wow. l really love your--
UNK: -ls something wrong? -No, it's just....
UNK: lt just feels so good...
UNK: ...lkea.
UNK: Hey, say, you'll know this. What's the capital of Sweden?
UNK: Stockholm.
UNK: Damn. l wish l knew if that was right.
Joey : Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas.
Joey : Monet painted quickly, and usually outdoors...
Joey : ...as his elusive subject was light itself.
Ross : Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
UNK: No, no. My mouth says the words, my brain is thinking ''monster trucks.''
Ross : Now, remember, when you get to the museum...
UNK: ...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y. l just--
UNK: -l wrote that out phonetically for you. -Phonetically?
Ross : Yeah, that means-- We just don't have time for this.
UNK: l gotta say, l'm really impressed you were able to memorize all this so quickly.
UNK: l'm an actor. l can memorize anything.
UNK: Last week on Days, l had to say :
Joey : ''Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.''
Ross : -Wow. What does that mean? -No idea.
UNK: But the guy l said it to dies in the next scene...
UNK: ...so l guess it means, ''You'll get eaten by a bear.''
UNK: Okay.
Ross : -So let's move on to the Renaissance. -Okay.
Joey : Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...
Joey : ...to highlight the anguish of the central figure.
UNK: Touch it. lt's really bumpy.
Ross : No, no, no. No ad-libbing. And, dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Rachel : -Come on. -No. No!
UNK: My specimen's in the room.
UNK: l just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while l was in there.
Chandler : Really helped speed the process along.
Chandler : Janice, you're not gone?
Janice : Sid is still in his room.
UNK: l don't allow porn at home, so this is like a vacation for him.
Janice : So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
UNK: -Yeah. The hard part's over. -That's not the hard part, honey.
UNK: No, there's talking to you, but Monica's coming out.
UNK: And we're gonna go soon.
UNK: Chandler.
UNK: The hard part's what comes next. Aren't you worried about the results?
UNK: l mean, oh, when Sid and l did this last time, my God, l was a mess.
UNK: l haven't even thought about the results.
UNK: l just assumed everything would be okay.
UNK: Well, you know what? lt probably is.
UNK: But what if it's not okay?
UNK: l mean, what if there's a reason we can't have a baby?
Janice : Chandler. Look, you and Monica are meant to have children.
UNK: l'm sure it's gonna be just fine.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. l can't believe l didn't even think of that.
UNK: l guess l was so worried about having to come here and do that.
Janice : You can do it in a Taco Bell parking lot...
Janice : ...but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
UNK: lt was a Wendy's!
UNK: And that's the Swedish national anthem. Thank you for asking.
UNK: Wow, lkea.
Rachel : What a rich culture.
Charlie : You know what? l have a friend who's a masseuse.
UNK: -Oh? Ja, ja? -Ja. She's not very good, though.
Phoebe : -And why do you think that is? -l don't know.
UNK: Maybe it's because she's got such callousy fingers...
Rachel : ...from playing crummy guitar.
Phoebe : Or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots...
Phoebe : ...because you're such a high-maintenance tight-ass.
UNK: -Phoebe! -You know it's me?
