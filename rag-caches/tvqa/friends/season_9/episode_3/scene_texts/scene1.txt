UNK: -Really? -Yeah, you're my husband.
UNK: l won't live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Chandler : That's fast math. We could use you in Tulsa.
Monica : Thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you go to Tulsa, l go with you.
Chandler : You said that without gagging.
Monica : l know!
UNK: Well, excuse me?
Rachel : Oh, yeah? Well, up yours too!
Ross : -Who the hell was that? -Dr. Wiener.
Ross : Rach, you can't call people at 3 : 00 in the morning.
Rachel : You know what? You sound just like his wife.
Ross : Was there anything even wrong with Emma?
Rachel : Yes, of course there is! Okay? l'm not insane.
Ross : What was it?
UNK: Hiccups.
UNK: l told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
UNK: Well, not anymore l can't. He fired us!
UNK: Can you believe that?
UNK: l could believe it if he came here and hit you over the head with a copy of Highlights.
Rachel : What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician.
Rachel : Wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up...
UNK: ...you liked your doctor. What was his name?
Ross : Dr. Gettleman?
UNK: Yeah, no, l don't think that's a good idea.
UNK: ln fact, l think he's dead.
Rachel : Why does everything happen to me?
UNK: l promise, first thing tomorrow, we'll find another doctor.
UNK: But l gotta get up early, and l'm not feeling well.
Rachel : You're not feeling well? What do you have? Rubella?
Rachel : Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
Ross : You know, come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like.
UNK: Wiener!
UNK: Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!
UNK: Rachel!
Rachel : Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
UNK: And the kung pao chicken.
UNK: Utensils and plates for one.
UNK: And can you read the order back to me?
UNK: Great.
UNK: Yeah. Okay, thanks. Bye.

Ross : Oh, my God.
Phoebe : Great. Just the reaction l was hoping for.
Joey : Yeah, so you found someone for me? You didn't forget?
Phoebe : Of course not. And you'll love Mary Ellen.
UNK: She's really smart and cute and funny and....
UNK: l can't tell you how l know this, but she is not opposed to threesomes.
Rachel : All right.
UNK: -So tell me something about my guy. -No.
Phoebe : Come on, give me something. What's his name?
UNK: l'm not sure l understand the question.
UNK: What do they call him?
UNK: -Mike. -Mike. Okay, what's his last name?
UNK: Damn it! ls there no mystery left in romance anymore?!
UNK: We'll see you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
UNK: All right, great. See you. Bye-bye.
UNK: Why'd l have to say Mike? l don't know a Mike! Why couldn't l have said...?
UNK: There's no guys in there!

UNK: l think l can handle this.
UNK: Too intense. Too intense.
