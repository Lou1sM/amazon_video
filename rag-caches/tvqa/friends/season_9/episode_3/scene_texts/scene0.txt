Ross : So, what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
UNK: lt took you 45 minutes to cross a street.
UNK: Come on, guys. lt's just one baby.
UNK: Oh, sure, now you guys clam up.
Chandler : Our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa.
Chandler : So as of Monday, l'm being officially relocated.
Ross : -Oh, my God! -What? Monday?
Joey : -How long do you have to go for? -They said it could be up to a year.
Chandler : -A year? -Well, do you have to go?
UNK: Well, l kind of have to, don't l?
Monica : Because of this stupid thing.
UNK: There's nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
Joey : Wait a minute. Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.
UNK: Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets to the Jets game next week!
UNK: l'm sorry, but l don't think l'll be able to make it.
UNK: But we were gonna go see the Jets!
UNK: You can't go. l mean, you're the glue that holds this group together.
UNK: -Really? -Not you.
UNK: This whole thing is gonna be okay.
UNK: They said they'd rent us a house in the suburbs. You guys can come and visit.
UNK: Oh, God, that is so not gonna happen.
UNK: l can't believe you guys are moving.
UNK: -l call their apartment! -No!
Rachel : You know what? l'm not even sure l can have caffeine.
UNK: l went through this with Ben and Carol. One coffee won't affect your milk.
Rachel : Just to be sure, l'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Rachel : Every time?
UNK: You don't have to call him whenever you have a question, okay?
UNK: -Trust me. l know this. -All right. l trust you.
UNK: l can see you dialing. l don't understand why--
UNK: l'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
UNK: lt's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. lt's just so grownup.
UNK: l know, yeah. l feel like we're all growing up.
UNK: A person named ''Wiener.'' God, that kills me.
UNK: -Look at you all grownup. -Well, actually, you know what?
UNK: l am, you know?
UNK: Well, that whole thing with Rachel made me realize...
UNK: ...that maybe l'm ready for a more serious relationship, you know?
UNK: Like, l'd like to meet a nice, mature, commitment-minded lady.
UNK: And looks aren't as important as....
Joey : Nah, she's gotta be hot.
UNK: You know, l might know somebody.
Phoebe : How about you set me up with someone, and we double-date?
UNK: l can do that. Yeah. How's Friday?
UNK: -Done! -All right.
Phoebe : Good, really? Okay, let's see.
Rachel : All right.
Phoebe : You know who's great? Sandy Poopack.
UNK: ''Poopack''?
Phoebe : Yeah. All right. Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.
UNK: -l've got good news. -You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
UNK: Okay, l have news.
Chandler : You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
UNK: That's great! How?
UNK: My boss and l worked out a deal where l'm in Tulsa four days a week.
UNK: So the other three, l can be here with you.
Monica : So you're gonna be gone four days a week?
UNK: No.
UNK: l'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
UNK: No. l can't be away from you for that long.
