UNK: ...l'll tell them she's a chef at Javu.
UNK: And then, when they stare at me blankly...
UNK: ...l'll make some offensive Tulsa joke, and thus, begin my isolation.
Monica : -How was the pediatrician? -l really liked him.
Joey : Yeah, yeah. lt was really, really, really good.
UNK: -You promised not to say anything. -l know.
Rachel : Ross still sees his pediatrician!
UNK: l don't care.
Monica : Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
UNK: He is a brilliant diagnostician!
Chandler : Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
UNK: Seriously, you gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
UNK: And not an orthodontist...
UNK: ...not a gynecologist...
UNK: ...and not a veterinarian....
UNK: Why? l know it's a little weird, but he is a great doctor, okay?
Ross : He knows my medical history.
UNK: And every time l go in there, he makes a big deal.
Rachel : You know, ''Look, it's my favorite patient.''
Chandler : Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your tushy?
UNK: l seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college.
Chandler : That was not a security blanket. That was a wall hanging.
UNK: lt didn't spend much time on the wall!
Rachel : Excuse me.
UNK: Hi. l was hoping to run into you. Can we talk?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Yeah. There's someone l want you to meet.
UNK: This is my best friend from high school.
UNK: l'm sorry, l don't think l know you.
UNK: How hard was that?
UNK: Look, l'm sorry, really. l'm so embarrassed.
UNK: Please.
UNK: Really, l'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer.
UNK: Apparently, l'm not a funny guy.
UNK: Well, why did you go along with that?
UNK: Because l was told that l'd get a free dinner, which l didn't.
UNK: And that l'd meet a pretty girl, which l did.
Phoebe : That's true.
Phoebe : Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
UNK: My name is Mike. And l do play piano.
Phoebe : -Prove it. -There isn't a piano here.
Phoebe : That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : You are really good.
UNK: -l play a little guitar myself. -Really? That's great.
Mike : -What kind of music do you play? -Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?
UNK: But right now l'm working on a couple lron Maiden covers.
Mike : Do you think that, maybe, sometime, l could....
UNK: lt's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
UNK: Okay. You think, maybe, sometime l could take you out?
Phoebe : You just caught me off guard.
Phoebe : Yeah, that would be nice.
Joey : Look at this! My two best friends!
Rachel : Excuse me. l don't mean to be a jerk...
Ross : ...but the baby with the rash came in after me.
