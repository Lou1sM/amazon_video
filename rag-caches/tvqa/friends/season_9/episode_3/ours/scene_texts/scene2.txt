UNK: Well, l did it.
UNK: l told my crew at the restaurant l'm heading off to Tulsa.
UNK: -Oh, yeah? How'd they take it. -Pretty well. Yeah.
UNK: They were brave little soldiers.
UNK: Did their best to be stoic.
UNK: Some of them even high-fived each other to mask their pain.
UNK: lt's impossible to find a good doctor. How do you know the good ones...
UNK: ...from the ones who'll push their penis against your knee?
Rachel : Excuse me?
UNK: l know what she's talking about.
UNK: You probably also had the piano teacher with the wandering hands.
UNK: Well, we've gotta find a new pediatrician.
Rachel : Ross was getting sick last night, and Emma may have caught it.
UNK: -Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman? -Ross said he died.
Monica : He didn't die. l just saw his daughter last week.
UNK: She said he was fine. Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.
UNK: Great. Well then, l'm gonna take Emma to see him.
UNK: l wonder why Ross said that he died?
UNK: Maybe he confused him with his childhood therapist.
Chandler : He saw a therapist?
UNK: He used to have a recurring nightmare. lt freaked him out.
UNK: Wow, what was it?
UNK: That l was going to eat him.
UNK: Mike!
UNK: Yeah?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: l can't believe l'm doing this with you.
UNK: Although l did just end a nine-year relationship...
UNK: ...so l should be open to taking some risks.
UNK: That's good. Get all that boring stuff out now.
Joey : Everything is gonna be fine. Follow my lead, okay?
UNK: All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
UNK: -l am Mike. -Attaboy.
UNK: Here they come.
UNK: -l'm Phoebe. -Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?
UNK: -Nice to meet you. -Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.
Phoebe : So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other, anyway?
UNK: How do Joey and l know each other?
UNK: lf l had a nickel for every time somebody's asked me that.
Joey : -From school. -We met in college.
UNK: l mean high school.
Phoebe : You guys go way back, then. So, what are you up to these days?
UNK: -Well, l'm a lawyer. -Mike, attorney at law!
UNK: -Actually, l just gave up my practice. -What?
UNK: That's the kind of thing you usually run by me.
UNK: l want to play piano professionally. lf l don't do this now, l never will.
UNK: Great. l like that better than the lawyer thing.
UNK: Which is why l waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
UNK: Mary Ellen : You thought he was still a lawyer.
UNK: No, that's not what l meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Monica : What are you doing?
Chandler : Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Monica : That's so sweet. Did you find anything?
UNK: -Slim Pickins. -Nothing, huh?
UNK: No. Slim Pickins. lt's a barbecue joint.
UNK: They're looking for a cook. Actually, ''cook'' may be a bit of a stretch.
UNK: They're looking for somebody to shovel mesquite.
UNK: ''Slim Pickins''? That is so cheesy.
UNK: Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.
Monica : Honey, that's okay. l know this woman, Nancy...
UNK: ...who's a restaurant biz headhunter. She may know something.
UNK: Can l say how much l appreciate you coming with me?
UNK: When we get to Tulsa, l am taking you for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.
