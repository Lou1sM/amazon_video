UNK: Yeah. l don't know who l was kidding. l can barely use chopsticks.
Handyman : -You're all set. -Oh, thank you so much.
Rachel : Wait. You forgot your...
UNK: ...game.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: -Rach, is this my sweater? -Yeah.
UNK: What happened to the sleeve?
UNK: Moths?
Chandler : Hey, Rach. There she is, my perfectly proportioned wife.
Rachel : Don't look at me. l never get his jokes.
Rachel : -Thank you? -No, no. Don't thank me.
UNK: Thank you. Do you know there is not one thing l would change about you?
Chandler : Not one single thing. And definitely not...
Chandler : ...two single things.
UNK: Okay, you're being weird. Do you want sex, or did you do something bad?
UNK: No. No. No. l just love the way you look. l am warm...
UNK: ...for your form.
UNK: Okay, you know the old classics like, you know, ''You look nice''?
UNK: They're still okay.
UNK: But ''you look nice'' could mean that l'm saying, ''Your face looks nice.''
UNK: l want to compliment your body.
UNK: l mean, l wouldn't change it at all.
UNK: And more specifically, l wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
UNK: -Okay. -l mean...
Chandler : ...you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger, would you?
Chandler : Don't answer that.
Rachel : Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.
Monica : Why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
UNK: l don't know. l mean, what brought that on?
UNK: Oh, my God. You know what, we're trying to get pregnant...
UNK: ...so he's probably starting to freak out that my body's gonna change.
UNK: -You think that's what it is? -You heard him.
UNK: ''No bigger. You're perfect. Just don't get any bigger.''
Monica : My God, he sounded just like my high-school wrestling coach.
UNK: -l'm gonna have to talk to Chandler. -Yeah. lf you don't, l will.
Rachel : Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger...
Rachel : ...your ass is gonna get bigger...
UNK: ...you're gonna lose bladder control.
Rachel : God, it's just such a magical time.
UNK: Hi. Listen, l wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Ross : Now you're seeking me out to make jokes?
UNK: l mean, l can see if we're all hanging out, but to come to my home....
UNK: No, l really want to know how you feel about it.
UNK: -Why? -Mike doesn't ever want to get married.
UNK: -Never? -Never.
UNK: Wow. Are you still gonna move in with him?
UNK: l want to, but l wanted you to tell me that marriage really isn't that big a deal.
UNK: You know, that l won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks.
Ross : Yeah, marriage stinks.
UNK: l mean, if you want to see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving...
Ross : ...get them married.
Phoebe : -That's not how you really feel, is it? -No, l'm sorry.
UNK: l know it's not what you want to hear, but l can't help it. l love marriage.
Phoebe : Seriously, you? ''Divorce-o''?
UNK: lf you have to call me a name, l'd prefer ''Ross, the Divorcer.'' lt's just cooler.
