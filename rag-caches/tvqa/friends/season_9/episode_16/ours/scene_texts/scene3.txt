UNK: ...will never get back to Chandler.
UNK: l'd be lying if l said l hadn't thought about it myself.
UNK: But Chandler is my best friend. lt would be wrong.
UNK: Good, but wrong.
UNK: Okay, first of all, it would be great.
UNK: But that's not what l'm here to talk to you about. l need to borrow money.
UNK: Oh, l don't know, Monica. You know...
Joey : ...lending friends money is always a mistake.
Monica : -But Chandler lent you money. -And he would tell you it was a mistake.
UNK: Come on, l just.... l need it for some rent and some other bills.
UNK: Well, how much?
Monica : -Two thousand dollars? -Two thousand dollars?
UNK: What do you think l am, a soap opera star?
UNK: -Yeah. -That's right, l am.
UNK: Promise me you'll never tell Chandler.
UNK: lt'll really hurt his pride.
UNK: Chandler? Pride?
UNK: l know, he thinks he has it. lt's really cute.
Rachel : -Hi, you guys. -Hey.
Joey : -What's in the bag? -You know how Emma started crawling?
UNK: l realized that this place is very unsafe for a baby...
UNK: ...so l went to the store and l got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
UNK: Oh, God, baby-proofing.
UNK: Why is it such a big deal now? You know, when l was a kid, it was like :
Joey : ''Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs.''
UNK: Or, ''Whoops, Joey electrocuted himself again.''
UNK: Anyway, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
UNK: No, l was just gonna do it myself.
Joey : -You're gonna do it? -Yeah. Why?
Rachel : -You don't think a woman can do this? -Women can. You can't.
UNK: Monica, will you please tell Joey that he is a pig.
Monica : -You're a pig. And you can't do this. -What?
UNK: What? Come on, l found the hardware store all by myself.
UNK: The store's right down the street.
Rachel : There is a hardware store right down the street?
Phoebe : Hey, you guys? Okay, we've got great news.
UNK: -Phoebe and l are moving in together. -Congratulations.
UNK: l know, it's so exciting. You know, l've never lived with a guy before.
UNK: Well, it's just like living with a girl, only they don't steal your makeup.
UNK: Unless they're playing ''This ls What My Sister Would Look Like.''
Chandler : Yeah, she's not so cute.
UNK: -l'm gonna go to the bathroom. -Well, you put down the toilet seat.
Mike : Yes, dear.
UNK: -ls that a bit you guys do? -Uh-huh. We're playing you two.
Chandler : We don't do that. Tell her we don't do that.
Mike : Yes, dear.
UNK: l can't believe you're moving in together. l'm happy for you guys.
UNK: l mean, he's a great catch. And those eyes....
UNK: l'm a scientist. l observe.
UNK: Gosh, this is so exciting! You guys are really moving along.
UNK: -l hear wedding bells. -Monica, slow down, okay?
UNK: l'm just excited to be living with him.
UNK: You know, l mean, l don't know...
UNK: ...can l see someday being married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.
UNK: l could picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress...
Phoebe : ...that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way.
UNK: But do l want that house in Connecticut near the good schools...
UNK: ...where Mike and l could send little Sophie and Mike Jr.?
UNK: Oh, my God, l do.
UNK: -l had no idea you were so conventional. -l know. l guess l am.
Phoebe : Oh, my God, load up the Volvo, l want to be a soccer mom.
Mike : -You ready to go? -Yeah, you bet, roomie.
UNK: Don't you mean ''groomie''?
UNK: Honey, leave the terrible jokes to me.
Mike : -What are you talking about? -Please.
Phoebe : We haven't even moved in yet, and they have us picking out china patterns.
Phoebe : China patterns!
UNK: This is easy. ''Can't do this....''
