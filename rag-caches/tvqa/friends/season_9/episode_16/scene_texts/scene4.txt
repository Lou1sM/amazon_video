UNK: Wow, seriously. Can't do this.
Monica : -Hey, Joe. -Hey.
UNK: You here with somebody?
UNK: No.
UNK: Look, l need to ask you a favor, and we can't tell Monica anything about it.
UNK: -l thought you guys didn't have secrets. -That will remain the official party line.
UNK: Look, Monica and l are having a little financial trouble.
UNK: -Yeah, l know. -What? What do you mean, you ''know''?
UNK: l just figured it out, you know?
UNK: l mean, you're not working, and the economy is bad.
Chandler : Oh, right.
UNK: That is the fastest l have ever thought.
UNK: Anyway...
UNK: ...l need to borrow some money.
UNK: Oh, sure. Yeah, how much? Two thousand dollars?
UNK: Yes, $2000 exactly. How did you know that?
UNK: l know how much you used to make, and l know how much your rent is.
UNK: Oh, okay.
UNK: l am on fire.
UNK: Listen, this is really nice.
UNK: Did you write a check to Monica for $2000?
UNK: Chandler stands Up And Walks To Joey : Did Monica borrow money from you?
Joey : -Kind of. -l can't believe her.
Chandler : Did she tell you we were having money problems?
UNK: No, no, no. lt wasn't because of your money problems.
UNK: lt was for something for her.
UNK: What?
Joey : Something personal.
UNK: What would she get for $2000 that she wouldn't tell me about?
Woman : Excuse me.
Joey : Boob job.
UNK: What? That's ridiculous. She doesn't need a boob job.
UNK: Why wouldn't she tell me about it?
UNK: She was afraid you wouldn't be supportive.
UNK: -l'm not. -She knows you well.
UNK: You can't tell her that you know. l swore l wouldn't tell.
UNK: A boob job? She doesn't need that. That's crazy.
UNK: Well, it's not that crazy, okay?
Joey : Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
UNK: Hey, so where do you keep your secret box of porn?
UNK: l don't have any porn.
UNK: Back of the closet in my bedroom.
UNK: Oh, hey, l wanted to ask you about Monica's little ''groomie'' joke.
UNK: Well, l think the reason people laughed is that it's a play on the word ''roomie.''
UNK: l get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.
UNK: No, the thing l want to say is....
UNK: Maybe we should've talked about this before.
Mike : Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
UNK: -Oh, no, no. Not at all. -Okay.
Phoebe : We're just moving in right now. We'll see where it goes.
Mike : Yeah, well, that's the thing. For me, it's as far as it can ever go.
Chandler : -What do you mean? -Look, Phoebe, l....
UNK: l love you very much. But l never want to get married again.
UNK: -Wow. -lt's just, my first marriage was...
UNK: ...you know, such a disaster that l kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
UNK: -Was it that bad? -At one point, near the end...
UNK: -...she deliberately defecated on my-- -Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.
Phoebe : But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps...
UNK: ...a blond who always uses the toilet?
UNK: Except for once in the ocean.
UNK: Look, it's not about who l would marry.
UNK: l was certain the first time l got married it'd last forever. l was wrong.
Phoebe : -But, it just-- -Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.
UNK: l just never want to get married again.
