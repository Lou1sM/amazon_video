UNK: Look, l know my marriages didn't exactly work out...
UNK: ...but, you know, l loved being that committed to another person.
UNK: And Carol and l had some good times before she became a lesbian.
Ross : And once afterward.
UNK: Anyway, l'm sorry.
UNK: lt's okay. That's how you feel.
UNK: But, come on, l mean, living together will be great.
UNK: l mean, you guys have so much fun. And you love Mike.
UNK: -l do love Mike. -Yeah, see?
Ross : And you were so excited about moving in together before...
Ross : ...and you know what, you should be. lt's a big deal.
UNK: Yeah, l guess you're right.
Phoebe : Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Ross : The Divorcer to the rescue.
UNK: -lt's not cooler. -Yeah, l just heard it.
UNK: Rach?
UNK: Rachel?!
UNK: So l can't do anything l like?!
UNK: Unbelievable.
UNK: Chandler wants you to have a baby, but he doesn't want your body to change.
UNK: lt's not like he's so perfect.
UNK: -Hey, that's my husband. -All right.
UNK: Let's solve one problem at a time.
Chandler : Hey, Rach.
UNK: Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
UNK: -Honey? -Yeah?
Monica : About that.
UNK: -l'm going to change. -Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.
UNK: l'm gonna get bigger.
UNK: Honey, l....
UNK: l love your breasts the way they are.
UNK: Fascist.
UNK: My breasts are gonna get bigger whether you like it or not.
UNK: And it's not just my breasts. My ass is gonna get bigger too.
Rachel : Your ass?!
UNK: And don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too.
UNK: -They do that? -lt's kind of a package deal.
Chandler : God, why? Why would you want to do that to yourself?
UNK: l thought it was something that we both wanted.
UNK: lf it means that much to you, l may be able to get onboard with the boobs...
Chandler : ...but the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Rachel : Oh, my God, Chandler.
UNK: lf you can't handle this, what will you be like in the hospital...
UNK: ...with the blood and screaming and the little person that's shooting out of her?
UNK: What?
Rachel : Joey, why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Joey : Because she is.
UNK: -Chandler knows l borrowed the money. -For your boob job.
UNK: -Joe.... -lt's over.
UNK: Okay, so l'm out $4000 and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
UNK: Hey. Hey, what do you guys think about this : Ross, the Divorce Force.
UNK: -Better. -Yeah?
Mike : Very cool.
UNK: Hey, Pheebs? You know, l'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day...
UNK: -...and l hope l was a little helpful. -Yeah, you were helpful.
UNK: -Yeah. No, thank you. -Good. Good.
UNK: Because the more l thought about it, the more l realized...
UNK: ...l don't think marriage is necessarily the right path for you.
Chandler : What do you mean?
