Phoebe : Yeah. Chandler, why don't you take a walk.
UNK: This doesn't concern you.
Rachel : We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler : -What? That's terrible. -No, no. We do it every year.
UNK: Well, that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe : No. Yeah, we never find them. She's always bested us, that wily...
UNK: ...minx.
UNK: We're gonna search here for an hour...
UNK: ...and then we'll go to Joey's and search. Okay?
Chandler : No, not okay. You can't look for Monica's presents.
Phoebe : -No, we have to. -No, you don't have to.
Chandler : And you can't, because l live here too.
Phoebe : -Well, then you should look with us. -Why?
Rachel : Aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
UNK: No, l have a great idea for a present for her.
UNK: That's it? ''A great idea''?
Rachel : That's not enough. What if she gets you a great present...
Rachel : ...two medium presents and lots of little presents...
UNK: ...and you got her one great present? That's gonna make her feel bad.
UNK: Why would you do that to her? Why? Why?
UNK: -lf l helped, we could find them faster! -Right.
Phoebe : -We have a live one! -lt's a Macy's bag!
Phoebe : Who's it for?
UNK: ''Dear Losers : Do you really think l'd hide presents under the couch?
UNK: P.S. Chandler, l knew they'd break you.''
Joey : Rach, these are for you.
UNK: Wiper blades. l don't even have a car.
UNK: No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do.
UNK: Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
Phoebe : Toilet seat covers!
UNK: ls that what you were doing while l was getting gas?
Chandler : You guys.
UNK: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.
Ross : -You got me a cola drink? -And...a lemon-lime!
Ross : Well, this-- This is too much.
UNK: l feel like l should get you another sweater.
Chandler : And last but not least....
UNK: They're ribbed, for your pleasure.
UNK: Well, hey, Ben?
Ross : What if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
UNK: Cool!
Monica : Come on, Ben.
Ross : Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees!
Phoebe : Merry Christmas!
UNK: Santa!
Ross : What are you doing here, Santa?
UNK: Well, l'm here to see my old buddy Ben.
Ross : What are you doing here...
UNK: ...weird turtle-man?
UNK: l'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend.
UNK: You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
UNK: Remember?
UNK: What?
UNK: Ben, why don't you open some more presents.
UNK: Santa, the armadillo and l will have a talk in the kitchen.
UNK: There's a sentence l never thought l'd say.
Ross : What are you doing?
UNK: You called and said you had trouble finding a Santa costume...
UNK: ...so l borrowed one from a guy at work.
UNK: Thank you, but you gotta leave.
UNK: -Why? -Because...
