UNK: -You've thought about that? -Yeah.
Monica : -How many kids were we gonna have? -Four. A boy, twin girls...
Chandler : ...and another boy.
Monica : -What else did you think about? -Well...
UNK: ...stuff like where we'd live, you know.
UNK: Like a small place outside the city where our kids could ride bikes and stuff.
UNK: And we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar...
Chandler : ...and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.
UNK: We'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Chandler : You know what?
UNK: l don't-- l don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Chandler : -Sure you do. -No.
UNK: l want everything that you've just said.
UNK: l want a marriage.
Chandler : You sure?
UNK: -l love you so much. -l love you.
UNK: -l love it! -Really? You're not gonna return it?
UNK: Well, not this second.
UNK: Hey, look, you guys. lt's snowing!
Rachel : -Wow, it's so beautiful. -Wow, it really is.
UNK: Wendy's a fat-girl name.
Phoebe : Aren't we done with that?
UNK: Okay, fine. Fine. Let's talk about snow.
UNK: Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa where my husband's having sex on a copier?
UNK: -Hey. -Oh, my God.
Joey : Look at that. That's a Christmas miracle!
Ross : -What are you doing here? -l wanted to be with you.
UNK: l missed you so much.
UNK: -Hey, hey. Who'd you miss the most? -Monica.
UNK: Gotcha.
UNK: -l never want to leave you again. -l thought if you left, you'd get fired.
Chandler : Turns out they can't fire me. Because l quit.
UNK: -What? -What? You--? You really quit your job?
UNK: Yeah. lt was a stupid job, and l could not stand leaving you.
UNK: Why should l be the only one who doesn't do what he really wants to do?
UNK: -Well, what do you really wanna do? -l have not thought this through.
Ross : -Oh, my God. -l know. l should've talked to you first.
UNK: No, l think that this is what you wanna do. l think it's great!
UNK: Thanks.
Phoebe : Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present l could ever imagine.
Phoebe : -Now give me my real gift. -Yeah.
Ross : -Thank you. -Here, pass those around.
Nick : ''A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet.''
Ross : How did you know?
UNK: What? Are you kidding? l can't return this.
UNK: lt's time we started thinking about other people.
UNK: And besides, this gift still says, ''l love you guys.''
UNK: -Mine says, ''To Lillian Myers.'' -l don't have a job.
UNK: Actuary? No.
UNK: Bookkeeper? No.
UNK: Topless dancer?
UNK: Hey, you know what l just realized? You are the sole wage earner.
UNK: You are the head of the household. l don't do anything. l'm a kept man!
Monica : You are.
UNK: Honey, here's 20 bucks.
UNK: Go buy yourself something pretty while l'm at work tomorrow.
