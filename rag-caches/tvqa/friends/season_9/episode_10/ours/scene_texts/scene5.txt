Chandler : What's going on? You and l just made out.
UNK: -You and l are making out? -Well, not anymore.
Chandler : -But we don't do that. -l know. l just thought it would be fun.
Chandler : -How drunk are you? -Drunk enough that l wanna do this.
UNK: Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
UNK: That's a perfect amount.
UNK: -You know what's weird? -What?
Monica : -This doesn't feel weird. -l know.
Monica : -You're a really good kisser. -Well, l have kissed over four women.
UNK: You wanna get under the covers? Okay.
Monica : Wow, you are really fast.
UNK: lt bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica : -We're gonna see each other naked. -Yep.
UNK: -You want to do it at the same time? -Count of three?
UNK: -One. -Two.
UNK: Three.
UNK: Well, l think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Monica : We weren't that close anyway.
Chandler : Are you really gonna go out with that nurse-man?
UNK: Well, you and l are just goofing around.
UNK: l thought, why not just goof around with him?
UNK: l don't know if you've ever looked up ''goofing around'' in the dictionary.
UNK: Well, l have.
UNK: And the technical definition is two friends...
Chandler : ...who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex...
UNK: ...and just want to spend more time together.
UNK: lf you have this newfangled dictionary that gets you mad at me...
UNK: ...then we have to, you know, get you my original dictionary.
UNK: l am so bad at this.
UNK: l think you're better than you think you are.
UNK: -Really? Okay. So if--? -Know when to stop.
UNK: l sensed that l should stop.
Chandler : -So we're okay? -Yeah.
UNK: -Don't do the dance. -Right.
UNK: l can't get married without something old, something new...
UNK: -...something borrowed, something blue. -Okay, okay.
Chandler : Here's something blue and new.
UNK: You are so efficient. l love you.
Chandler : -Let's go. -No, no, wait!
Monica : We need something old.
UNK: Okay. l have a condom in my wallet that l've had since l was 1 2.
Monica : That'll work!
UNK: l don't think so.
Monica : Okay. Now we just need something borrowed.
UNK: -Here, just take this. -That's stealing.
Chandler : We'll bring it back. Just put it under your dress.
