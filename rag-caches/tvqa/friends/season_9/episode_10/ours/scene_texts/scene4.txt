UNK: Really?
UNK: Would that be so terrible?
Chandler : This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about...
UNK: ...but you're getting ham on my only tie.

UNK: Or, in this case, right on the money.
UNK: You know, she's amazing and beautiful and smart.
UNK: And if she were here right now, she'd kick your ass.
UNK: Look, you're a really nice person, ham-stealing and adultery aside.
UNK: But what l have with my wife is pretty great.

UNK: Okay, let me ask you something.
