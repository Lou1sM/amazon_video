UNK: Wow, you seemed pretty insulted by that.
UNK: What, l'm not good enough for you?
Chandler : We are not gonna have this conversation again.
Chandler : Look at this place. Why am l so intimidated by this guy?
Chandler : Pretentious art. This huge, macho couch.
Chandler : When we know all he does is sit around...
UNK: ...crying about losing Monica to a real man.
UNK: -You don't think he's here, do you? -l don't know.
UNK: lt's a nice place, but l gotta say, l don't know if l see myself living here.
UNK: Well, let me see.
UNK: Yeah, l can see it.
UNK: Look at these videos. l mean, who does he think he is?
UNK: Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke.
Ross : -Oh, my God. -What?
Chandler : There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Joey : A tape with a girl's name on it. lt's probably a sex tape.
Joey : Wait a minute.
Joey : This says ''Monica.''
UNK: And this is Richard's apartment.
Chandler : Get there faster!
Mike : Wow. You look...
Mike : ...like my mom.
UNK: l'm wearing pantyhose.
Mike : -Great! Come on in. -Okay.
Phoebe : Thank you.
Phoebe : -Oh, my God. You're rich. -No, my parents are rich.
UNK: Well, so? They gotta die someday. Hello!
UNK: Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.
UNK: Phoebe, these are my parents, Theodore and Bitsy.
Phoebe : Theodore, Bitsy...
Phoebe : ...what a delight.
UNK: -lt's so nice to finally meet you. -And you.
Phoebe : Your home is lovely.
UNK: Thank you. l'll give you a tour later. lt's actually three floors.
Phoebe : Holy crap!
UNK: Why don't you come meet our friends.
Phoebe : Try and stop me.
Mike : -What are you doing? -Trying to get your parents to like me.
UNK: l'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this.
UNK: l want them to get to know Phoebe, not ''Phoebe.''
UNK: lt is fun, though, isn't it?
UNK: -You've got it. -All right.
UNK: lt's hard to stop.
Mike : Well, come on.
Theodore : Phoebe, these are our friends Tom and Sue Engel.
Bitsy : Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself.
Bitsy : -So where are you from? -Okay.
UNK: Well, all right. Originally, l'm from upstate...
UNK: ...but then my mom killed herself, and my stepdad went to prison.
UNK: So l moved to the city, where l lived in a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.
