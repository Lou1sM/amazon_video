UNK: Yeah, well, poor Richard, he....
UNK: l can grow a mustache.
UNK: This is not our problem. We have each other. That's all that matters.
UNK: But l just keep picturing you rolling around with him, with your...
Chandler : ...cowboy boots in the air.
UNK: Cowboy boots? l've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life.
Chandler : Good, good. Play more because l wanna see how it ends.
Monica : -That's not me! -What?
Chandler : That's not you! Life is good again!
Chandler : Ride 'em, cowgirl!
Monica : That bastard taped over me!
UNK: ls that a problem?
UNK: lt's just so insulting. Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!
UNK: Yes, but the important thing is that we have each other, right?
UNK: Well, yeah. lt's just so rude!
UNK: -And the way we did it was a lot better-- -Are you going to finish that sentence?
UNK: l can't imagine what he sees in her.
Bitsy : She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his.
Bitsy : Hello, dear.
Mike : -What's going on? -We were just chitchatting.
Bitsy : -How's your friend? -A little better.
Bitsy : Do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.
Theodore : You remember her, Michael. She's lovely, well-behaved and single.
UNK: -l'm not interested. -Please, darling, let's be honest.
Bitsy : You can have all the sailor fun you want with that one.
Bitsy : -But let's be real. -All right, stop.
UNK: All Phoebe has done is try and get you to like her. Maybe it's not clear...
Mike : ...but she did her best.
Mike : -She's a little different than you are. -Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.
UNK: So what? lf l can get past that, it shouldn't bother you.
Mike : You don't have to like her. Just accept the fact that l do.
UNK: lf you can't even be civil to the woman l love--
Bitsy : -The woman you what? -Yeah, the woman you what?
UNK: The woman l love.
UNK: l love you.
UNK: Something l shouldn't say for the first time, in front of my parents...
Mike : ...and Tom and Sue.
Mike : Who are, by the way, the most sinfully boring people l've ever met in my life.
UNK: -l love you too. -You do?
Phoebe : How great is this?
Mike : Wanna get out of here?
Mike : -Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner. -l had a great time.
UNK: lt was really top-drawer. And here's something rich.
UNK: Thirteen bathrooms in this place, l threw up in the coat closet.
UNK: Ta-ta!
Rachel : One more time from the top!
Ross : Rachel, please! That is so inappropriate!
