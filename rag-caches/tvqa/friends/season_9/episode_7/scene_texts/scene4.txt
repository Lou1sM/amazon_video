Phoebe : Which was okay. That was okay.
UNK: Until l got hepatitis, you know...
UNK: ...because this pimp spit in my mouth and....
UNK: But l got over it.
UNK: And, anyway, now l'm a freelance massage therapist...
UNK: ...which isn't always steady money, but at least l don't pay taxes.
Phoebe : So where does everyone summer?
UNK: l'm not gonna watch it. l don't need to watch it.
UNK: l mean, what good could possibly come from watching it?
UNK: Well, we know l'm gonna watch it.
Joey : -Hey, dude, what's up? -Don't judge me! l'm only human!
Joey : Did you take that tape?
UNK: l had to! lmagine you were married and you found a tape of your wife...
Chandler : ...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
UNK: l don't know. Who am l married to?
Chandler : Some girl.
Joey : She hot?
Joey : How did she get me to settle down?
UNK: All right, l'm gonna watch it.
UNK: l mean, it's probably not even what l think it is.
Chandler : Even if it is, it can't possibly be as bad as what l'm picturing in my head.
Chandler : Can it?
UNK: ln my experience, if a girl says yes to being taped...
UNK: ...she doesn't say no to much else, l'll tell you.
UNK: -Then you have to watch it for me. -What?
Chandler : Just for a few seconds so l can know what it is. Please?
UNK: All right, fine. But if l enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame!
UNK: -Why am l hearing cheering? -lt's okay. lt's just a football game.
UNK: -lt's just football? -You were all worried for nothing.
UNK: lt's football! lt's just football!
Chandler : This is great! This is the first time l've ever enjoyed football!
UNK: l think it may be customary to get a beer.
Chandler : What the...?
Mike : -What are you doing? -You don't wanna see what l just saw!
Monica : What are you guys doing?
UNK: Oh, my God! ls that Richard?
UNK: -Oh, God, this is not going well. -No, you're doing fine. Really.
Mike : -Why don't you go talk to my dad. -Okay, okay, okay.
Phoebe : -Still sure about me being myself? -Absolutely.
UNK: Though maybe just a little less ''pimp spit.''
UNK: So, Theodore, l can see where Mike gets his good looks from.
UNK: Well....
Phoebe : -You must work out all the time. -Not all the time. l do the best l can.
UNK: Yeah, l bet. Look out!
Phoebe : -Oh, my God. Are you okay? -l recently had surgery.
UNK: -l'm so sorry. -No, l'll be fine.
UNK: -l just should check the stitches. -l really am sorry.
Theodore : How could you know? Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
Mike : Did you just hit my dad?
UNK: Yes. l'm sorry. l've never met a boyfriend's parents before.
UNK: But, l mean, you have met humans before, right?
Mike : Why don't you go talk to my mom.
Phoebe : Okay, yeah, your mom. She looks nice. l can talk to her.
UNK: You do that, and l'm gonna go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding.
UNK: Bitsy? Listen, l wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
