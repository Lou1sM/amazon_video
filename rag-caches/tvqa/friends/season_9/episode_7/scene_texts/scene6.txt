UNK: Awesome.
UNK: Okay, please laugh for Mommy. Please?
Rachel : Please laugh for Mommy.
Rachel : Not funny, huh?
UNK: Well, so is it...
Rachel : ...only offensive novelty rap?
Rachel : Or maybe just, you know, rap in general. Because Mommy can rap.
UNK: l can't rap.
UNK: All right, sweetheart. This is only because l love you so much.
UNK: And l know that you're not gonna tell anybody.
UNK: Emma, you're laughing! You are!
Rachel : You really do like big butts, don't you?
Rachel : You beautiful little weirdo.
Rachel : You missed it! She was laughing!
UNK: lt was amazing.
UNK: lt was amazing. lt was the most beautiful, beautiful sound.
UNK: l know, isn't it? What'd you do to get her to laugh?
UNK: You know, l just.... A couple of things l tried. Different....
Rachel : Just sang a little ''The ltsy-Bitsy Spider.''
Ross : You sang ''Baby Got Back,'' didn't you?
Rachel : Nothing else worked! That girl is all about the ass!
Phoebe : And then it goes back to the chorus.
UNK: Resolve. And that's the end of the song.
UNK: l realize you hadn't asked to hear it...
UNK: ...but no one had spoken in 1 7 minutes.
UNK: Phoebe writes lots of songs. What was that one you sang the other night?
Phoebe : ''Pervert Parade''?
Phoebe : -''Ode to a Pubic Hair''? -Stop.
UNK: Oh, God. ls that veal?
UNK: Mom, l thought l told you, Phoebe's a vegetarian.
Phoebe : No, that's okay. That's okay. l mean, l am a vegetarian...
Phoebe : ...except for veal. Yeah. No. Veal l love.
UNK: -Phoebe, you don't have to eat that. -Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.
UNK: But, you know, especially veal.
UNK: You know, and this nice vein of fat running through it.
UNK: Yummy.
UNK: So...
Mike : ...what do you think?
Monica : So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
UNK: Listen to the judgment from the porn star!
Monica : That tape was never meant to be seen by....
UNK: Joey, l would feel more comfortable if this conversation were in private.
UNK: Monica, look, l don't think you and l have any secrets anymore.
Joey : Not ready to joke about it yet? See you later.
Monica : Why in the world would you take this tape? And why would you watch it?
UNK: Because that's who l am. Okay?
UNK: l'm sure a man like Richard could see a tape like that and not be bothered.
UNK: lt'd just be another saucy anecdote...
Chandler : ...for him to share at his men's club over brandy and mustaches.
UNK: ls all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache?
Chandler : This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you.
Chandler : He keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants.
UNK: lsn't that sad? Can't you see how pathetic that is?
UNK: Don't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
