UNK: Like when l bought these shoes. They were cute and they liked me too.
Phoebe : But what about Ross? What about your moment?

UNK: Maybe if we live together for another 1 0 years, we may hold hands!
UNK: But you were really excited about it.
UNK: -Don't you wanna talk to him? -No.

UNK: ...and not tell each other how we're feeling?''
Rachel : ''Yeah, that works for me.''
UNK: Yeah, l see what you mean.
Phoebe : By the way, nice Ross imitation.
UNK: Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
UNK: -Well-- Hey! -Better.

UNK: You know? l should just move on with my life.
UNK: So really, you're moving on from Ross?
UNK: l don't know. Do l have to decide right now?
UNK: You kind of just did. That guy is gonna call you tonight.
