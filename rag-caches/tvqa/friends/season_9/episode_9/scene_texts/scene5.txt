UNK: l can't do that!
UNK: -He says he can't do that. -Give me the phone.
UNK: Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, l know that this is a lot to ask, but you know what?
UNK: lf you do this, Phoebe will do anything you want.
UNK: -Seriously, l'm talking dirty stuff. -All right. Thank you. Hello?
UNK: Hi, l'm sorry about her. But actually, she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
UNK: All right, l'll do it.
UNK: But really, how much dirtier can it get?
Phoebe : Oh, Mike.
UNK: Bye.
Mike : Hey, buddy.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: -Can l come back in? -Why?
UNK: Well, l was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.
Ross : But you left.
UNK: That didn't take long.
UNK: l thought you said Tulsa was, like, a three-hour flight?
UNK: Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
UNK: -You ready? l'm gonna go in there with you. -Thanks.
UNK: Just in case there's more than one dude in there.
Chandler : -Again, thanks. -Yeah.
UNK: Chandler, you're home!
UNK: That's right! Your husband's home! So now the sex can stop!
UNK: You know what l mean.
Monica : What are you saying?
UNK: Joey said you're here with another man!
Monica : There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that!
UNK: All right. Then maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around.
UNK: He can't even see us!
UNK: -l kind of liked it. -Me too.
UNK: What's he doing?
UNK: l arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
UNK: Bedroom's clear. Although you might need some new pillows.
UNK: All right, well, l'll check the guest room.
UNK: Why do l smell men's cologne?
UNK: l think that's you.
UNK: Oh, yeah. l rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
UNK: There's nobody here, Joe.
UNK: l guess not.
UNK: l can't believe you thought l was cheating. You owe me an apology.
UNK: -You're right. l'm so sorry. -lt's an honest mistake.
UNK: lt could happen to anybody. See you.
UNK: Wait a minute, wait a minute.
UNK: lf you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
UNK: l climbed down the fire escape, and you can't put that in the closet?
Mike : So, with the exception of the fermentation process...
Mike : ...beer and ale are basically the same thing.
UNK: Fascinating, isn't it?
Ross : Maybe you should look up ''fascinating.''
UNK: l'll get it!
UNK: Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.
