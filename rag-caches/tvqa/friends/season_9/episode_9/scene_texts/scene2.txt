UNK: My cousin's a paleontologist.
UNK: Well, he and l would probably have a lot to talk about.
Monica : -Welcome home. -Well, look at you.
UNK: Yeah. What do you think?
UNK: Well, it looks great. lt's just--
UNK: l'm wearing the same thing underneath, so....
UNK: You see what l mean?
UNK: Hey! How come your door's locked?
Monica : -Just a second! -No, no, no!
UNK: -Joey can't know l'm here. -Why not?
UNK: l didn't want to say l couldn't go to the game...
UNK: -...so l told him l had to stay in Tulsa. -So you lied to him?
UNK: lt's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
Chandler : Except with you.
UNK: Hey, open the door! What's going on?
Rachel : -What are you--? -Hi.
Joey : Why are you dressed like that?
UNK: Because Chandler's gonna be home in a couple of days...
UNK: ...so l thought l would just, you know, practice the art of seduction.
UNK: l thought l heard a man's voice before.
UNK: No, l was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.
UNK: You know, like, ''Hi, how do l look?''
UNK: ''Really sexy. Could l be any more turned on?'' You know?
UNK: Okay. Wait a minute.
Joey : Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Monica : Because one of them is for you!
UNK: Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.
UNK: You know, it's funny. l've been practicing the art of seduction myself.
UNK: -You might wanna keep practicing. -Yeah.
UNK: -lt's Joey. -What?
Chandler : -Hey, Joe. -Dude, come home!
Chandler : -What? Why? -Come home!
UNK: Look, l can't. What's going on?
UNK: l don't know how to tell you this, but l think Monica's cheating on you!
UNK: l told you, you shouldn't have married someone hotter than you!
UNK: lf you can't deal with this, then l'm gonna.
UNK: -No! -l just heard him!
Chandler : Can you hear him now?
UNK: No. All right, l'm going in.
Chandler : -No, wait! -l heard him again!
UNK: All right, just stay there. l'm coming home.
UNK: l'll see you when you get here.
UNK: l'll wait out in the hall in case he comes out.
UNK: -ls that really necessary? -Absolutely. You'd do it for me.
UNK: Not that you ever have to, because l know how to keep my women satisfied.
UNK: -Yeah, listen, thanks a lot. -Okay, bye.
UNK: He thinks l'm a slut.
UNK: Oh, right, and you're supposed to be a fireman?
UNK: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
UNK: l mean, they said 30 minutes or less. Well, how long has it been?
Mike : Eleven minutes.
UNK: And now 1 2.
UNK: -So you wanna watch TV? -You think l haven't thought of that?
UNK: l mean, l would like to but the cable's out.
UNK: Didn't seem like such a big deal until tonight.
UNK: -So you like the beer? -l do. l do.
