Phoebe : So, what were you doing out there? Do you not like Charlie?
UNK: She's okay. l don't know, l just don't get a really good vibe from her.
UNK: -Why? -l don't know.
Rachel : You know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart...
Rachel : ...and tall, you know...
Rachel : ...and just swept Joey off his feet. Nobody else has a chance.
Phoebe : -Who else? -Anybody.
Rachel : You. Me.
Rachel : You know, Monica's mom.
Phoebe : You like Joey?!
UNK: Phoebe!
UNK: All right, look, l do. l have a little thing for him. Just--
Phoebe : -Oh, my God. -lt's just physical.
UNK: l have it totally under control, okay? lt's just when l see them together...
UNK: ...sometimes, l just get a little jealous.
UNK: Wow. lsn't that ironic that he liked you, and now you like--?
UNK: l get it!
UNK: All right, as long as it's under control.
Phoebe : You can't do anything about it. He's already dating her.
Phoebe : She is a nice person. That wouldn't be right.
UNK: l know, l know. So it's just not a big deal.
Rachel : -So can we keep this between us? -Sure.
UNK: Great, because l gotta get out of here. The smell of beets is killing me.
