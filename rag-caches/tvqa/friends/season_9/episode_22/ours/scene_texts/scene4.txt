Phoebe : Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Monica : -Hi, honey. -Hey.
UNK: l brought a friend home for dinner. This is Zack from work.
UNK: Oh, of course. lt's so nice to see you again, Zack.
Zack : -You too. -You guys haven't actually met before.
Chandler : But, boy, you're both polite.
UNK: Have a seat. l'll get you a beer.
UNK: -l got it. -Thanks.
UNK: -So Zack's pretty nice, huh? -Yeah, l guess.
Chandler : So how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his?
Monica : Excuse me?
Chandler : We're talking about sperm donors, and Zack may be the guy.
Chandler : Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic. l mean, he's sperm-tastic!
Monica : Chandler, this is crazy. Well, what did you even say to him?
Monica : ''Come up. Meet my wife. Give us your sperm.''
UNK: l invited him to dinner so you'd get a chance to get to know him.
UNK: With a sperm bank, you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
UNK: -Chandler! -l'm telling you, he's great.
UNK: l mean, even if my sperm worked fine, l think he'd be the way to go.
UNK: l'm not going to be a part of this.
UNK: You can't bring some random guy home and expect him to be our sperm donor.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: -Zack? -Thanks.
Zack : Do you have a coaster? l don't want to make a ring.
Monica : Tell me about yourself, Zack.
Rachel : Oh, God, do you think she heard? lt'd be so bad if she heard.
UNK: Maybe she didn't hear. l'll go into that dressing room and talk. You stay here.
Phoebe : -See if you can hear me. -Okay, great.
Rachel : Oh, thank God, l can't hear a word that you're saying.
UNK: -l didn't say anything yet. -Well, get back in there and talk.
UNK: l'm Rachel.
UNK: lt's so annoying when l put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
UNK: Okay, well, l heard that. Which means that she heard it too.
Phoebe : -We have a problem. -Oh, what are we gonna do?
Stranger : Just be honest with her.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: lt is annoying when parents put babies on the phone.
UNK: All right, enough out of you!
Charlie : Thank you.
UNK: Where did l go wrong? This is good stuff.
UNK: -Hello? -l need to talk to Charlie. ls she there?
