UNK: Well...
Phoebe : ...great that you're back. How are you?
David : -Good. Good. Life is good. -Good.
UNK: Well, l'm seeing someone.
Phoebe : -Good for you. -Yeah.
David : She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and....
UNK: lt's actually because of you that we're together.
UNK: l mean, l saw what you had with that Mike guy...
UNK: ...and l just said, ''Boy, l want that.''
UNK: -Mike and l broke up. -You're kidding me.
UNK: Because l'm not seeing anybody. l just totally made that up.
UNK: -Really? -l don't know why, l'm sorry.
UNK: l guess l just didn't want to lose face.
UNK: l understand.
UNK: Yeah. Okay. So then, okay....
Phoebe : So we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone.
Phoebe : -That's so not like us. -Yeah, l know.
David : Well, this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that...
UNK: ...but do you have someplace that you need to be right now?
UNK: Well....
UNK: No.
UNK: -Well, do you want to get a drink? -l'd love to.
UNK: -Great. -Okay.
David : Do you smell beets?
UNK: All right, stay upwind of me.
Charlie : Hey, there's Phoebe. ls that Mike she's with?
Rachel : No, that's David.
Charlie : There's a third guy?
Rachel : Tip of the iceberg.
UNK: l'm gonna take off now.
Zack : You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
UNK: Sure you don't want to stay a little longer?
UNK: No, l should get home. l'm kind of tired.
Chandler : Are you always tired?
UNK: Because that could be a sign of clinical depression.
UNK: No, it's tiring to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died.
UNK: -l'll see you tomorrow. -Okay.
UNK: Bye.
UNK: l think we found our sperm.
UNK: He does seem pretty perfect.
Chandler : Yeah? You think so? Should l ask him?
UNK: No.
Chandler : Why not? Just because his great-grandmother was obese?
UNK: Our kid's gonna get that from you anyway.
Monica : No, that's not it.
UNK: lt's just that when we were asking him all those questions before...
UNK: ...l just realized l don't care if he is the most perfect guy in the world.
Monica : -He's not you. -Yeah, he's better!
Monica : No, he's not.
UNK: lf l can't get pregnant with you, then l don't want to get pregnant by him...
Monica : ...or anyone else.
Chandler : -Really? Are you sure? -Yeah, l'm sure.
UNK: Thank God, because l don't wanna do this either.
UNK: l was just doing it because l thought that was what you wanted.
UNK: l'm the husband. l'm supposed to bring the sperm.
Monica : That is so sweet.
UNK: l love you.
Chandler : So you know this leaves us with....
UNK: Adoption.
Chandler : How do you feel about that?
UNK: l think l feel okay about it.
UNK: Actually, l think l feel really good about it.
Chandler : Me too.
UNK: l wanna find a baby that needs a home, and l wanna raise it with you.
UNK: And l wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Monica : So this is it? We're really gonna adopt?
UNK: Yeah.
Monica : -Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents! -We are gonna be great parents.
UNK: And it could be soon.
UNK: l mean, think about it. Right now, somewhere out there...
UNK: ...our baby could be being conceived.
UNK: Wait. lf we're lucky, and we're really, really, really quiet...
Chandler : ...we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking.
Chandler : Hey, Zack.
Zack : Hey, Chandler.
UNK: l wanted to apologize for last night.
UNK: l got the feeling we made you uncomfortable.
Zack : -No, you didn't. -Really?
Zack : No, you did.
UNK: My wife and l have some boundary issues.
Chandler : Sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.
Chandler : We're working on it.
Jeanette : -Here are the boards for Friday's pitch. -Thank you.
Chandler : You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would you?
