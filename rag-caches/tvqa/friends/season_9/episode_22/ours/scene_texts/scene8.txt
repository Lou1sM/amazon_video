Joey : Wow! You look...
Joey : ...stop-eating hot!
Joey : Which is like the highest level of hotness.
UNK: Okay, are you sure? Because l am really dreading going to this party.
Joey : Then don't go.
UNK: Mike knows l'm coming. lf l don't show up, he'll think it's because of him...
UNK: ...and then l'm gonna lose face. That's a very serious thing in my culture.
UNK: All right, then you go to that party, and you pretend to be over Mike.
Joey : Afterward, you come to my place and l'll get you good and drunk.
UNK: You got it. Okay.
Phoebe : But not on the wine that you made, okay?
UNK: Because l just don't want to go back to the emergency room.
UNK: l'm sorry, l don't seem to have enough cash.
UNK: You would accept rubles, would you?
UNK: This is a hundred-thousand-ruble note, which is worth approximately...
UNK: ...nothing.
UNK: -David? -Phoebe! Hi.
Phoebe : -Oh, my God! -Hi.
David : Wow! You look unbelievable.
UNK: Oh, yeah, well....
Phoebe : What are you doing here?
UNK: Well, l'm back from Minsk. Permanently.
UNK: Well, what happened?
UNK: Remember how l was trying to achieve...
David : ...the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
UNK: Yeah.
David : Well, after eight years of research, l discovered...
David : ...that it can't be done.
UNK: -Oh, l'm sorry. -lt's all right.
UNK: This kind of thing happens all the time in science.
UNK: To people who base eight years of research on a typo in a scientific journal.
