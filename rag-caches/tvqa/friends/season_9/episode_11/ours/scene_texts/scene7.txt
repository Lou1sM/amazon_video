UNK: Hey, good morning, lover.
UNK: l gotta say, after last night, l'm a little weak in the knees.
Ross : Here's an idea. You walk into a room, take a quick scan.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: But l kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
UNK: Oh, God, l have to tell you something.
Chandler : You're not pregnant.
Monica : What are you talking about?
UNK: Well, that thing that l have to do to make a baby?
UNK: l faked it.
Monica : What? You faked it?
Joey : You know what?
UNK: l don't need a tie.
UNK: l mean, it's better open collar, you know?
UNK: lt's more casual.
UNK: Joey. Listen, l can't do this. lt doesn't make any sense.
Joey : Sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. lt's okay.
UNK: Well, it's not okay, because l gave a very memorable performance as the nurse.
UNK: And now, suddenly, l'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
UNK: Well, maybe you are a nurse...
Joey : ...but you moonlight as a waitress.
UNK: Because l'm a single mother supporting my two children.
UNK: Nice.
Rachel : Wait a minute.
UNK: Dr. Drake Ramoray and l work at the same hospital. Wouldn't l come say hi?
Joey : No. No, see, you and Drake are having a fight.
Monica : About what?
Joey : He slept with you-- Best sex you ever had, by the way.
Joey : And then never called you.
UNK: And l just wanted a new daddy for Davey and Becky.
Director : Okay. Okay, from the top.
UNK: And, action.
UNK: So l'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
UNK: l'm surprised too. But yet, here l am.
Director : Cut! Cut!
Director : What are you doing?
UNK: l'm very angry at him because he slept with me and never called me back.
Extra : -Me too. -Me too!
Joey : Calm down. She means on the show.
Joey : We need some new extras around here.
Gavin : Wow. You're here already.
UNK: Yes. Emma and l came in a little early to do research on the presentation.
UNK: Actually, l made a few changes. l think l'm caught up on everything.
Rachel : So ask me anything.
Gavin : -How do you fix the chair? -Except that!
Rachel : Hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
UNK: -Good, because it's in 1 0 minutes. -What? l can't do that. l have the baby.
Rachel : Ross is not gonna pick her up for an hour.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Then Gavin can give the presentation. We have to do it now.
UNK: Mr. Zelner : Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.
UNK: But l love that man. l'd follow him into hell.
UNK: Microphones.
Rachel : Well, there you go, you win. You win.
Rachel : You get to do the presentation. You'll knock them dead.
UNK: No one will remember that l worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...
Rachel : ...and Super Gavin will just fly right alongside of him.
Gavin : -You can do the presentation. -No, l can't. l have a baby.
UNK: l'll watch her.
Rachel : Why would you do that?
UNK: Because you worked really hard, and it's your job. And you're a little crazy.
Rachel : That's really nice.
UNK: l should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
UNK: Well, you're not gonna like what's coming.
UNK: l'm sorry, l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
UNK: God.
Rachel : Thank you. Thank you.
