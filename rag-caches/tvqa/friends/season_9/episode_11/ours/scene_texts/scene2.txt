UNK: Hey, Joey. Look at me.
UNK: l'm a nurse.
Joey : Yes, you are.
UNK: l think it might be time for my sponge bath.
UNK: Sorry, l'm just so used to hitting on the extras.
Joey : -So are you excited about your scene? -Yeah, but l'm a little nervous.
UNK: Relax. Don't be. They'll probably just make you stand in the background.
UNK: -Good. -You. Here, come here. Here.
UNK: Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on ''action.''
UNK: Walk over to the operating table, stop on the blue mark and put the tray down.
Director : Don't walk too fast.
UNK: But don't dawdle.
Phoebe : Okay. Now, what?
UNK: And, action!
