UNK: Wait, you don't have my phone number.
Ross : You know what? lf it's meant to be, l'll guess it.
UNK: Bye-bye.
UNK: Score.
UNK: Did you not like her? Because l was hoping we could come...
UNK: ...to your kissing parties on the balcony.
UNK: l can't believe you are making a big deal about this. lt was one kiss!
Rachel : -One guy. One time! -Oh, really?
UNK: -Yeah. -Oh, really?
Monica : Oh, yeah.
Ross : -What about the guy from the bar? -Who?
Ross : The guy you gave your number to.
Rachel : -How do you know about that? -Because he called here looking for you.
UNK: So don't tell me kissing this guy from work is a one-time thing.
UNK: Because you've been out there in bars and on balconies...
UNK: ...for over a month now. And you don't even have the courtesy to tell me.
UNK: -Why didn't l get that message? -What?
Rachel : From the guy in the bar? Why didn't l get that message?
UNK: Because l folded it up and put it in my pants pocket.
Ross : Do you not look there?
UNK: Ross.
UNK: l never gave it to you.
UNK: Why?
UNK: -l don't know. -Oh, God, you know what? l don't....
UNK: Who do you think you are? Who are you to decide...
Rachel : ...what messages l should or should not get?!
UNK: Who am l? l'm the guy who's taking care of our baby...
UNK: -...while you're at bars meeting guys! -l cannot believe you.
UNK: l actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us.
UNK: But l can't do that with someone who hides my messages...
UNK: ...and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
UNK: Hey, none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!
UNK: That's not the point, okay? The point is...
UNK: ...you are the one who moved on and didn't tell anyone.
UNK: Oh, God, Ross, this is just so messed up.
UNK: What is wrong with us? When people hear about our situation, they ask :
UNK: ''You live together, but you're not a couple, yet you have a baby?
UNK: lsn't that weird?'' And l say, ''No. lt's not, because it works for us.''
UNK: But you know what? This doesn't work.
UNK: -ln fact, this is the opposite of working. -Clearly.
Rachel : And you know...
UNK: ...we said that we would live together as long as this makes sense...
UNK: ...and maybe this just doesn't make sense anymore.
Ross : Yeah, maybe not.
UNK: So, what do you wanna do?
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Can Emma and l live here for a while?
UNK: God.
Joey : -Of course. -Thank you.
Joey : Your eyebrows look weird.
UNK: So you'll just touch yourself for anything, then?
