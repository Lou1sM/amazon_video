Joey : Hey, let me ask you guys something.
UNK: l'm having new headshots taken tomorrow.
Joey : The photographer said she thinks l should have my eyebrows waxed.
UNK: ls that weird for a guy?
Phoebe : -Well, it depends. -On?
UNK: On how far along he is in the sex-change process.
UNK: No, l totally disagree. l think it's fine for a guy to do something like that.
UNK: Especially an actor.
UNK: l mean, not that you need to. Your eyebrows are....
Joey : Stop it, you guys. Stop staring, you're freaking me out.
UNK: Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.
UNK: Oh, man, now l have to get those done too?
UNK: -Wow, talk about high maintenance. -You dye your hair.
UNK: -l'm a woman. -Double standards!
UNK: Before l forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
UNK: -Only if l don't have to get up and sing. -But everybody sings. lt's so fun.
UNK: Last time, this adorable old man got up there, forgot all the words, flipped out...
UNK: ...and everyone booed him off the stage. lt was so funny.
UNK: Look, l'm not good at singing.
UNK: Oh, what's the matter? You scared? You afraid l'm a better singer?
UNK: You afraid l'm gonna beat you at singing?
UNK: Nope. Nope. lt's not working on me.
UNK: Wow, l must be growing up.
UNK: Okay, fine. Just please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
UNK: So l don't have to sing, and l can just sit there and pass judgment on others?
Phoebe : -While drinking. -l'm there.
UNK: Hi, you guys. Listen, l really need your help.
UNK: l think l did something really stupid.
Phoebe : Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something so beautiful out of it.
Rachel : No, not that. l kissed Gavin last night.
Phoebe : -My God. -You kissed him?
Rachel : Yeah, it was after the party, we were on the balcony--
UNK: Wait, wait, wait. l was at home the whole time. How did l miss that?
UNK: Well, it was the end of the party. You were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Monica : Oh, yeah.
Monica : So how did you end up kissing?
Rachel : We were all alone and he was being really nice...
Rachel : -...and he gave me this scarf. -l thought you hated him.
UNK: Well, there is a thin line between love and hate...
Rachel : ...and it turns out that line is a scarf.
Monica : Are you thinking of starting something up with this guy?
UNK: l don't know. lt's so complicated. l work with this guy.
UNK: l have the baby, and l have Ross. l don't know what to do.
UNK: And l have to be at the office and see Gavin in 1 0 minutes.
Monica : Sounds like you need to think about what you want and talk to Gavin.
Monica : -And you definitely should talk to Ross. -Or...
UNK: ...l could call in sick and not deal with it at all.
UNK: Wow! Five months maternity leave, you're back for four days...
UNK: ...kiss a co-worker and call in sick. They are lucky to have you.
UNK: -Hi. -Hi.
UNK: -l'm here for my eyebrow appointment. -Name?
Joey : Chandler Bing.
UNK: Okay, very good.
UNK: Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing, and Sonya will be right with you.
UNK: Okay. Thanks.
