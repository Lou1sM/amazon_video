UNK: -Hey. -Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.
UNK: Look, can we talk about what happened here last night?
Chandler : Sure. Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you.
UNK: You believe that whoever did something last night did what they did or didn't do?
UNK: Okay, you really don't know what l'm talking about?
UNK: -No. -Okay. Last night, after the party...
UNK: ...l saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Chandler : Our balcony? Seriously?
UNK: That's so funny. l told Monica we should put lights on our balcony...
UNK: ...and she said, ''No, no. lt's too cold. Nobody will go out there.'' And l said :
UNK: ''Maybe if we put some lights out there they will.''
UNK: Right, that's what l came over to talk about. l saw Rachel kissing some guy...
Ross : ...on your balcony, even though there were no lights!
UNK: So are you gonna talk to her?
UNK: Why? Why should l? l mean, if she wants to move on, that's fine.
UNK: You know when ''that's fine'' sounds true? When someone yells it and spits.
UNK: No, l'm serious. l mean, if she wants to date people, fine. l don't care.
UNK: But at least she could have told me.
UNK: You know, l've been putting my life on hold and concentrating on Emma.
UNK: But if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows, then so will l.
UNK: Very funny! Ross is gay!
Chandler : No, no. Good, so you're moving on.
Chandler : Do you have any idea where you're moving on to?
UNK: l've got plenty of opportunities.
UNK: Just now, there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me.
UNK: And then the other day on the subway, a woman ''accidentally'' sat on my hand.
Chandler : Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life.
UNK: And there's an anthropologist at school...
Ross : ...who totally came on to me during the interdepartmental potluck dinner.
UNK: Why did l get married?
