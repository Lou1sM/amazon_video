Rachel : -Who is it? -Gavin. l brought you some soup.
UNK: -Why? -l heard you were sick.
UNK: Oh, right! Hold on, let me just clean up in here a little bit.
Rachel : Hello, Gavin.
UNK: l missed you at work. How you feeling?
UNK: l'm not gonna lie to you, l'm pretty sick.
UNK: Oh, good. Because l was having a totally paranoid moment...
UNK: ...where l thought you called in sick to avoid me.
Rachel : Oh, no, no, no.
UNK: So l had fun last night.
UNK: So did l.
Gavin : Exactly how contagious is this thing you have?
UNK: ls it a cold from standing on the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?
UNK: -lt's just a cold. -Do you have a fever?
Gavin : Let me see.
UNK: What? What is it? What's the matter?
Gavin : What's Ross doing to you in that picture?
Rachel : Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.
Rachel : He thought it would be funny.
Gavin : -Right. Right. -Yeah.
UNK: -Ross. -Yeah.
UNK: What's the deal with you guys? l don't wanna get in the middle of anything.
UNK: You're not getting in the middle of anything. Don't worry about Ross.
UNK: Hide! That's Ross! Hide!
UNK: -Hide! Hide! -Yeah, but you said not to worry--
UNK: l lied and l'm not sick either! Just stay behind the curtain!
UNK: -Hi. -Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.
UNK: No. l'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
UNK: Right. Yes, yes.
Molly : -Don't panic. -What?
Molly : There is a man behind your curtain.
UNK: -l have Mace in my purse. -No, that's okay! No, no, no.
Rachel : This is my business associate Gavin being silly. Come out from behind there.
UNK: Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.
UNK: lt was my idea to stand there.
UNK: -Hello. l'll just go get Emma. -Okay.
UNK: So...
UNK: -...why did l have to hide? -l thought it was Ross.
UNK: l thought there was nothing going on between you.
UNK: There isn't. There totally isn't.
UNK: You hear keys in the hall and you jump like a bronco coming out of the chute.
UNK: l used to be a rodeo clown.
Rachel : All right, look, Gavin...
UNK: ...l guess l felt guilty that you were here...
UNK: ...which l shouldn't.
UNK: You know, Ross and l are not in a relationship...
UNK: ...but he is the father of my child. And, you know...
UNK: ...we do live together. And plus, there's just so much history, you know?
UNK: lt's just-- l don't know.
UNK: -l'm sorry. l'm just all over the place. -lt's okay.
UNK: lt's probably not my place, but can l give you a piece of advice?
UNK: -Yes. -You should talk to Ross about all this.
Rachel : People keep saying that.
UNK: l'm sorry, Gavin.
Gavin : Don't be.
UNK: lt's just bad timing.
UNK: So seriously, rodeo clown?
Gavin : One of the best, ma'am. One of the best.
