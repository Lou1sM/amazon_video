UNK: l touched the stuff.
UNK: l'll take care of it.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: So do you...? Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Sonia : -Oh, absolutely. -Oh, good.
Sonia : -You looking to meet somebody? -All right, let's just do this.
UNK: Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.
UNK: First, l want to tweeze some of the strays, okay?
UNK: -Now, this may sting just a little bit. -l have an extremely high threshold--
UNK: Holy Mother of God! Oh, my face! My face!
UNK: l'm all right. l'm all right. l'm all right.
UNK: lt's just a bit of shock, that's all.
UNK: -But l'll be fine. You can go again. -Okay.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Damn it, woman!
UNK: lt's the most eligible man in New York. How's the moving on going?
UNK: Not well. l went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand...
Ross : ...but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Chandler : Maybe you're going about this the wrong way. l mean, think about it :
Chandler : Single white male, divorced three times, two illegitimate children.
UNK: The personal ad writes itself.
UNK: You know, that's funny. Yeah. So do you think you'll ever work again?
UNK: What are you doing? You know l can only dish it out.
UNK: l can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.
Chandler : Maybe she didn't move on.
Chandler : Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive, one-time birthday thing.
UNK: No, a month ago, she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Chandler : -Did she go out with him? -No. When he called...
UNK: ...l threw the message away.
Chandler : The high road.
UNK: All right, you know what? Enough. Enough talking. l have to get moving.
UNK: Hey, check out those two blonds over there. Hey, come with me.
Chandler : Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Ross : You don't have to do anything. lt'll just be easier if it's two of us.
UNK: Like college, remember? First, you break the ice with some kind of a joke...
UNK: ...so they know you're the funny one. l swoop in with interesting conversation...
UNK: ...so they'll see that l'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one.
UNK: l thought l got to make the jokes.
Ross : -Don't you have to be at work? -Oh, come on.
UNK: Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler. This is my friend Ross right here.
Chandler : We were wondering...
UNK: ...if you're up for it, we only need six more people for a human pyramid.
UNK: Swoop. Swoop.
UNK: Hey, l notice you're reading the paper.
UNK: Another flood in Europe, huh?
UNK: Here's a question :
UNK: Would you rather drown or be burned alive?
UNK: -l'm sorry, we're just leaving. -Okay.
Chandler : We still got it.
