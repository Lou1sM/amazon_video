Monica : What's the big deal with her?
Monica : Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Ross : Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.
Ross : You know, when it's right there in your face.
UNK: Me, l like to have to work to find someone attractive.
UNK: Makes me feel like l earned it.
UNK: Looks like Joey's doing all right with her.
Monica : Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off...
UNK: ...and let Joey get the girl for once.
UNK: -l'm gonna take her to the apartment. -Okay. l'll be home right after work.
UNK: -Okay. -Okay, bye, Emma.
UNK: l love you.
UNK: -Bye. -Bye.
Monica : They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk.
UNK: lt's not so good.
UNK: l think it's sweet.
UNK: Ross, Joey And Chandler : Bye, Emma!
UNK: Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, l would really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Joey : -Why not? -lt took months to find a good nanny.
UNK: And l wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
UNK: So you think l'm just gonna sleep with her...
UNK: ...and never call her again, and things are gonna get uncomfortable?
UNK: Yeah, that sounds about right.
Ross : Come on, there are plenty of other women out there.
UNK: Just forget about her, okay? She's off-limits.
UNK: Oh, man! What'd you have to go and say that for?
UNK: Now that you told me l can't have her, makes me want her even more!
Ross : -What are you, a child? -Yes!
UNK: lt's true. He's like a little boy, like Ben.
UNK: Just think of him as a really, really, really horny Ben.
UNK: No!
UNK: Look, Joey, come on now. For me, please.
UNK: Just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
UNK: Fine.
Monica : Take me home.
UNK: Do you want a piece of this?
Phoebe : -Hey, Mikey. -Hey, Pheeb.
Phoebe : -What are you doing? -Setting rattraps.
Phoebe : -To kill Bob? -No. No, to test his neck strength.
UNK: No, l don't want to kill him. l thought we were gonna capture him...
Phoebe : ...and, you know, set him free in the countryside...
UNK: ...where he could meet a friendly possum...
Phoebe : ...and a wisecracking owl.
UNK: -Okay, okay. l'll throw away the traps. -All right, l'll find Bob. l'll get him.
UNK: Bob? Bob?
UNK: Robert?
UNK: Wait, l think l hear him.
UNK: Oh, my God! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
UNK: We'll have to think of a new name.
UNK: l don't know, l kind of like ''Bob'' for a girl.
UNK: No, no. l mean, l'm not sure that we--
Phoebe : Oh, my God. We killed Bob?
UNK: Well, maybe it wasn't Bob. Maybe it was a mouse.
UNK: Susie?
UNK: That's it?
UNK: lt's over?
UNK: Who shot J.R.?
UNK: Who shot J.R.?
UNK: l have got to get a job.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: Seriously, dude. Three years ago.
Ross : Listen, can you do me a favor? l'm gonna be out today.
UNK: Can you keep an eye on Joey...
Ross : ...make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Chandler : -You don't trust him? -Well, no.
Ross : Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier...
Ross : ...and asked for her daughter, the ''hot nanny.''
UNK: ls this your long-term plan, for me to run interference?
UNK: Because l could get a job any day now.
Ross : You do appear right on the cusp of something.
UNK: Look, come on, man. l'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two...
UNK: ...but for now, could you please just do this for me?
