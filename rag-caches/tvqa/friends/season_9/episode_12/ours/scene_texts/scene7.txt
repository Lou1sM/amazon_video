UNK: -l'll see you tomorrow. -Okay.
UNK: Well, Joey, l guess we have no problem.
UNK: lt's like my favorite fairy tale come true.
Joey : The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian.
UNK: Okay. Okay, you start preparing the formula...
UNK: ...and l'll start changing the box.
Phoebe : And then we gotta put them straight to bed.
Mike : When did we become one of those couples...
UNK: ...whose lives revolve around their rats?
Phoebe : Well, you know what? They're our responsibility now.
UNK: Okay, fine. These rats are our responsibility.
UNK: What happens when they mate and there are hundreds?
Phoebe : Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
UNK: Yeah, not such a problem with rats.
UNK: No, they're more of a ''love the one you're with'' kind of animal.
UNK: No. Really?
UNK: Oh, my-- Get off your sister!
UNK: Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
UNK: The-- We have seven rats.
Phoebe : So, what if each of them has seven rats...
UNK: ...and then each of those has seven rats? That's like....
UNK: That's math l can't even do!
Phoebe : What are we gonna do?
UNK: Well, l know this is gonna sound crazy...
Mike : ...but we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
UNK: Yeah, okay. l guess you're right.
UNK: All right, so we should just give them away.
Phoebe : But to nice families with children and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.
UNK: Those were Bob's favorites.
UNK: lt's gonna be okay.
UNK: -You must think l'm crazy. -No, l think you're sweet.
UNK: Good. This is just so hard. lt's hard for me to let them go.
UNK: l guess it just brings back memories, you know...
UNK: ...from when l gave birth to my brother's triplets and l had to give them up.
UNK: l haven't told you about that yet, have l?
Rachel : Thanks for the party, honey. Should l help you clean up?
Monica : No way. You had your party. Now l have mine.
UNK: -ls everything all right? -l just get bummed...
Rachel : ...when my birthday's over.
Monica : Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about.
UNK: That jerk, Gavin, from your office didn't show up.
UNK: Yeah, l hate him.
Monica : We weren't talking about you. We were....
UNK: No. No way to recover. No. Okay.
UNK: -Fun party. -Well, it was.
UNK: And you would have seen it if you didn't show up at....
UNK: 9 : 30?! God! This party was lame.
Monica : Again, you're welcome!
UNK: -Look, l'll just give you this and go. -You bought me a present. Why?
Gavin : Let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents...
Gavin : ...and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person.
UNK: Okay, l....
UNK: l got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you.
UNK: Well, okay. Well, that's very nice. And you wrote a card.
Rachel : -''From Gavin.'' -l really mean it.
UNK: lt's beautiful.
UNK: lf you don't mind...? Let me.
UNK: Well, what do you know, it fits.
Rachel : See, Gavin. You're capable of being a nice guy.
UNK: Why do you give me such a hard time?
UNK: l'm not sure.
Rachel : Well, Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
UNK: l do have feelings for you.
Ross : -You do? -Yes. l feel that you're a little annoying.
Rachel : See, why? Gavin, why?
UNK: Right when l'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you--
Rachel : And you do that.
Rachel : Hey. Listen, l think l left something here.
UNK: Well, somebody left this. ls this yours?
UNK: No, but l like it.
UNK: No, l think l left one of my rat babies.
UNK: Well, no. l haven't seen it, but if l do, l'll let you know.
Monica : Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Phoebe : Maybe that's him.
