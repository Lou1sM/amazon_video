UNK: ...so l'll just wait till it's finished.
UNK: -What? -l was giving you an apology...
Rachel : ...and you were totally checking her out.
UNK: l wasn't. l'm in fashion. l was looking at her skirt.
UNK: Or was it pants? l didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
Rachel : Wow, you are really.... You're really a creep.
UNK: What do you care if l was looking at her?
Gavin : Are you jealous?
UNK: Oh, yeah. l'm jealous.
Rachel : ''Oh, Gavin. Please, please look at my ass.''
Rachel : Stop looking at my ass!
UNK: l mean, l just think you are totally inappropriate. Okay?
Rachel : This is a work environment. She's your subordinate.
UNK: But it was okay when you slept with your old assistant, Tag?
Rachel : That is totally different for two reasons.
One : l didn't know that you knew that.
UNK: And two : l wasn't some creep staring at his ass.
UNK: We had a.... We had a deep, meaningful relationship.
UNK: What was Tag's last name?
UNK: lt was....
Rachel : Oh, my God.
UNK: He didn't-- He didn't-- He didn't have a last name.
UNK: lt was just Tag, you know, like Cher or...
Rachel : ...you know, Moses.
UNK: But it was a deep, meaningful relationship.
UNK: You know what? My first impression of you was absolutely right.
Rachel : You are arrogant. You are pompous. Morgan! Morgan!
UNK: -Tag's last name was Morgan! -lt was Jones.
Rachel : What are you, his boyfriend?
UNK: -Man, l wish l had a nanny like you. -You mean when you were a baby?
UNK: Sure.
Monica : Would you stop staring at her?
UNK: l wasn't staring.
UNK: l was leering.
