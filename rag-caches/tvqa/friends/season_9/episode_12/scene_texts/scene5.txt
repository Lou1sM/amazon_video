UNK: ...the tuna tartare or the mushroom empanadas?
UNK: -The pile of raw fish, or the tacos? -Oh, the tacos. Definitely, the tacos.
UNK: l still can't believe you invited Gavin.
UNK: He is just the last person l want to see.
Monica : You're welcome for the party. l'm glad you're having a good time.
UNK: l hope he doesn't show up. Of course he won't, the guy hates me.
Monica : -Does he? -What?
UNK: Maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you.
UNK: lt's like in first grade when Skippy Lange would push me...
Monica : ...because he secretly had a crush on me.
Rachel : Monica, you think Skippy liked you?
UNK: Honey, all those boys had a bet to see if he could knock you over.
UNK: -She's out. l'm gonna take her home. -Okay. Thank you.
UNK: Bye, sweetheart.
UNK: Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Monica : Wouldn't kick her out of bed.
Monica : No more vodka for me.
UNK: Hey, Rach. So can l sing ''Happy Birthday'' to you now?
Rachel : -Yeah, sure. -All right.
Joey : See you later.
Monica : Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.
Rachel : Give me!
UNK: -Wow. Wow. Oh, my God! -Careful! Careful!
Phoebe : These are my rat babies!
Mike : Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Rachel : You brought rats to my birthday party?
Monica : So this is what a stroke feels like.
UNK: Well, l had to bring them. We killed their mother.
Phoebe : They're our responsibility now.
Phoebe : You know, they require constant care. You should know that, you're a mother.
Rachel : Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Phoebe : No. Seven rats.
Phoebe : We should take them home. We need to feed them.
Rachel : You're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
UNK: Well, l'm sorry, Rachel, but l'm not like you. Okay?
UNK: Not everyone can afford help.
UNK: Hey, where the hell are Joey and Molly?
UNK: l asked you to watch them.
UNK: l'm sorry. l got a little preoccupied.
UNK: Look, we have to stop them before something happens.
Chandler : Right behind you, big guy.
Joey : So you see, Molly, what people don't understand...
UNK: ...is that acting is a discipline. lt takes a lot of hard work.
UNK: -So where'd you study? -l didn't go to college.
UNK: -No, where'd you study acting? -Molly, people don't study acting.
UNK: Molly, do you mind giving us just a minute?
UNK: -Sure. l'll go check on Emma. -Thanks.
Joey : Will the stable boy never get the princess?
Ross : What do you think you were gonna do, have sex with her here on my couch?
