Phoebe : Hey, Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
UNK: -Lima. -No.
UNK: lt starts with a V and ends with an X.
UNK: And hopefully with a T-O in the middle.
UNK: You know, come to think of it, the capital of Peru is ''Vtox.''
Mike : -Oh, God! -What?
UNK: Okay. l don't want to freak you out or anything...
UNK: ...but l just saw a rat in your cupboard.
UNK: Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.
UNK: Well, he's your pet rat?
Phoebe : Well, not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor...
UNK: ...who l put food out for. Kind of like Santa.
Phoebe : Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
UNK: You can't keep a rat in your apartment. They're unsanitary.
UNK: l mean, they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
Phoebe : -What are those? -l don't know...
Mike : ...but they don't sound like spa treatments.
UNK: -You have to get rid of it. -Okay, fine.
UNK: lf it means that much to you, l'll get rid of Bob.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: lt's so weird you think he's so gross, yet you're willing to eat his crackers.
