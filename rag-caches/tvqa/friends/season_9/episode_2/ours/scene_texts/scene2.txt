UNK: Hey, Gunther. Can l get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
Gunther : -Diapers, huh? -Yep.
UNK: So l guess Rachel had your baby?
Ross : -Yep. Can you believe it? -Nope.
UNK: l can't even believe she slept with you in the first place.
Ross : You mean, like....
UNK: Hey.
UNK: l know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
UNK: Actually, we don't.
UNK: Fine. Okay. But l gotta say, technically, l didn't even do anything wrong.
UNK: What? You didn't do anything wrong?
UNK: -l said l didn't technically. -Okay.
UNK: Let's put aside the fact that you ''accidentally'' ...
Ross : ...picked up my grandmother's ring and you ''accidentally'' proposed to Rachel.
UNK: Can l just stop you there for a second?
UNK: When people do this :
UNK: l don't really know what that means.
Joey : You were saying?
UNK: And l could even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel.
UNK: But why couldn't you tell me? You had all day to, and you didn't.
UNK: l know. l should've. ''l'm sorry.''
Ross : Not using it right, Joe.
UNK: ''l'm sorry.''
UNK: -l'm gonna go. -No, come on.
Joey : -Ross, we have to get past this. -Give me the bag.
UNK: No, l don't know what else to do. l said l'm sorry, now....
UNK: Now you should scream at me or curse me or hit me.
UNK: -l'm not gonna hit you. -You'll feel better. l'll feel better.
Joey : You know you want to, l can see it in your eyes.
UNK: -l don't. -A little bit.
UNK: -No. -Little bit.
UNK: -No. -A little bit more.
Ross : -Give me the bag. Give me the bag. -No, hit me. Hit me.
UNK: -Give me the bag. l'm not kidding. -Hit me.
UNK: -No. -Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!
Ross : -You ducked! -l'm sorry! lt was a reflex!
Ross : -Oh, my God! This really hurts! -l couldn't help it.
Joey : When a fist comes at your face, you duck. Look.
Ross : What is the matter with you?
Joey : You were supposed to duck! Why didn't you?
UNK: Let's talk on the way to the hospital.
UNK: Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes.
Monica : -Try feeding her again. -l already fed her.
UNK: l know. That's why l said, ''Again!''
Joey : You guys, we can't turn on each other, okay?
UNK: That's just what she wants.
UNK: -Hi. -Hey.
UNK: l told you you shouldn't have let her watch Terms of Endearment.
UNK: -Can l talk to you outside? -Just stay here.
