UNK: You said you'd marry Joey?
Rachel : Okay, you have to realize, l was exhausted, l was emotional.
UNK: l would have said yes to anybody.
Rachel : Like that time when you and l got married.
UNK: l'm not helping.
Ross : So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Rachel : That is right. And traditionally, the daddy gives the mommy a present.
UNK: But l am prepared to let that go.
UNK: So when l came here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again...
Ross : ...you were engaged to my best friend?
UNK: Well--
UNK: Really?
UNK: l thought Chandler was your best friend.
UNK: Well, Chandler's my oldest friend. Joey's my-- No!
UNK: Hey, l'm gonna take off. l just wanted to say goodbye.
UNK: Rachel said she'd marry you?
UNK: This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.
UNK: l don't want to be negative. So l'll say most of the signs you bought are good.
UNK: No, they ran out of ''lt's a Girl!'' But l can fix this one.
UNK: See? Huh?
UNK: So sexy.
UNK: -Honey? -Yeah?
UNK: -Honey, why don't you lie down? -lt's okay.
Chandler : Ross and Rachel will be back soon, and then l gotta go to the office.
UNK: Am l producing them?
UNK: -Why are you so tired? -l couldn't sleep last night.
UNK: l started worrying about this big divisional meeting l have today.
UNK: The more l worried, the more l couldn't sleep.
UNK: You know, and then l was, like, ''lf l fall asleep now, l'll get six hours' sleep.
UNK: But if l fall asleep now, l'll get five hours' sleep.''
UNK: No matter what l did, l couldn't fall asleep.
UNK: You know what you should've done? Told yourself that little story.
UNK: -Hi. -Hey.
Everyone : -Welcome home. -Hi.
Monica : Phoebe did the signs.
Rachel : You guys, thanks for doing this.
UNK: Look at all that stuff people sent.
UNK: Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something every mother needs.
Rachel : A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment.
Rachel : What are people think--? You guys, l love it.
UNK: Hey, so where's Ross?
UNK: He's downstairs getting the stuff out of the cab.
UNK: -ls he still mad at us? -Well, you more than me.
UNK: But he can't stay too mad at me. l mean, l just had his baby.
UNK: That's not fair. l can't do that.
UNK: l'm not sure you should be here when he comes up.
UNK: l didn't think l should be here either. But somebody said he'd be over it.
UNK: Hey, what do l know? l wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
UNK: The numbers we're seeing in Chicago, New York and London are solid.
UNK: But many of our field offices have reported disappointing yields.
UNK: Ms. Mckenna : Boston is down. Atlanta is down. Houston is down.
UNK: l could go on and on. But instead of boring you...
UNK: ...l'll go straight to my 42-point plan.
UNK: Walter.
UNK: She's just so cute.
UNK: l just want to bite her ear off and use it as a sucking candy.
UNK: Phoebe.
UNK: But l could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
UNK: -Okay. l put most of the stuff away. -Oh, great. The pacifiers?
UNK: -lt's in the cupboard. -The burping cloths?
Ross : -Linen closet. -The diapers?
UNK: ln the hospital.
Phoebe : -Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy. -No, l left the diapers at the hospital.
UNK: There's some in the bag, but l'll run out and get some more.
