UNK: No, l know Ross. But what's it short for?

Ross : Just Ross.
UNK: lt's pretty.
Joey : -Okay, date of birth? -You know my birthday.
UNK: Sure.
UNK: May...tember?
UNK: -October 1 8. -Occupation? Dinosaurs.

UNK: The drawing is not.
UNK: All right, who do you want as your emergency contact?
UNK: -Rachel, l guess. -Okay. Relationship?
Joey : Boy, this could take a while.
Ross : -Just put roommate. -Come on.
UNK: You guys are more than that. You're gonna get together, right?
UNK: l don't think that we are.
Joey : But you two are supposed to be together.
UNK: Well, l thought so too. But then she said she'd marry you.
Joey : Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything.
UNK: She'd just had the baby. She was freaked out about doing it alone.
UNK: -She would have said yes to anybody. -Yeah, that's what she said.
UNK: -So? -So l don't want to be just anybody.
UNK: -Wow. -You know what?
UNK: lt's better this way anyway.
UNK: l don't know what l was thinking, going down that road again with us.
UNK: lt's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah.
UNK: -And you're okay with that? -Yes. That's what we always planned.
UNK: And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.
UNK: That's why they call them plans. Hello?
UNK: l'm fine.
UNK: Hey, for what it's worth...
UNK: ...with Rachel, l don't think you'll ever be just ''anybody.''
Ross : Hey, there you go.
UNK: ''Thanks.''
Monica : Oh, my God. How long has she been crying?
