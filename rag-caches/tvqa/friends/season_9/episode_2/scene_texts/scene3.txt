UNK: l'm gonna check her diaper. Pheebs, you want to come?
UNK: l'm kind of part of this.
UNK: Actually, it's a husband-and-wife kind of thing.
UNK: l knew l should've married Chandler.
UNK: -Okay, what's up? -Okay.
UNK: You know we said it would be fun to move to Paris for a year?
UNK: And you could study French cooking, and l could write...
UNK: ...and we could picnic along the Seine, and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.
UNK: -Yeah. -Okay.
UNK: You know how people say that Tulsa...
UNK: ...is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Monica : What? Who says that?
UNK: People who have never been to Paris?
UNK: -Well, what's going on? -We're moving to Tulsa.
Monica : -Excuse me? -Okay.
Chandler : Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss.
UNK: -l think you actually met her. -Don't care. Get back to Tulsa.
UNK: She asked me to move to Tulsa and be president of our office there.
UNK: And l was sleeping and apparently said yes.
Monica : -Tulsa, Oklahoma? -The Sooner State.
Chandler : Whatever that is.
UNK: Chandler, l don't even want to see the musical Oklahoma.
Chandler : ''Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,'' ''Surrey With the Fringe on Top''?
UNK: Are you trying to tell me we're moving to Oklahoma or that you're gay?
UNK: l don't think l can get out of this.
Monica : -Oh, my God! -But you don't know...
UNK: ...it could be like Paris. You can still take a cooking class...
UNK: ...at Oral Roberts University.
Monica : All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
Chandler : No. But they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.
UNK: -l'll get out of it. -Thank you.
Chandler : -What is wrong with Emma? -She misunderstood.
Monica : She thought she was moving to Tulsa.
UNK: Ma'am, do you have a minute?
UNK: l kind of have some bad news. l don't think l can move to Tulsa.
UNK: -What? -lt's a funny story, actually.
UNK: l kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning.
UNK: So when l said l'd move to Tulsa, l didn't really know what l was saying.
UNK: Ms. Mckenna : You fell asleep?
UNK: But only because l was up all night worried about this meeting.
UNK: lsn't that funny?
UNK: lrony. Not a fan? All right.
UNK: See, here's the thing.
UNK: l went home and told my wife about Tulsa, and she won't go.
UNK: See me, l love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven. Tulsa is ltaly.
UNK: Please don't make me go there.
UNK: -Chandler, l-- -l know that you're upset...
UNK: ...but l just-- l would really rather just stay here.
UNK: Not here in your office...
UNK: ...here at the company...
UNK: ...where l'm rapidly feeling unwelcome.
Chandler : No, look, Carol. Can l call you Carol?
UNK: Why would l when your name is Elaine?
Chandler : What a great picture of your son. Strapping.
UNK: That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it?
UNK: Well, she's lovely. l like a girl with a strong jaw.
UNK: l'll call you from Tulsa.
Joey : Hey. So how is it?
UNK: -l broke my thumb. -Your thumb?
UNK: That's weird. Are you sure you're punching right?
Joey : Make a fist.
Joey : Maybe later.
UNK: Ross, l feel terrible.
Ross : You know what, you can go. l just have to fill out some forms.
Joey : You want me to help you with that?
UNK: Why, does it look like l'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
UNK: Name?
