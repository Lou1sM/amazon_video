Phoebe : Hey, Ross.
UNK: l'm so glad someone's here. Could you zip me up?
UNK: -Sure. -Thank you.
Phoebe : Can you believe no one between my apartment and here...
UNK: ...offered to do that for me?
UNK: People.
UNK: So why are you so dressed up?
Phoebe : Mike's picking me up for a date.
UNK: How's that going? ls it getting serious?
UNK: l don't know. l don't know. l mean, l like him.
UNK: But am l ready to take my Grade A loins off the meat market?
UNK: l'm not quite sure.
UNK: You know, l really admire your whole dating attitude.
UNK: lt's so healthy. l'm always like, ''ls this moving too fast?
UNK: ls this moving too slow? Where's this going?''
UNK: l know. You are a bit of a drama queen.
UNK: You're so much better off. You just go from guy to guy having fun...
UNK: ...and not worrying that it never turns into anything serious.
UNK: l wouldn't say ''never.''
UNK: You know, there is that guy.
UNK: Okay, well, what about...?
UNK: Okay, there's gotta be someone.
UNK: -There isn't! That's what l'm saying. -Oh, my God, you're right!
UNK: l know. And yet, here you are, all ready for the next date.
UNK: l can't believe l never realized this before.
UNK: l'm in my 30s, and l've never been in a long-term relationship.
UNK: Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?
Ross : There's nothing wrong with you.
UNK: l mean, you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married.
UNK: l want to get married!
UNK: No, please-- Please don't cry because of me.
UNK: l don't know what l'm talking about, okay? l've been divorced three times.
UNK: At least you've been married.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! l want to trade lives with Ross?!
UNK: Phoebe.
Phoebe : -What's wrong? -Nothing. l'm excited about our date.
Phoebe : Mike, this is Ross Geller. Ross, this is Mike--
UNK: -Sorry, l didn't catch that. -Mike Hanigan.
Phoebe : -Ross Geller. -Hey.
UNK: So are you sure you're ready to go?
UNK: How do l look?
Ross : -Do you have a compact in your purse? -No.
Ross : You look great.
Monica : -Hey, Joey. -This girl won't turn around.
UNK: l can't tell if she's hot or not. What do you think?
UNK: Joey, l am not going to objectify women with you.
Monica : But if her face is as nice as her ass....
UNK: -Mama! -All right. Thanks.
Joey : -Have you talked to Chandler? -He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
Joey : -How come? -l don't know. He has to work.
UNK: There's some big rush on the....
UNK: Damn it. l'm gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
Joey : Why don't you fly out there and surprise him?
UNK: l'd love to. l really miss him.
UNK: But l can't. l have one day off and it's just too expensive.
UNK: lnteresting. So Chandler's not worth the price of a plane ticket to you.
UNK: Of course he is.
UNK: Maybe l will go.
UNK: We'll have a little second honeymoon at the Tulsa Ramada.
UNK: You should bring your black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
UNK: -How do you know l have one of those? -Didn't until just now.
Joey : Hot. Not hot.
UNK: Hot!
