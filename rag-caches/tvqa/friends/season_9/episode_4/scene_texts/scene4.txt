Ross : Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.
UNK: l went over there, you know, to tell him how....
UNK: How great you are. But....
UNK: Well, you know me. Blah-blah-blah.
UNK: -And l ended up telling him that.... -What?
UNK: You had a six-year-long relationship...
UNK: ...with a guy named Vikram.
Phoebe : What? Why?
Ross : Well, he seemed...
UNK: ...to bum hard when l told him you'd never been in a serious relationship.
UNK: lf you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend...
UNK: ...l swear to Lucifer...
Phoebe : ...a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
UNK: l think you'll feel differently when you know...
UNK: ...a little bit about Vikram.
UNK: Okay, he's a....
UNK: He's a kite designer.
Ross : And he used to date Oprah.
UNK: l'm not going along with some lie you made up, Ross.
UNK: -l'm just gonna be honest with him. -Good.
Ross : Just be honest with him.
UNK: -l have nothing to be ashamed of. -No.
UNK: So l haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer than a month.
UNK: Okay? l haven't had a real boyfriend.
UNK: lf he can't handle it, then he can leave. Which he will.
UNK: And, you know, that's okay. So l'll just be alone forever.
UNK: You know, all right. lt'll be fine. lt'll be fine.
UNK: l'll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians.
UNK: -l'll get it. -Okay.
UNK: l'm trying to remember the last time l opened a door and you weren't there.
UNK: Phoebe, are you okay?
UNK: Yeah. There's just....
UNK: There's something you should know.
UNK: Vikram just called.
UNK: So it was really a shock after 25 years of marriage...
UNK: ...my parents getting divorced. l took it the hardest...
UNK: -...because l was the youngest. -Sure. Yeah.
Joey : How can you not remember me?
UNK: What?
Joey : How could you not remember that we slept together?
Hayley : -What? When? -l don't know!
UNK: l really, really think l would remember sleeping with you.
Joey : Come on, come on. Search your brain, all right? lt was...
UNK: ...a certain amount of time ago. l was here. You were here.
UNK: We had sex here, here, here....
Joey : Not there.
UNK: -Anything? -No, it's not ringing any bells.
Joey : My God, woman!
UNK: How many people have you been with not to remember this?
UNK: Hayley's Roommate : Hey, Hayley. We really gotta fix that doorknob.
UNK: Joey?
UNK: l slept with you!
Joey : And you obviously remember me! Hey, l still got it!
