UNK: -Monica? -ls everything all right?
UNK: Yeah, everything's great. l was just...
Chandler : ...watching some regular television there.
Chandler : What a pleasant surprise.
UNK: -l'm gonna go freshen up, okay? -Okay, honey.
Chandler : That was close.
UNK: -Hello. -Hey, Rach, it's me.
UNK: Okay, l just got to Chandler's room, and l caught him...
Monica : ...molesting himself.
Rachel : That couldn't have been pretty.
Rachel : But you know, guys do that.
Monica : Well, the weird part is...
Monica : ...he was getting off... to a shark-attack show!
UNK: -No! -Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!
UNK: -While watching sharks? -Yeah.
Rachel : Are you sure that's what he was doing?
Monica : You know how many times l've seen him jump up like that?
UNK: Believe me, l know what he was doing.
Rachel : Man! Sharks!
UNK: l always knew there was something weird about that dude.
Rachel : You promised to love him no matter what.
UNK: ''What'' means, like, if he gets a disease or kills someone.
UNK: Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.
Rachel : You know what, honey? Guys are just different.
Rachel : They like things that we can't understand.
UNK: l once dated this guy who wanted to pretend...
UNK: ...that he was an archeologist, and l was this...
UNK: ...naughty cavewoman who he unfroze from a block of ice.
UNK: Are you talking about my brother?
UNK: l didn't disguise that very well, did l?
UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
UNK: l went out with this girl last night. Halfway through our date l realized...
UNK: ...l already slept with her.
UNK: You've slept with all the women in N.Y., and now you're going around again?
Joey : That's not even the weird part.
UNK: -She didn't remember sleeping with me! -You don't remember sleeping with her.
Joey : But she should remember sleeping with me. l am very memorable!
UNK: -You guys know. -How do we know?
UNK: -We've never slept with you. -And whose fault is that?
Monica : What's the big deal? You forgot, she forgot.
UNK: -Maybe you were having an off night. -Hey!
UNK: l never have an off night. Okay?
UNK: Although, sometimes if l'm a little bloated, l don't feel that sexy.
UNK: But even then, l'm better than most!
Monica : Honey, why don't you just let it go and ask her out again?
UNK: You're both so slutty, you don't remember who you slept with.
Rachel : You're made for each other.
UNK: lnteresting.
UNK: Well, l'll go out with her again and l'll try to get past it.
UNK: No salt! Bloaty!
UNK: -Joey? -What?
Monica : You don't think sharks are sexy, do you?
UNK: No.
Joey : Wait a minute. Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?
UNK: lt's open!
UNK: -Hey. -Mike called! We're going out again!
Ross : Quick thing. l went to talk to Mike.
UNK: What?
UNK: What did you--? What did you do, Ross?
