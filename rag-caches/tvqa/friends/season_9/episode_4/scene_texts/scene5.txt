Joey : So we're good.
UNK: l'll let myself out.
UNK: And l said, ''Okay, Vikram...
Phoebe : ...you can't just call every time you get lonely.
Phoebe : You gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.''
UNK: Rachel? l thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Phoebe : Yeah, well....
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: But Emma's birth certificate might say ''Geller'' ...
UNK: ...but her eyes say ''Mukherjee.''
Mike : That is so wrong. And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?
UNK: l know. But he calls, and my heart goes to him.
UNK: You know, that bastard is one smooth-talking freelance kite designer.
UNK: lf you want, l'll mess him up for you.
UNK: You would do that?
UNK: Unless he's big. lf he's really big, l'll send him...
UNK: ...a rude letter.
UNK: l think there's somebody better out there for you.
UNK: l mean, you know, l'm-- l'm not saying me, but....
UNK: Maybe...me.
Mike : And you don't have to worry about glue-sniffing with me.
UNK: Although, l do smell the occasional Magic Marker.
UNK: Yeah. Anyway, l just....
UNK: l think l can make you happy.
UNK: -Okay, l can't do this. -What's wrong?
UNK: Well, there is no Vikram. Ross made him up.
UNK: Because l....
UNK: l really never have been in a long-term relationship.
UNK: l've never lived with a guy. l've never even celebrated an anniversary.
UNK: So....
UNK: lf that's too weird for you...
UNK: ...and you want to leave, l understand.
UNK: ln fact, l'll close my eyes to make it less awkward.
Phoebe : You kissed me.
