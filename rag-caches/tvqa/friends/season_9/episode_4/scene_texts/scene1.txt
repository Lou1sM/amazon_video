Hayley : Excuse me?
UNK: l said that l think you're hot.
UNK: And...now l'm embarrassed.
UNK: l thought you said ''hi.''
Joey : That would've been better.
UNK: l'll try that. Hi, l'm Joey.
UNK: l'm Hayley.
UNK: Look, l don't normally ask out women that l meet in coffeehouses.
UNK: Gesundheit.
UNK: But....
UNK: This is hard. l'm kind of shy.
UNK: Seriously, you should see someone about that cold.
UNK: lf it gets much worse, you could die.
UNK: -Anyway-- -l would love to go out with you.
Joey : Really? Great.
UNK: Did l--? Did l actually ask you?
Hayley : That's just where you were going. l figured l'd help you out.
Hayley : You don't seem like the kind of guy who does this a lot?
UNK: Damn it, Gunther, you gave it to me.
UNK: Oh, it's you.
UNK: With vegetarian corndogs.
UNK: Come on, l just want to talk to you.
UNK: About what? How few ova l have left?
UNK: Come on, l just wanna apologize for what happened yesterday.
UNK: l'm sorry, Phoebe.
UNK: That's okay, Ross.
Ross : -So how'd the date go? -Well, it was awful.
UNK: l barely got through dinner.
UNK: Every time l thought about what you said, l cried.
UNK: l'm pretty sure he spent most of the night just staring at me in horror.
UNK: But l couldn't know for sure because my eyes were swollen shut.
UNK: You know l wasn't trying to make you cry.
UNK: l was really trying to say something nice.
UNK: l was basically saying even though you've never been in a serious relationship--
UNK: -Are we gonna do this again? -Sorry.
Ross : -So he hasn't called? -Would you call this girl :
UNK: ''Thanks for...a lovely...evening''?
UNK: Now l feel terrible. This is all my fault.
Joey : You know what you should feel terrible about?
UNK: This could have been my serious guy.
Phoebe : He was sweet and smart and funny.
Phoebe : You know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
Ross : We are a rare breed.
UNK: Hey, maybe that's him.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Could you hold on one sec?
UNK: -l need some privacy. -ls it Mike?
UNK: No, it's a heavy breather. l'll take what l can get.
UNK: l'm listening.
Hayley : What a great dinner.
UNK: Thanks again for letting me have that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
UNK: You're welcome again. l'm gonna go make some coffee.
UNK: -Can l get you anything? -Do you have any cake?
UNK: So this is going pretty good.
UNK: Dinner was nice. We've got a lot in common.
UNK: Victoria's Secret.
