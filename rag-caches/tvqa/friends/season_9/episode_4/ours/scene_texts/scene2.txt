UNK: We even like the same books.
UNK: There's a scary painting.
UNK: Wait a minute.
UNK: I think I've been scared by that painting before.
UNK: You know what? This whole place looks familiar.
UNK: I have definitely been in this apartment.
UNK: I know I've seen this weird plant before.
UNK: It did that the last time!
UNK: Oh, my God. I've gone out with this girl before.
UNK: Yeah! We had sex on this couch!
UNK: And then on that chair, and-- No.
UNK: No, we didn't do it here...
UNK: ...which is weird, because it seems like a perfectly good place.
Mike : That's why.
Ross : Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop by like this. Can l come in?
UNK: Sure.
Mike : Who are you?
UNK: l'm Ross. Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse?
UNK: l really, really need to talk to you about something.
UNK: Unless....
Mike : You're not gonna try and get me to join a cult, are you?
UNK: No, it's just, you know, you have that look.
UNK: Damn Supercuts!
UNK: -Well, what's up? ls Phoebe okay? -Oh, yeah, yeah.
Ross : Phoebe is great. But....
UNK: l'm an idiot, okay?
UNK: Right before you guys went out...
UNK: ...l accidentally got her all upset.
Mike : That's why she was weird.
UNK: Yes. Yeah, l....
UNK: Yeah, l said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship.
Ross : But you should know, she is so much fun. A wonderful person.
UNK: -Please, don't blow her off. -l'm not gonna blow her off.
UNK: l just spoke to her. We're going out tomorrow night.
UNK: l mean, l hope that's okay with you, stranger from the coffeehouse.
UNK: That's great. So the crying didn't turn you off?
UNK: l just got out of a nine-year relationship with a manic-depressive.
UNK: Compared to that, Phoebe's a Mousketeer.
UNK: Well, then, l didn't need to bother you.
Ross : You or the four other Mike Hanigans l bothered.
UNK: One of whom was quite large and a little flirty.
Mike : Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. ls that true what you said?
UNK: Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Ross : Of course she has.
UNK: lf she's never had a serious relationship...
UNK: ...do you think l'd go around broadcasting it...
UNK: ...like some kind of unstoppable moron?
Mike : -But you did say it. -Yes. Yes, l did.
UNK: And l will also say...
UNK: ...what l'm about to say...
Ross : ...the following.
Ross : Phoebe has never had a serious relationship...
UNK: ...since...
UNK: ...her super-serious relationship...
UNK: ...with...
UNK: ...Vikram.
UNK: -Vikram? -What? That's a real name.
Chandler : Stop it!
Chandler : Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas?
UNK: Seven o'clock.
UNK: Maybe l'll hit the gym.
UNK: Who am l kidding? Pay-per-view porn.
