Phoebe : Trick or treat.
UNK: -Hey. -And ''treat'' it is.
UNK: Wow. So glad l changed.
UNK: l almost wore my threadbare robe that can't contain my breasts.
UNK: This is not what l'm wearing. l'm ovulating...
UNK: ...and Chandler's gonna be home. So, l thought we would try before dinner.
UNK: Oh, l thought we'd all go over together.
UNK: All right, l'll just meet you there at dinner.
UNK: Unless, l mean, if it helps, l could stay and watch.
UNK: -No! -Well, l didn't want to anyway.
UNK: You know, just thought l'd be polite and offer.
UNK: Wait, does this mean you'll be late?
UNK: We haven't seen each other in over a week.
Monica : We'll probably be the first ones there.
UNK: Okay. See you there. Happy humping.
UNK: Hey. Well, hey!
Phoebe : Wow, somebody smoked out here?
UNK: My God, don't people know you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
UNK: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legal in offices with fewer than 1 5 people.
UNK: Oh, you smoked.
UNK: No. l just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states.
Chandler : For example, in Hawaii, cigarettes are called lei-lana-lukus.
UNK: -Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes! -Do you think Monica will smell it?
UNK: Are you kidding? That woman has the nose of a bloodhound.
UNK: And the breasts of a Greek goddess.
UNK: Pheebs?
UNK: l'm gonna go.
Chandler : Okay. Something to cover the smell.
UNK: Oven cleaner.
UNK: Unscented.
Monica : Welcome home.
UNK: l've missed you.
UNK: -You want to join me in the bedroom? -No, thanks, l'm good.
UNK: Okay. So you want to play it that way, do you?
UNK: Well, you know what, actually, l just got off a plane...
UNK: ...so l'm feeling gross. l should take a shower.
UNK: -Come here, you don't need a shower. -All right, the truth is...
UNK: ...l soiled myself during some turbulence.
UNK: What do l smell? l smell smoke.
UNK: Did you smoke?
UNK: Yes. But l just had one.
UNK: Two.
UNK: Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.
UNK: A pack. Two pack-- A carton.
UNK: Three big fat cartons in two days!
UNK: But it's over. l've made a decision, l'm not gonna smoke anymore.
UNK: Well, those are for you.
UNK: All right. Well, we'll just see you when you get here. Bye.
UNK: Oh, that was my mom. She's stuck in terrible traffic.
UNK: That is now the third sign that l should not leave Emma.
Ross : -What are the other two? -Well, the first one is, l don't want to.
UNK: And second one, l'm not going.
UNK: l know this is the first time we're leaving the baby.
UNK: l know how hard it is for you. But....
UNK: But everything's gonna be fine. l mean, my mom is gonna be with her.
Ross : -She's great with kids. -She is?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: What about Monica?
UNK: You only hear Monica's side of that. Okay, that little fatso was a terror!
