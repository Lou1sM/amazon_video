UNK: l couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday...
UNK: ...so we'll have to do dinner Thursday night.
Joey : -Thursday? But that's Halloween. -So?
UNK: lt's just spooky, that's all.
Ross : So, is Mike coming to dinner?
UNK: No. lt's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work.
UNK: l'd get mad at him, but l think it's too soon to show my true colors.
UNK: l would make the reservation for five. One of us has to stay with Emma.
UNK: -Which one of us should go to dinner? -Rachel!
UNK: Actually, l was thinking maybe both of us could go.
UNK: Thanks. l'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift.
UNK: All right, so great, we can all go now.
UNK: That is fun! Hey! You know what?
Phoebe : We all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time.
Monica : What are you talking about? We're together now.
Rachel : Mon? Chandler's not here.
Monica : Oh, dear God.
