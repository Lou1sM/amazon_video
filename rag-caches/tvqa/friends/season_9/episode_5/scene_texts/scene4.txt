UNK: -What if she jumps out of the bassinet? -Can't hold her head up, but jumped.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! l left the water running!
Ross : You did not leave the water running. Please, pull yourself together, okay?
UNK: -Well, did l leave the stove on? -You haven't cooked since 1 996.
UNK: ls the window open? lf the window's open a bird could fly in and....
Ross : My God, you know what? l think you're right.
UNK: -Listen. -What? What?
UNK: A pigeon. No. No, wait, no. An eagle flew in!
UNK: Landed on the stove and caught fire!
UNK: The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.
UNK: The eagle, however, misconstrues this as an act of aggression...
UNK: ...and grabs the baby in its talon.
Ross : Meanwhile, the faucet fills the apartment with water.
UNK: Baby and bird, still ablaze, are locked in a death grip...
UNK: ...swirling around the whirlpool that fills the apartment!
