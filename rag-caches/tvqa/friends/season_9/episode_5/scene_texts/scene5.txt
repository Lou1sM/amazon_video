UNK: -Hello. -Hi.
UNK: lt's been an hour.
UNK: The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider switching to a smaller table.
Joey : Maybe we should just eat now.
UNK: You can't order until the entire party's arrived. Restaurant policy.
UNK: Well, how about this? Another table leaves, right...
UNK: ...but there's still some food left on their plates.
UNK: Okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eating that?
UNK: -lt's frowned upon. -But it happens.
UNK: -All right, l got to go to the bathroom. -You can't go.
UNK: No, no, no. l can't hold this table on my own.
UNK: lf they ask me to move, l'll cave.
UNK: Well, if you ask me to stay, l'll pee.
UNK: Maitre D' : Good evening, miss.

UNK: For what it's worth, l'm sorry.
UNK: l shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking.
Monica : So you had a few cigarettes. lt's not the end of the world.
UNK: -Really? -Yeah.
Chandler : You are incredible.
UNK: And listen, l'm not gonna smoke again.
UNK: And if l do, l promise l will hide it so much better from you.
Chandler : -Want to? -Let's celebrate life!
UNK: Okay!
UNK: Oh, God.
