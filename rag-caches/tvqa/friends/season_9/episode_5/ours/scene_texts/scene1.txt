UNK: Hello. lt's nice to see our team together for the first time.
Chandler : Now, before we get started, are there any questions?
Chandler : -Yes. Ken, is it? -That's right.
UNK: ls it true the reason you're in Tulsa is, you fell asleep in a meeting...
UNK: ...and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
UNK: Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken.
UNK: But yeah, that's true.
UNK: All right, let's get started by taking a look at last quarter's figures.
UNK: Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the boss's ass?
UNK: -l'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you? -No. l smoked for years. Then l quit.
UNK: Right now, l can't remember why.
Phoebe : You're not allowed to smoke in this office, right?
Claudia : Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with 1 5 people or less.
Claudia : -Would you like one? -Would Joey like two pizzas?
UNK: You don't know what l'm talking about.
UNK: All right, look. l don't smoke anymore.
UNK: But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine.
UNK: So, you all smoke, then?
UNK: You know, it's almost rude that l'm not smoking.
UNK: -That's not true. lf you don't want-- -Ken, please!
UNK: No, l can't. l can't smoke. lf l smoke, my wife would kill me.
