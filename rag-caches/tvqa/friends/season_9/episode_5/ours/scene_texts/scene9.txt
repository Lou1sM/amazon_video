Rachel : She still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.
UNK: lt's a good toast.
UNK: Look, will you please get her attention?
UNK: Mommy?
UNK: Mother.
Phoebe : Oh, for God's sake, Judy, pick up the sock!
UNK: Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!
UNK: l'm sorry, was that rude?
UNK: Did my little outburst...
UNK: ...blunt the hideousness that is this evening?
UNK: Look, l know you have a lot going on...
UNK: ...but all l wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday.
UNK: And you are all so late, and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.
UNK: Well, it's too late now.
UNK: Pheebs, l don't think that's us.
UNK: Oh, well, this is-- This is not over! Hello?
UNK: l feel terrible. We should've been strong and left Emma at home.
UNK: ''We''?
UNK: There are some adult willy stories they don't know.
UNK: We should've been stronger.
Joey : -What is going on with you two? -Well, you see, l'm ovulating.
Chandler : Oh, yeah, that's what she says.
UNK: Maybe you're not ovulating. Maybe it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.
UNK: Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was. l just can't get enough.
UNK: You're not gonna believe this.
UNK: She tricked me into having sex with her.
UNK: So? You got to have sex, right?
Chandler : What's the matter with me? Why am l such a girl?
Phoebe : -Okay. That was Mike. -Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.
Rachel : You are totally right. We are here 1 00 percent...
Rachel : ...and we love you, and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
UNK: You guys, that means the world to me.
UNK: Okay, l'm gonna take off.
UNK: What?
UNK: l love you guys too, but, Mike got off work early.
UNK: Wait.
UNK: l'm not the-- l'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends...
UNK: ...to be with her boyfriend.
UNK: You know what? l am.
UNK: Bye, guys. Judy! Bye.
UNK: lf Phoebe's gone, can we take Emma home?
UNK: That's a good idea. Our babysitter just pounded another chardonnay.
UNK: -Bye, you guys. -Bye.
UNK: See you. Well, l guess it's just us.
UNK: So, l'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
UNK: All right.
UNK: So, you've never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
UNK: Actually, Richard was a Kennedy on his mother's side.
UNK: Why did you break up with that guy?
UNK: -You're gonna go do it? -We don't have much time.
UNK: Once the egg descends into the fallopian tube--
UNK: Oh, wait, oh, get out of here!
UNK: l sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
UNK: No, just me. All alone.
UNK: Dinner for six for one.
UNK: Well, you boys are about to see something really special.
Waiter : -How was everything? -Excellent.
UNK: The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.
UNK: l hope you've got some room left.
Joey : Joey. Joey.
UNK: This is the best birthday ever!
