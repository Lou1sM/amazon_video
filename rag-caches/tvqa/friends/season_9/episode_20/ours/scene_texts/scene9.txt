UNK: Who?
UNK: Me.
UNK: What?
UNK: Really?
UNK: Yeah, because we live together. lt's a joke! lt's a joke.
UNK: Right! That's funny! l get it!
Jane : -Got you! -You're funny, Joey.
Rachel : Oh, my God.
Chandler : So how did you enjoy the play?
Rachel : Oh, my God. Honey, l am so, so, so, so sorry.
Chandler : Well, you should be.
Chandler : You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Monica : -You really liked it? -Oh, yeah. l mean, at first l hated it.
UNK: But why wouldn't l? Because as a man, l've been trained not to listen!
UNK: But after Chapter 1 6 :
UNK: Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...
UNK: ...l was uplifted.
Monica : -Oh, really? -Oh, yeah.
UNK: l had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman.
Ross : Tell me-- Tell me about your first period.
UNK: No!
Chandler : Did somebody sign your bra?
UNK: So l got it when l was 1 3. Very difficult.
Phoebe : Hey, Ross? So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl?
Phoebe : Are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?
Phoebe : What is that? Come on, a piece of paper?
UNK: lt's actually a million-dollar prize.
Phoebe : Go, Charlie!
Phoebe : But my point is...
UNK: ...okay, so she dated them, but she also broke up with them.
Phoebe : Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.
UNK: Yeah, maybe, and l do have my whole career in front of me.
UNK: l mean....
UNK: l could still win a Nobel Prize.
Ross : Although the last two papers l've written were widely discredited.
Phoebe : You're so much more than just brains. You are sweet and kind and funny.
Ross : And sexy.
UNK: Okay, well, give her a chance to see all that.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
UNK: -Thanks. l'm gonna go find her. -Good for you.
UNK: And your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian Era was topnotch.
Ross : Stop going through my stuff!
UNK: l just wanted to let you know l've changed my mind.
UNK: l'm gonna do it. l'm gonna kiss Joey.
Monica : No! You can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Rachel : Please! What about you and Chandler?
UNK: That's different. l was drunk and stupid.
Rachel : Well, hello?
UNK: What about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from?
Monica : -Why don't you just kiss one of them. -l could...
UNK: ...but l don't want to. l want to kiss Joey.
UNK: All right. l think it's a big mistake, but it's your decision.
UNK: l'm gonna do it.
UNK: -And l can't stop you? -No.
UNK: Well, can l at least have the phone numbers.
Ross : Hey, Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
UNK: l'm smarter than him!
Phoebe : Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
Chandler : This was a really important experience for me and l wanted to share it with you.
Monica : You're so wonderful.
UNK: Why Don't You Like Me?
UNK: Chapter 1 : My First Period.
UNK: l can't believe you guys bought that. Enjoy your slow death.
