UNK: Matthew Ashford : -Call me. -We will!
Monica : Look at you with all the guys! l guess you've forgotten all about Joey.
UNK: Yeah, well, l guess l have forgotten about Joey.
Rachel : And clearly, you've forgotten about Chandler.
UNK: Please. Chandler's the love of my life.
Monica : Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!
UNK: So do you get to go to things like this often?
UNK: Come on, this is New York.
UNK: l mean, one night you're at a rooftop party filled with soap stars...
UNK: ...and the next night, you're....
UNK: Who am l kidding, this is so cool.
UNK: So it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
UNK: Actually, l'm kind of happy to be leaving. l just broke up with someone.
Ross : Oh, so sad.
Ross : Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard.
UNK: Especially after working with a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.
UNK: Actually, Albie is the guy l broke up with.
Ross : -You dated Albert Wintermeyer? -Yeah.
UNK: And you called him ''Albie''?
UNK: l mean, that's like calling Albert Einstein....
UNK: Albie.
Charlie : Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
Rachel : You think? l mean, you dated the guy...
Ross : ...who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 1 0!
Charlie : Yes, and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend...
Charlie : ...he had a lot of issues.
Ross : Oh, like what?
UNK: l'm sorry. l don't mean to pry. lt's just that this must be...
Ross : ...what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood.
UNK: Okay, you want the dirt?
UNK: Albie was seriously insecure.
Charlie : He was really intimidated by the guy l dated before him.
UNK: Who's intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Charlie : A guy who won two.
UNK: Two? What--?
Ross : Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart?
Charlie : Yeah, for three years.
Rachel : Oh, my God.
Ross : Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
UNK: No.
Charlie : But there was my first boyfriend, Billy.
UNK: Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?
Charlie : No, but he did just win the MacArthur ''genius grant.''
Ross : What a loser.
Ross : Some more wine?
UNK: Hey, Ross. How's it going with Charlie?
UNK: Oh, great. After l finish my wine...
UNK: ...l'm gonna blow my average-sized brains out.
Phoebe : What's the matter?
Ross : She only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners.
Ross : Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant earlier today...
UNK: ...l put chopsticks in my mouth and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.
UNK: l always loved that.
Ross : Of course you would! Your brains are smaller than mine!
UNK: l can't compete with the guys she goes out with.
Ross : They're so out of my league.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: -Worse? -Oh, much, much worse.
UNK: l did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians.
Ross : ''Can we walk?''
UNK: -Oh, you like that? -No.
UNK: What?
UNK: Come on! l think that's funny!
Ross : Woolly mammoth.
UNK: lt's good!
UNK: l bet you're thinking that now would be a great time for an intermission, huh?
Chandler : Oh, yes. God, yes.
UNK: Well, you're not gonna get one!
UNK: Because in life, there are no intermissions, people!
UNK: Now, Chapter 7 : Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!
UNK: How could he leave me?!
UNK: l don't know. You seem lovely.
Joey : Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
UNK: Matthew Ashford : -Nice to meet you. -So, what show are you on?
UNK: l'm not an actor. l'm a professor of paleontology.
UNK: That's science.
Dirk : Hey, well, listen, l play a scientist on Days.
UNK: Yeah, my character just won a Nobel Prize.
UNK: Ross, Dirk was wondering about the woman you brought and if you guys are together?
Ross : Well, no, but....
UNK: l mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
UNK: Hey, l got a 690 on my SATs.
Ross : l'd lead with that.
Monica : That's it. Just sign right on the bra.
UNK: Monica!
Monica : Don't worry, Joe. l won't come next year!
Monica : What the--?
UNK: What do you got there?
Ross : Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
UNK: Oh, really? Let me see.
Joey : Damn, that's a lot of guys.
Joey : Are you a little slutty?
UNK: l think l am.
UNK: Let me see if l approve of any of these clowns.
Joey : -This guy wears a rug. -Well....
Joey : This guy's Canadian.
UNK: Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?
UNK: lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three, and l don't feel any different.
UNK: Pass. Pa-- Oh, pass. Pass.
Rachel : -Why? What's wrong with these guys? -Well, nothing major.
UNK: lt's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you...
Joey : ...and you deserve the best.
Rachel : Joey, you're so sweet.
UNK: lt's true, but it doesn't matter. l already know who you're going home with.
