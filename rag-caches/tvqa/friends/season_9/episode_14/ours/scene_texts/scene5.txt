UNK: Hello?
UNK: Emma?
Joey : Hey! Hi!
UNK: How are you? How are you?
UNK: Where are your babysitters, huh?
UNK: Why is the bedroom door closed?
Joey : You can't have S-E-X when you're taking care of a B-A-B-l-E.
UNK: l've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
UNK: lf it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
UNK: Look, you got stood up. Who cares?
Waiter : We're gonna show you a good time. Sit and relax.
UNK: ln fact, let me bring you a crab-cake appetizer on the house.
Ross : Wow, free crab cakes? Well, that's nice.
UNK: Although l was hoping to have sex tonight.
Ross : Just the crab cakes.
UNK: What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? You can't do that.
Waiter : -Just get out of here, okay? -l'm sorry, what's going on?
Waiter : Okay, the waiters have a little pool going.
Waiter : We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
UNK: What?!
UNK: You're making money off my misery?
UNK: Well, if you stay till 9 : 20, l am.
UNK: This is unbelievable. l have never been so insulted in my life.
Ross : Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, l'll be on my way.
Monica : Well, that was weird. You were loud and l was fast.
UNK: l think we may have really done it this time.
UNK: l wish l didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
UNK: You may want to get some more of those too.
Chandler : Where's Emma?
Monica : Oh, my God, where's Emma? Where's Emma?

UNK: Okay. Okay. l'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.
Monica : You go look across the hall, and l'll call her cell.
UNK: You better hope we're pregnant...

UNK: l can't believe l'm crying in front of you.
UNK: You must think l'm so pathetic.
