UNK: l'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Ross : Hey, Rach!
Rachel : This is the worst date ever! How could you set me up with this creep?
Phoebe : You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
UNK: l don't care. This guy is a nightmare.
UNK: All right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
Rachel : -He's not stoned. -Did he go out for a cigarette?
Rachel : -Yeah. Four times. -My dear, sweet Rach.
UNK: Phoebe to Joey : Well, our plan is working. Rachel's having a miserable time...
UNK: ...and Ross is stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
UNK: Pretty soon they'll be back together.
Phoebe : By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.
