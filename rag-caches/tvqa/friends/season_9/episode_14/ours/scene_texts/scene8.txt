UNK: Seriously, those sticks are expensive!
UNK: lt's unacceptable that you'd have sex with Emma in the next room.
UNK: -l'll have to tell Rachel about this. -Please don't. She will kill us.
UNK: Hey, l gotta. Unless....
Monica : Unless what?
Joey : Unless you name your first-born child Joey.
Chandler : -What? Why? -Hey, l may never have kids...
UNK: ...and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Chandler : Your family name is Tribbiani.
Joey : You almost had me.
UNK: Look...
UNK: ...l think l know the answer to this question, but...
Steve : ...would you like to make love to me?
Rachel : Really, really not.
UNK: lt's just as well.
UNK: lt doesn't work anyway.
Rachel : All right, well, that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Ross : -Hey, what's wrong? -l just had a rough night.
Waiter : Crab cake?
Ross : Well, what happened?
UNK: This is kind of weird to talk to you about this, but--
Ross : Monica told me you had a blind date.
UNK: -Yeah. -l did too.
Ross : But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
UNK: Oh, no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Ross : Why does everyone keep saying that?
UNK: lf it makes you feel any better, l wish my date hadn't shown up.
Ross : -That bad? -Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...
Rachel : ...and he thought it would be appropriate to give me...
UNK: ...this.
UNK: ''Female Body lnspector''?
UNK: What size is that?
Phoebe : Now wait a minute. So they're gonna name their first child Joey?
UNK: How do l get them to name the next one after me?
UNK: lt's easy. You just walk in on them having sex.
Phoebe : Oh, so they owe me, like, three Phoebes.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! Look, it's Ross and Rachel!
Phoebe : The plan is working!
UNK: Don't do the plan laugh.
UNK: The first dates we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
Rachel : You know, it is weird...
UNK: ...that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful...
UNK: ...on the same night Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
Rachel : Wait a minute.
UNK: You don't think it was intentional?
UNK: l mean, that's just stupid.
Joey : We're geniuses.
Joey : -Look at them! They're really bonding. -They're falling in love all over again.
UNK: Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.
Phoebe : They figured it out. They're coming. Run!
UNK: -Where? -Mexico!
UNK: Can you believe they're still not here?
UNK: l know. A double blind date and we both get stood up.
Ross : What are the chances?
UNK: l know, l'm so bummed.
UNK: Could we have our free crab cakes now?
UNK: -What? -We've been stood up.
UNK: And we want our free crab cakes.
UNK: -You were stood up here last night. -l know. lt hurts.
UNK: Being stood up two nights in a row has left a crab cake sized hole in my heart.
Waiter : Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight.
Waiter : Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
UNK: l have such fat hands!
UNK: l hate my dick!
