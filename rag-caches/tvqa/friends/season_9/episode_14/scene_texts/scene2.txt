Joey : -Yeah, you know, it's not that fun. -No, l think we killed it.
Chandler : Emma? Emma, look at me!
UNK: Well, l think l'll go downstairs for a while.
UNK: No, no, no! lt's okay! lt's okay! l didn't go!
Chandler : Don't cry, it's just a bit!
UNK: l'm your Uncle Chandler. Funny is all l have!
UNK: Okay, just so you know, l'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.
Monica : So don't touch yourself for the next 48 hours.
UNK: l don't do that.
UNK: l'll try to stop.
UNK: -Did you say until the 6th? -Yeah.
UNK: Today is the 6th.
Ross : No, it's not.
Chandler : Yes, it's also 2003.
UNK: Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?
UNK: l may be done ovulating!
UNK: l may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
UNK: -Go take the test, see if we're okay. -Okay.
Chandler : Tough crib.
UNK: Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks? There's only one here.
UNK: l might have checked to see if l was ovulating a couple times.
UNK: l'm not working! There's not much to do around here!
UNK: Sorry. You want a roll with that?
Chandler : Excuse me.
UNK: ls there a woman waiting at the bar?
Ross : Someone average height, dark hair? Or perhaps doing a puzzle?
Waiter : There's a drunk Chinese guy.
UNK: Well, if l'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
UNK: Can l get you another glass of wine?
UNK: l don't know if l should. l don't want to be drunk when l...
UNK: ...go home alone tonight.
Waiter : -Got stood up, huh? -lt's no big deal. lt's just a blind date.
Waiter : Are you worried your date came, saw you and left?
UNK: No!
UNK: We're okay. l'm still ovulating.
UNK: Oh, good, because as of 4 : 00 this afternoon, l am not.
Monica : So let's do this.
UNK: -l don't think l can. -Oh, come on.
UNK: l know you're not 1 8 anymore, but give it a minute.
Chandler : -Because of Emma. -Oh, my God, Emma.
UNK: Oh, sweetie, l forgot you were here.
Monica : You're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Unless...
Monica : ...maybe we do it here.
UNK: l mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
UNK: She's aware when we leave a room. She may notice if we start...
Chandler : ...canoodling in it.
UNK: -Canoodling? -Well, l can't say hump or screw...
Chandler : ...in front of the B-A-B-Y.
UNK: l don't know, l guess having sex in front of a baby...
Monica : -...isn't so.... -Horrifying? Scarring?
UNK: Something people go to jail for?
UNK: -l guess you're right. -You guess?
UNK: At that bed-and-breakfast, we didn't have sex...
UNK: ...because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
UNK: Well, what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
