Joey : -Morning, roomie. -Hey!
Rachel : You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Joey : Fifth day's a charm.
UNK: lt's so great to be back here. You're making it so easy on me and Emma.
UNK: lt's great having you back. Stay as long as you want.
Joey : And when does she stop crying all night?
Ross : Hey! You're not naked.
UNK: Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
UNK: Probably around 6. But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.
UNK: But she fell back to sleep, so....
UNK: She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
UNK: -Bye. -Bye.
UNK: Hey, l hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Joey : No, hey, it's been great.
UNK: l just want you to know that with Rachel staying here...
Joey : ...all my feelings from before are totally over.
Joey : And even if they weren't...
UNK: ...when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump....
Ross : -Yeah, that'll do it. -Wow!
Joey : So how are you?
UNK: -l'm okay. -Really?
UNK: Sure. l mean, do l wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out?
UNK: Of course. You know, l'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Joey : -Well, actually it-- -lt's not a divorce. lt is not a divorce!
UNK: Anyway, l think Rachel and l need to get on with our lives.
Ross : Maybe start seeing other people.
Joey : Wow. Really?
UNK: Sure, why not? ln fact, if you know anyone that'd be good for me...?
UNK: -Sure. l know lots of girls. -Any names come to mind?
UNK: Names?
UNK: -l was about to eat. Want something? -What you got?
UNK: Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots...
UNK: Joey checks The Refrigerator : ...strained plums. We haven't tried that yet!
UNK: Goody!
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: So how is it living with Rachel again?
UNK: l mean, apart from the great food?
UNK: l'm fine, l'm fine. lt's just....
UNK: lt's just weird what's happening with her and Ross.
UNK: Yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Phoebe : Rachel asked me if l knew anyone for her too.
Joey : -Why are they doing this? -l don't know.
UNK: They're so perfect for each other. lt's crazy.
Joey : You know what's crazy? These jars.
UNK: What is there, like, two bites in here?
UNK: l just wish they'd realize they should be together.
UNK: When they moved in together, l figured that's where things were headed.
UNK: They should be a family. They should marry and have more children.
Joey : Yes. And they should name one of their kids Joey.
UNK: l may not have kids. Someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Phoebe : You know what? Maybe once they start dating and see what's out there...
UNK: ...they'll realize how good they are for each other.
UNK: Yeah, because it is slim pickings.
UNK: l had this date last night. Yuck!
UNK: But we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.
