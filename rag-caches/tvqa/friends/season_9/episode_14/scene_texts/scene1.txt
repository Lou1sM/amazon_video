Phoebe : So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna set them up with people?
UNK: l know, that just pushes them further and further apart.
UNK: l know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...
UNK: ...so they'll realize how good they are together.
Joey : -That's a great plan. -Yeah.
UNK: You know what the best part of it is? l get to do my plan laugh.
UNK: Okay, shh! Not so loud. We don't want to wake up....
UNK: Hi. You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
Chandler : See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?
UNK: l mean, l will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.
UNK: Now if you'll excuse me, l have to get back to reading the obituaries.
UNK: l was just asking because l need someone to watch Emma tonight.
UNK: Sure we'll do it. What are you up to?
Rachel : -Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. -Oh, my God.
Rachel : -Why? What's the big deal? -l figured because you and Ross are--
Rachel : What? Slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, l'm all set.
UNK: l think it's great you're going on a date. lt sounds healthy.
UNK: l mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood.
UNK: -l'll bring her by around 7, okay? -That's perfect.
UNK: You guys are gonna have so much fun. She's at such a cute age.
UNK: A couple things. Now that she eats solid food, she poops around the clock.
Rachel : And watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it.
Rachel : She's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams, but....
Rachel : Thanks, you guys. Have fun.
UNK: Suddenly l wish l was reading my own name.
UNK: Joey, hey. l'm so excited.
UNK: -l set Rachel up with the worst guy. -All right. Who is he?
UNK: lt's a guy l used to massage. By ''massage'' ...
UNK: ...l mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
UNK: -Wait till you hear who l got for Ross. -Oh, yeah.
UNK: Okay. She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher.
Joey : -A teacher? -She's into history and foreign movies.
UNK: And she loves puzzles.
UNK: Come on, who loves puzzles?
Phoebe : Well, Ross does.
Phoebe : You're ruining the plan!
UNK: Joey, you fixed him up with his perfect woman.
Joey : -Oh, my God, you're right! -Yeah.
Joey : She even reads for pleasure!
UNK: -How do you know a woman like that? -l'm not allowed to know smart women?
UNK: -Joey? -We met at the library. l went in to pee.
Phoebe : -So now what do we do? -Well, okay.
UNK: l'll call her and tell her the date's canceled and find him somebody else.
Phoebe : What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off...
UNK: ...but we don't tell Ross. He'll go to the restaurant and get stood up.
UNK: l hear that's bad.
Phoebe : So this is great. Rachel's gonna have a terrible date...
Phoebe : ...Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realize how good they have it together.
Joey : Yes, the plan.
UNK: lt's not Santa's plan.
Ross : No, it's....
