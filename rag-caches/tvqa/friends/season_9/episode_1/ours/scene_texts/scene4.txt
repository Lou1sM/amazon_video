UNK: l didn't want to rush into anything. lt seemed like she didn't want to either.
UNK: But l don't understand how any of this happened.
Ross : What, did she find the ring in my jacket, assume l was gonna propose...
Ross : ...throw it on and just start telling people?
Phoebe : No, no. She said you actually proposed to her.
UNK: Well, l didn't! l didn't propose!
UNK: Unless....
UNK: Did l?
UNK: l haven't slept in 40 hours and....
UNK: lt does sound like something l would do.
UNK: Look, we can't stay in here forever.
UNK: lt's just, l still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex.
UNK: He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals, but this he sees!
UNK: This is okay. We're all adults here. There's nothing to be ashamed of.
UNK: Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.
Monica : Hi, Dad.
UNK: -l can still call you that, right? -Of course. l'll always be your dad.
UNK: l just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
UNK: -lt wasn't fun? -Why, why, why would you...?
UNK: Look, l just don't want you to think...
UNK: ...that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
UNK: Well, l don't think that.
UNK: Before today, l never thought of you two having sex at all.
UNK: lt was a simpler time.
UNK: The truth is, Dad, we're trying.
UNK: To kill you.
UNK: Why, why, why would you...?
UNK: We're trying to have a baby.
UNK: -What? -Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Oh, my God, this is so exciting.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Well, get back in there! l'll guard the door!
UNK: That's okay, Dad, we can wait until later.
UNK: Whoa! l don't think so. Aren't you ovulating?
UNK: Daddy!
UNK: Mr. Geller : You gotta get at it, princess.
UNK: When your mother and l were trying to conceive you...
UNK: Mr. Geller : ...whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it!
UNK: That's how l got my bad hip.
UNK: That's funny. This conversation's how l got the bullet hole in my head.
UNK: This one time l had my knee on the sink, and your mother was--
Chandler : Seriously, sir, my brains, all over the wall.
UNK: l don't think we need to hear the specific positions you and Mom had.
UNK: You're right. This is about your positions.
UNK: Now, what l saw in the closet is not the optimum position...
UNK: ...for conceiving a child.
UNK: Mr. Geller : -Although it might feel good. -l don't feel good right now.
UNK: Mr. Geller : But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.
UNK: Mr. Geller : You up to the task, sailor?
Rachel : Oh, my God....
UNK: -Hey. -Hey. Oh, l need to tell you something.
UNK: Well, now's a good time. l'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
UNK: Joey asked me to marry him.
UNK: -What? -Joey proposed to me.
UNK: -ls he crazy? You just had Ross' baby! -Well, l said yes.
Monica : What, are you crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
UNK: l'm sensing you won't throw the shower?
UNK: lt's so inappropriate. No, it is worse than that. lt is wrong.
UNK: lt is bigger than mine!
UNK: l know. Days of our Lives, thank you very much.
UNK: -You can't marry him. -Why not?
UNK: Come on, l don't want to do this alone, and he's such a sweet guy.
Rachel : And he loves me so much.
Monica : Well, do you love him?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: -Sure? -Yeah, l mean, whatever.
