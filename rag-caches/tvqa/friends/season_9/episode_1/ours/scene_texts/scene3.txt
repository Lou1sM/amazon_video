UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
Nurse : -Are you ready to try nursing again? -Yeah. Hi, Emma.
Rachel : Why do you think she won't take my breast?
UNK: lt's all right. lt takes babies a while to get it.
UNK: -But don't worry, it'll happen. -Okay.
Rachel : Okay, sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Joey : Dear Lord.
UNK: -l'm sorry, honey, what were you saying? -Yeah, look, l think that--
UNK: Because, look! She's pulling away again.
Rachel : Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
Rachel : She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
UNK: You know, l don't really know her.
UNK: Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow?
UNK: -Okay. -Are you kidding me?
UNK: This is so frustrating. Why doesn't she want my breast?
UNK: l don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
Phoebe : -Hey, wait up. -Hi.
UNK: Congratulations.
UNK: l didn't want to say anything in front of Joey. l didn't know if he knew.
Ross : What? That we had a baby? Now let's give him a little credit.
Ross : Although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
Phoebe : No, no, that you and Rachel are engaged.
UNK: -What? -Oh, it's a secret?
UNK: Goody. Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
UNK: No, Rachel and l are not engaged.
UNK: l think you are.
UNK: What are you talking about? Who told you that?
UNK: Rachel, your betrothed.
UNK: -We're not engaged. -Oh, that's right. lt's a secret.
UNK: Right, you are not engaged. l misunderstood her.
Ross : Phoebe, there is no secret, okay? l didn't propose.
Phoebe : Are you lying?
UNK: ls this like that time you tried to convince us you were a doctor?
UNK: l am a doctor!
UNK: You know what? l'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
UNK: All right. Well, me too.
UNK: -Well, should we wake her up? -No. No. Come on, let her sleep.
UNK: -She's so exhausted. -And so engaged.
UNK: Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!
Ross : Why? Why, why would she think we're engaged?
Phoebe : Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?
UNK: You know, Ross, doctors are supposed to be smart.
UNK: -l didn't give her that ring. -You didn't?
UNK: -No! -So whose ring is it?
UNK: lt's mine.
UNK: -ls it an engagement ring? -Yes.
UNK: -But you didn't give it to her? -No.
Phoebe : -But you were going to propose? -No!
UNK: l might be losing interest in this.
Ross : Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring...
Ross : ...because she wanted me to propose to Rachel.
UNK: But all l wanted to do was see...
UNK: ...if she maybe, kind of wanted to start things up again.
Phoebe : What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
