UNK: -Chandler, can l talk to you for a second? -Sure.
UNK: Dude, l just did something terrible.
UNK: That was you? l thought it was Jack.
Joey : No, no. That was Jack. Rachel thinks l asked her to marry me.
Chandler : -What? Why does she think that? -Because it kind of looked like l did.
Chandler : Again, what?
UNK: Okay, l was down on one knee with the ring in my hand--
Chandler : As we all are at some point during the day.
UNK: lt wasn't my ring. lt fell out of Ross' jacket...
UNK: ...and when l knelt down to pick it up, Rachel thought l was proposing.
Chandler : Ross had a ring? And he was gonna propose?
Ross : -l guess. -And you did it first?
Chandler : This is gonna kill him. You know how much he loves to propose.
UNK: l know. l know. lt's awful.
Chandler : Well, what did she say?
Joey : She said, ''Yes.''
UNK: You're smiling.
UNK: No, l'm not.
UNK: Yes, you are. l can tell by the way your mouth is.
Chandler : Does Ross know?
Rachel : Oh, my God. What the hell am l gonna tell him?
UNK: -Maybe you don't have to tell him. -l like that. Yeah.
UNK: lf you clear things up with Rachel, Ross never needs to find out.
UNK: But you have to do it before he hears about it and kicks your ass.
UNK: All right, let's not get carried away.
UNK: l want a baby.
UNK: Honey, we've been over this. l need to be facing the other way.
UNK: lf we have sex again, it'll double our chances of getting pregnant.
UNK: -l think that closet's still available. -l am so tired.
UNK: -Yeah, okay, but no foreplay. -Deal!
Ross : Dad, seriously!
UNK: You know, you really should see someone about that.
UNK: Noted.
UNK: l wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute. Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Are you kidding me? l could stay and look at her forever.
UNK: Actually....
UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
Phoebe : Are you all right?
UNK: -l think l just got engaged. -Oh, my God! He did it?
UNK: What? Did you know he was gonna ask me?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Are you kidding? l'm, like, the one who talked him into it.
UNK: l like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Rachel : -And you really think this is a good idea? -l just talked him into it.
UNK: Don't tell me l have to do you too?
Phoebe : -The puppet master gets tired, people. -Okay.
UNK: l don't know. lt just doesn't feel right.
Phoebe : Why? You two are so meant to be together. Everybody thinks so.
Rachel : Really? Even Ross?
Phoebe : Especially Ross.
UNK: Hey, Pheebs. You know what? l'll come back later.
UNK: Wow. Kind of a full house here.
UNK: l guess l'll just-- l'll come back.
UNK: l guess so.
Phoebe : Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
UNK: l can't say l'm surprised.
Ross : -Dad, what are you doing? -There are people in there having sex.
UNK: lt can't be me. l'm standing right here.
UNK: Mr. Geller : -Wanna peek? -No!
Monica : Come on.
UNK: You know what? l don't like you without Mom.
Monica : Come on.
UNK: We're not peeking?
UNK: Well, l'm peeking.
