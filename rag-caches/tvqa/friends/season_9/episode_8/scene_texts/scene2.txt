Joey : Oh, my God.
UNK: You're on Days of Our Lives!
UNK: Yeah.
Amy : Wow! They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Rachel : Happy Thanksgiving.
UNK: -Hey. -Hi.
UNK: So welcome. ls this the first time you're seeing Emma?
UNK: Yeah, l think so. lt's nice to meet you, Emma.
UNK: -Phoebe. -That's a funny noise.
UNK: -Pheebs? l still need some help here. -Right. Okay.
Phoebe : So it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it. For example...
UNK: ...if you look at the ground when you talk, people know you're lying.
UNK: l don't know why this is so hard for me. Lying is basically just acting...
UNK: -...and l am a terrific actor. -You are a terrific actor.
UNK: l could talk to the producers for you. l'm a great liar.
UNK: Take Monica's dress. l said l loved it.
UNK: -l hate it. -Hey!
UNK: l'm also a great moron.
Amy : -Hey. Where's the baby? -We just put her down for a nap.
UNK: Listen, l was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?
UNK: lf you guys died!
Ross : Thank you, Amy.
UNK: No, no, then l would get the baby.
UNK: lt would be just like a movie. At first l wouldn't know what to do with her.
UNK: And then l would rise to the occasion. Then l'd get a makeover and get married.
UNK: Phoebe clapping : That's a great movie!
Amy : Now, listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything...
UNK: ...because you know, you'd be dead.
UNK: But l was thinking about changing her name.
UNK: l'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
UNK: Emma.
UNK: Amy to Phoebe : Emma? Ross wants you.
UNK: Phoebe!
UNK: Amy whispering To Ross And Rachel : Why does she keep making that noise?
UNK: Honey, l don't know how to tell you this...
UNK: ...but if something were to happen to Ross or myself...
Rachel : -...you wouldn't get the baby. -Well, who would?
Ross : Well, we haven't officially asked them yet...
Ross : ...but we would want Monica and Chandler.
UNK: -Who? -You're in their apartment.
UNK: l can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
UNK: Oh, my God, l'm so moved.
UNK: l don't believe this. Hold on a second. You guys die...
UNK: ...and l don't get your baby?
UNK: Amy, see, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
UNK: We see them every day. And truthfully, you don't seem connected to the baby.
UNK: Connected? To what? She's a lump.
UNK: You know, guys, l've gotta say this means so much to me.
UNK: l mean, that you would trust me with your child.
UNK: l mean, we all know that Monica and l have been...
Chandler : ...trying to have a baby of our own.
UNK: You know, l've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but....
Chandler : That you two....
Chandler : -That you two.... -This guy?
UNK: Seriously?
UNK: Okay, it's time for dinner.
UNK: Everyone, we're using our fancy china...
UNK: ...and it's very expensive, so please be careful.
UNK: Okay, just to be clear, comedy with the plates will not be well-received.
UNK: Hey!
