UNK: l did the first time.
Rachel : You know what? You wanna know why l am not giving Emily to you?
UNK: -Emma. -Whose side are you on?!
UNK: l'm not giving you Emma because you can't handle the responsibility of a child.
Amy : Well, how hard could it be? You do it.
Rachel : You wanna know why you don't want me to have the baby?
UNK: Because you don't want me to be happy.
Amy : -You have always been jealous of me. -Jealous of what?
Rachel : Of your lack of responsibility? Your immaturity?
Rachel : Your total disregard for other people's feelings?
Amy : To name a few.
Amy : You've always been like this.
UNK: You had to have everything, and l couldn't have anything.
Amy : Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me.
UNK: l mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
Rachel : Timmy was my boyfriend, and you made out with him!
UNK: Come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
UNK: l cannot believe that l invited you here today!
UNK: Yeah, well, you know what l cannot believe? That my so-called sister...
UNK: ...gets a 30 percent discount from Ralph Lauren, and l still have to pay retail?
UNK: lt's 45.
UNK: You bitch.
Amy : You just think you're so perfect...
Amy : ...with your new baby and your small apartment.
Amy : Well, let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
Ross : Too far, Amy. Too far.
Rachel : -You take that back. -No.
Rachel : -Take it back! -No. What are you gonna do? Make me?
UNK: Hey, man, l work out!
UNK: -So do l. -l do Pilates.
UNK: -l do yoga. -Bring it on!
UNK: Put the plates in the boxes! Put the plates in the boxes!
Rachel : -Did you just push me? -Yeah, l think l did.
UNK: All right, that's it.
Monica : Forget the bubble wrap! There isn't time!
UNK: Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!
Phoebe : -Shouldn't we stop this? -Are you out of your mind?
UNK: Let's throw some Jell-O on them!
UNK: Hey, someone could get hurt.
UNK: Kick her, Rach! Kick her!
UNK: Pull her top off, Rach! Pull her top off!
UNK: Gross!
UNK: All right, that is it! This is our apartment, and you cannot behave this way!
UNK: lf you can't act your age, you shouldn't be here at all.
Chandler : Those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones that l picked out...
