Monica : Careful. Careful.
UNK: Careful!
UNK: l'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives...
UNK: ...l'll be careful until told otherwise.
Chandler : -This isn't the china we picked out. -l know.
Monica : After you left the store, l chose different ones.
UNK: -Why? -Your taste is a little feminine for me.
Chandler : Suddenly flowers are feminine?
Phoebe : Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
UNK: -Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs! -What's going on, Joe?
UNK: Listen, l need a good lie.
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : How about the whole ''man walking on the moon'' thing, you know?
Phoebe : You can see the strings, people!
UNK: No, no, no. l need a good lie to explain why l wasn't at a work thing today.
Phoebe : -Honey, you stink at lying. -l do not.
Phoebe : Really? Let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffeehouse...
UNK: ...l went to the bathroom. When l came back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?
Joey : Somebody opened the door to the coffeehouse...
UNK: ...and a raccoon ran in and went straight for your muffin. l said :
UNK: ''Hey, don't eat that! That's Phoebe's!'' And he said....
UNK: He said, ''Joey, you stink at lying.'' What am l gonna do?
UNK: Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie. l'll help you.
Joey : -Great. That'd be great. Thank you. -Sure. What was the work thing?
Phoebe : -''Pick up Grandma at the airport.'' -Oh, man!
Rachel : She's precious.
Amy : Do you ever worry that she's gonna get your real nose?
UNK: Amy....
UNK: Yes, l do. l really do.
UNK: Hello?
Amy : Yeah, hang on, one sec. Can l take this upstairs?
Ross : Sure. We don't live there, but....
UNK: Seriously? lt's just these rooms?
UNK: -l thought you were a doctor. -Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.
UNK: God, she is unbelievable.
UNK: l know. l mean, a Ph.D. is just as good as an MD.
Rachel : Sure, Ross, yeah!
UNK: lf l have a heart attack at a restaurant, l want you there with your fossil brush.
Amy : -Stupid Thanksgiving. -What?
Rachel : -What? What happened? -My boyfriend canceled on me.
UNK: l mean, l finally find a real relationship.
UNK: Someone that l can spend this day with, and then his wife comes back into town!
UNK: l swear, it's almost not even worth dating married guys.
Ross : Don't say that.
UNK: God, l was so looking forward to this.
UNK: lt was gonna be such a beautiful Thanksgiving.
UNK: We were gonna have sushi.
UNK: Amy, don't cry.
UNK: -Ross, can l talk to you in private? -Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or...?
UNK: Look, l was thinking, if it's okay with Monica...
UNK: ...l would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
UNK: l think that's a great idea. lt'll be like the Pilgrims bringing the lndians syphilis.
UNK: Look, l know she's a little tough to take.
UNK: But she has nowhere else to go, and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.
UNK: -And l would like them to bond. -l don't want them bonding too much.
UNK: l don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
UNK: Ross, she may need one. We're just gonna have to make our peace with that!
UNK: Amy....
UNK: Amy?
UNK: Amy!
UNK: l'm out in the hall.
UNK: Your baby had some sort of explosion of stink.
UNK: The bonding's going great.
