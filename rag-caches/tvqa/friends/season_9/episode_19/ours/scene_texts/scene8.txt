Phoebe : You'd better get back in that kitchen. The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.
UNK: -Okay, you have to stop playing now. -Why?
Phoebe : The only person my playing is bothering is you.
UNK: -Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on. -Get your garlic peelers off me.
UNK: Excuse me? Excuse me?
UNK: Hi, l'm Monica Geller. l'm the head chef here.
UNK: Okay, l was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever.
UNK: Quick question. By a show of hands...
UNK: ...how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?
UNK: Okay, okay. Well, l have a question.
UNK: You can put your hand down.
UNK: You made your point earlier when you spit in my guitar case.
UNK: Okay, okay. How many of you enjoyed the music outside?
UNK: Let me ask you this question. How many thought the music was fine...
UNK: ...but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?
UNK: Okay, well, who identified this restaurant's tone as ''pretentious-comma-garlicky''?
UNK: Okay, who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretension never hurt anyone?
UNK: Okay, well, all right, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine...
Phoebe : ...but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll-taking?
UNK: Excuse us.
UNK: All right, here's a question.
UNK: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy...
UNK: ...that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music...
