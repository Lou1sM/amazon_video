UNK: Come on, you get the idea. You know, we'll make our money back in no time.
Chandler : -Dude, you're shaking. -lt's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?
UNK: -Hi. -Hey.
UNK: Joey, l gotta tell you, l have been thinking all day about that scene you did.
UNK: l mean, you were amazing.
Joey : You know, the writing was good. And the director's good.
Joey : And my costar's good.
Joey : But they're not as good as me!
Rachel : You have to tell me what happens tomorrow.
UNK: l'm going over the script now. Wanna read lines with me?
UNK: Me? Oh, l'm not an actress.
UNK: -All right, l can ask Monica. -Screw her! That part is mine!
UNK: Okay, so just from the top of the page right here.
UNK: Okay.
Rachel : Hello, Drake. l'm surprised to see you here.
UNK: -l can't believe you married him. -Well, what choice did l have?
UNK: Rachel/actress : He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.
UNK: Joey/drake : So, what about us? Everything we feel for each other?
UNK: lt's over. You have to accept that.
UNK: How can l, knowing l'll never hold you in my arms again...
UNK: Joey/drake : ...or touch your skin or feel your lips...
UNK: ...knowing l'll never make love to you?
UNK: How can l accept that l can never kiss you again...
UNK: ...when it's all l can do not to kiss you right now?
Rachel : Kiss me.
UNK: What?
Rachel : Kiss me.
Joey : -Rach, it doesn't say that. -No, l'm saying it.
UNK: -But-- -Just don't talk.
Rachel : Well, that's new.
Ross : Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.
UNK: l've forgotten a couple of things.
Ross : Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?
Chandler : Thank you. Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...
UNK: ...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss, Band-Aids, shaving cream, after-shave.
UNK: And l feel like l'm forgetting something.
UNK: ls there anything else you have that l haven't asked for already?
Ross : Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
UNK: -What'd you get? -USA Today.
Ross : Nice. Put it with the others.
UNK: And l also got two more apples.
UNK: We're four short of a bushel!
UNK: God, l feel so alive. l love being in the country!
UNK: Also, got these great salt and pepper shakers...
Chandler : -...from the restaurant. -That's not cool.
Chandlers : Dude, none of this is cool.
UNK: Look, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing...
UNK: ...and taking what the hotel owes you.
UNK: For example : A hair dryer, no, no.
UNK: But shampoos and conditioners, yes, yes.
UNK: Now, the salt shaker is off limits.
UNK: But the salt....
UNK: l wish l'd thought this through.
UNK: l think l get what you mean, though. Like, the lamp is the hotel's...
Chandler : ...but the bulbs-- Oh, you already got that.
Ross : Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
UNK: -Okay, how about this? -No, no, no.
Ross : -You can't take the remote control. -Yes, but the batteries.
Chandler : Thank you. Thank you very much.
Ross : -Let's celebrate with some maple candy. -No!
Ross : At least tell me where you hid it.
UNK: -Can l ask you a question? -Yeah.
