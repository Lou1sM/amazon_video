Chandler : Yeah. That's the same as, ''lt has something to do with wind.''
UNK: l'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
UNK: l should go too. Now, tomorrow do you want to share a cab to the airport...
UNK: ...or should Mike and l meet you?
Phoebe : Mike? Who's Mike?
UNK: -Mike's your ex-boyfriend. -That's right!
Phoebe : Oh, yeah. Wow, l had totally forgotten about him.
UNK: -That's a blast from the past, huh? -No, it's okay. Honest mistake.
UNK: lt really doesn't mean anything. l mean, you know...
Phoebe : ...Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time.
Chandler : -She does? -Let's get you out of here.
UNK: Well, at least you took me down with you.
UNK: l'm so sorry. l just-- l keep thinking about Mike.
UNK: l'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together.
UNK: Why? Why do l miss Mike? That's just-- That's gonna go away, right?
UNK: -Well, l guess. ln time. -Yeah.
UNK: l mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Phoebe : You just did it again. Chandler. Your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.
UNK: Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, huh?
UNK: l wouldn't read too much into it.
UNK: Still, a girl calls you by her ex-boyfriend's name...
David : -...that's not a good thing, right? -Let me stop you there.
UNK: Because l think l see where this is going. l'm not very good at giving advice.
UNK: See, if you want advice, go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...
UNK: ...for advice about pizza toppings or a burning sensation when you pee.
UNK: l'm sorry, l just wish there was something l could do, you know?
David : -Well, you know Phoebe-- -Seriously, we're gonna do this?
UNK: l'm sorry, l just wish l could make her forget about Mike already.
David : -Why did Phoebe and Mike break up? -Because his penis was too big.
UNK: l'm sorry. That's the kind of thing l do.
Chandler : They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married.
UNK: What if you let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
David : That's great. That's great. l'll propose to her.
UNK: What?
UNK: l was probably going to do it at some point.
UNK: -No, l didn't mean now. -Well, why not? lt's brilliant.
David : ''Goodbye, Mike. We'll see you at the wedding, fella.
David : Well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding, but--''
UNK: -Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely. -Well, you're welcome.
UNK: Glad l could help.
UNK: -How do you think l should propose? -l'm pretending to read here.
UNK: l'm sorry.
UNK: Yeah. How you doing? Hey, how are you?
Joey : You said you were gonna wear a thong. Where's the thong?
UNK: l didn't mean a thong. l meant thongs.
Joey : You really should have been more clear about that.
UNK: You're never gonna guess who l just saw downstairs.
Joey : Britney Spears!
UNK: Yeah. She never misses these conferences.
UNK: -No, l just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz! -Oh, my God!
UNK: -l know! -Did you talk to him?
UNK: Oh, yeah. What am l gonna say to Kenneth Schwartz?
UNK: You could say, ''Hey, Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?''
UNK: -You ready to go? -You're gonna go now?
UNK: -l thought we could hang out. -l can't. l have seminars all day.
UNK: l promised Ross l'd look at his speech.
UNK: But maybe we could have dinner later? Out on the balcony? lt'll be romantic.
Joey : Will you wear a thong?
UNK: l will if you will.
Joey : You got yourself a very weird deal.
UNK: l'm good. l have dinner plans.
