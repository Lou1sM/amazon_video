Monica : -The sun is out! -Hey! Remember when l had corneas?
UNK: Go to the pool and reserve chairs.
UNK: -l will get the magazines and the lotion. -Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.
UNK: -No! -Damn it!
Ross : Walls are pretty thin, guys.
UNK: ''Then we have to weigh the data from recent MRl scans and DNA testing...
Ross : ...which call into question information gathered from years of carbon dating.''
UNK: Look at the woman sitting out by the pool getting tan.
UNK: She's all leathery and wrinkled. l'm so jealous!
UNK: ''Finally, factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered.
UNK: Giganotosaurus.
UNK: -Argentinosaurus.'' -Not to mention Coldsaurus.
UNK: ''And that's just the herbivores. l'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores.
Ross : Their heads are already too big.
Ross : Which is ironic, considering their stunted cerebral development.''
UNK: Really?
Ross : ''But all kidding aside, in much the same way...
UNK: ...that Homo ergaster is thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus....''
UNK: -What? -He said ''erectus.''
Charlie : -You're kidding, right? -No, he really said it.
Ross : ''And while there are certainly vast differences...
UNK: ...between these Mesozoic fossils and the example of Homo erectus....''
UNK: Erectus?
UNK: -Homo. -Right.
UNK: ''ln a very real way, we can bring the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century.''
Sarah : Thank you.
Rachel : -Really great. -Oh, thanks, guys.
UNK: l thought it was wonderful. Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.
UNK: l mean, the ideas you put forth, and from someone so young and....
UNK: Okay, now we're just holding hands.
UNK: Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach. That was really great.
Ross : -Oh, thank you. -Yeah. Oh, and so funny.
UNK: -Take it easy. -All right, thanks. Thanks so much.
UNK: l can't tell you how much it means that you were here.
UNK: You kidding? We wouldn't have missed it.
UNK: l'm back.
UNK: Okay. Well, excuse me?
UNK: -Well? -You were incredible.
Charlie : You blew them away.
UNK: l can't tell you how great it was to look in the crowd and see your face.
UNK: l mean, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
UNK: -l was not. -No, it's okay.
UNK: lt made me feel like a rock star.
UNK: Oh, my God. l'm your groupie.
UNK: Hey, l better not find you naked in my hotel room.
UNK: Look, l took it too far.
UNK: Hey, l thought you were going to the beach.
UNK: -lt's raining again. -What?
UNK: Would you look at that.
UNK: The only time the sun comes out the whole weekend...
UNK: ...is the one hour l'm giving my speech.
UNK: Someone up there likes me.
UNK: But people down here are pissed.
UNK: l can't believe it's raining again. lt's so unfair.
Phoebe : Well, on the bright side, now we won't have to see...
Ross : ...all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
