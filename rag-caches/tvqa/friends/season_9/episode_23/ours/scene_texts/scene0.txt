Charlie : -Wow, this place is beautiful! -Look at all these paleontologists!
UNK: l know. There are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.
UNK: -My God, l can't believe you're here! -l think l've been recognized.
Joey : -This happens all the time. -Dr. Geller? l am such a huge fan.

UNK: Jeez, who doesn't own a TV?
UNK: Well, actually, l don't.
UNK: Yeah, and mine broke two months ago and l still haven't gotten a new one.
UNK: Well, didn't you two come to the right convention.
Monica : David, can you help me?
UNK: l'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
