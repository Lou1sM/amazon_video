UNK: ...gay.
UNK: Actually, it's not that complicated.
Woman : Oh, my God.

UNK: Okay. Odd thing to get excited about.
UNK: No, it's just that l was engaged to a guy who turned out to be gay.
Ross : Hey! High-five!
Charlie : Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs?
Ross : My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with every day for a year.
Ross : She didn't get any fitter.
UNK: -Everybody's like, ''l knew all along.'' -l know.
UNK: lf you knew, why didn't you tell me? l mean, call, leave a note.
UNK: ''Hi. Just dropped by to say your wife's gay.''
UNK: -l know. -And then--
Ross : And then you try to make the best of a bad situation...
Ross : ...so you float the idea of a threesome.
UNK: l didn't do that.
Ross : Me neither.
Joey : Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
UNK: l know. That old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Joey : Not enough pills in the world, Rach.
UNK: What about you, huh? You're the single one. See anybody in there you like?

UNK: No.
UNK: -There is. You're blushing. -No, l'm not blushing...
UNK: ...and l'm sunburned.

Joey : Who do you like? You're not getting away that easy.
Joey : -Who do you like? -Joey, come on!
UNK: lt doesn't matter, you know? lt's not like anything's gonna happen.
