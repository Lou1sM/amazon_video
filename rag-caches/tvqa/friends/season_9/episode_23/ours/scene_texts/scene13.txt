UNK: -No! lt can't happen at all! -Why not?
Joey : Because, look, no one wants this to happen more than me, okay?
UNK: l have gone over this moment in my head 1 00 times...
UNK: ...and not once did l ever say no.
UNK: l couldn't do it to Ross.
Rachel : -But that wasn't gonna stop you before. -l know. l know...
UNK: ...but l've thought about it a lot since then, and it just wouldn't be right.

Chandler : -You really find this attractive on him? -Oh, yeah.
UNK: Are you telling me you're not even a little turned on by Monica right now?

UNK: All right, come on, Mike. You can beat her.
Phoebe : Knock that dog off her head.
Monica : -Damn it! -l sleep with him!
Mike : -Game point. -Don't get too cocky.
UNK: Remember, l won the last one.
Mike : Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
UNK: You should look in the mirror before you call yourself that.
Joey : -No! No! No! -And that's how it's done.
UNK: Okey-dokey.
UNK: You've each won a game, and l've lost what's felt like a year of my life.
Chandler : Everybody goes home a winner.
UNK: -Best of three? -That's what l'm thinking.
UNK: Should l use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Monica : -Serve the ball, chump. -''Serve the ball, chump.''
UNK: Okay, better comebacks, Mike. Better comebacks.
UNK: l got it!
