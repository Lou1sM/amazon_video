UNK: Ping-Pong? Honey, they have Ping-Pong.
Monica : -Let's play. -l don't think so.
David : -Why not? -You know how competitive you get.

Joey : As soon as it stops raining, we have got to go snorkeling.
UNK: Some kid told me about this sea turtle. lf you blow bubbles in his face...
UNK: ...he chases you.
UNK: l'm sorry, l can't. l'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
UNK: That's okay. l'll find someone else to do it.
UNK: l'd do it alone, but...
UNK: ...l don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you.
UNK: You know, l feel so bad.
UNK: l haven't seen you this whole trip. Especially last night--
UNK: Don't worry about it. lt was fine. l had the best time with Rachel.
UNK: l just felt bad for you, stuck in that room working on Ross' speech.
Charlie : Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.
Joey : Oh, well, at least we're both having fun, right?
UNK: -ls it weird that it's not with each other? -Yeah.

UNK: l think we need to talk.
UNK: Yeah, l think we do.

UNK: -Come on, you guys, it'll be fun! -All right.
UNK: -l'll play if we don't keep score. -Well, then how do we know who wins?

UNK: -Well, l'm not playing with her. -l'm out.
UNK: -l'll play you. -Okay.
Phoebe : -You don't know what you're doing. -She gets crazy.
UNK: This scar? That's from Pictionary.
UNK: l think l'll be all right.
UNK: -You want to volley a bit for serve? -Sure, if you want to.
UNK: Oh, by the way, l'm awesome.
Chandler : Oh, dear God, there's two of them.
UNK: -You ready to play? -Hell, yeah.
Chandler : -Did you know this about him? -No idea. l thought he was soft like you.
UNK: -Want to make it more interesting? -How much you thinking?
Mike : -Ten bucks a game? -Make it 50.
UNK: -l'll make it 1 00. -One thousand--
UNK: Okay!
UNK: We'll flip to see who goes first. You got a quarter?
UNK: No. Either of you girls got a quarter?
Chandler : Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him.
Phoebe : -Monica, you call it. -Heads. No, tails! Heads!
UNK: -Tails. -Oh, what are the chances?
Monica : -My point! -Oh, no, l don't think so.
UNK: Standard rules : lf at any time a player uses his nonracket-bearing hand...
Mike : ...to touch the playing surface, he or she forfeits the point.
