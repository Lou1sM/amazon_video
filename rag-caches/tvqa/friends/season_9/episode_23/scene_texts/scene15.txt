UNK: Okay, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Monica : -Honey, you don't have to do this. -Yes, l do.
UNK: l may not understand why you have to win so badly...
Chandler : ...but if it's important to you, it's important to me.
UNK: Because l love you.
Monica : But you suck.
Chandler : You're welcome, sweetheart.
UNK: All right, let's get this over with. Sudden death.
Chandler : -Whoever wins this point, wins. -Okay.
Monica : -Oh, my God. You're good. -lt's like watching porn.
Mike : And that's how it's done.
UNK: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That was so amazing.
UNK: Well, when did you--?

UNK: l kind of realized l was starting to have feelings...
Charlie : ...for someone else.
UNK: And can l ask who?
UNK: l think you know.
UNK: l think l know too, but l've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so....
UNK: -l'm sorry, we can't. -All right. All right.
