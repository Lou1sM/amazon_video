Phoebe : ...to hear cruel, mocking jokes about Mike, l'm gonna come to you.
UNK: Oh, good, because l've already thought of three. Four! l just thought of a fourth!
UNK: Okay. l mean, l know l did the right thing.
UNK: Mike never wants to get married...
UNK: ...and l shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future.
Phoebe : But pretty soon, l'm gonna miss him so much...
UNK: ...l'm gonna want to see him again, and you have to stop me.
UNK: Okay, you got it.
UNK: Unless.... Am l being too crazy about this?
UNK: All right, so there<i>'s no future. But that doesn</i>'t mean we still can't have fun.
UNK: -You know what? Forget what l said. -Really?
UNK: -All right, if that's what you want. -That was a test, and you just failed.
Monica : Damn it! Rookie mistake!
UNK: l have sex with dinosaurs?
UNK: l believe l read that somewhere.
UNK: Not only is it not funny, it's physically impossible! Okay?
UNK: Depending on the species, l'd have to have a 6-foot-long-- lt's not funny!
UNK: l respectfully disagree.
UNK: l can't believe you put that on my alumni page.
Chandler : -Who cares? Nobody reads those. -You better hope not...
UNK: ...because l just read what you put on your page.
UNK: -l don't have a page. -Oh, l respectfully disagree!
UNK: Huggsy?
UNK: Huggsy?
UNK: Huggsy.
UNK: l want my penguin.
UNK: Look at you. All sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel.
UNK: <i>With Emma'</i>s chubby little hands wrapped around you.
UNK: lt's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.
UNK: Step away from the crib! l have a weapon!
UNK: lt<i>'s okay! lt</i>'s okay, Rach! lt's me! Put down the scrunchie.
Rachel : -What are you doing? -Well, l heard Emma stirring...
UNK: ...so l came in to make sure she could reach Huggsy.
UNK: Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that l'm up, l'm gonna go to the bathroom.
UNK: Okay, there you go, sweetie.
UNK: This isn't over!
Monica : Wait a second. Why would Ross tell everyone in your class...
UNK: ...that you are ''as gay as the day is long''?
UNK: Because l told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
UNK: Well, that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Chandler : Would you get that, please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife.
Monica : Yeah. Well, it came as quite a shock to me too!
UNK: Well, l guess l should've known. He just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Chandler : Hang up! Hang up!
Chandler : And that was a great movie.
UNK: l'm so gonna get back at Ross.
UNK: Oh, yeah, this'll show him. Here we go.
Rachel : -What are you doing? -Oh, you'll see, my friend!
UNK: l'm dead?
Chandler : And so young.
UNK: Posting that l died? That really isn't funny.
Chandler : Well, how you died was funny.
Ross : Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?
UNK: lt kills over one Americans every year.
Ross : Unbelievable. My classmates are gonna think l'm dead.
UNK: My professors. My parents are gonna get phone calls!
UNK: You're messing with people's feelings here.
UNK: You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt...
UNK: ...Professor Stern was when l told him l wouldn't be able to go to Key West!
UNK: You've really crossed a line here. But that's okay.
UNK: Because l'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software...
Ross : ...and a stack of gay porn.
UNK: That's right. Your coming-out is about to get real graphic!
UNK: God, l wish Mike were here.
Monica : Okay, if Mike were here, what would the two of you be doing?
