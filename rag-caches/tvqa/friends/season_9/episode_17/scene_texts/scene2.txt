Monica : What are you, animals? lt's 4 : 00 in the afternoon.
UNK: l gotta call him. Just to talk to him. There's no harm in that.
UNK: That's how it starts. ''l don't need to eat the cake, l'll just smell the icing.
UNK: Why not just a little sliver?'' Or, ''Okay, just a slice or two.''
UNK: The next thing you know, you're 21 0 pounds...
UNK: ...and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide!
UNK: -That's not true, is it? -They had to cut me out...
UNK: ...with the Jaws of Life.
UNK: Phoebe, honey, l know this is hard.
UNK: But look, if you talk to him, then you're gonna want to see him.
UNK: And if you see him, you're gonna wanna get back together.
UNK: And l know that's not what you want.
UNK: All right, so give me your phone.
UNK: Here.
Monica : -And now your cell. -Okay.
Joey : There you go.
UNK: -This is your cell phone? -Yes.
UNK: This is your current cell phone?
UNK: Yes. lt reminds me of a simpler time.
UNK: Phoebe? Where's your purse?
UNK: -Hey! No! -No!
Monica : -Give it to me! -You can't have it!
Monica : -Give it to me! -No!
UNK: -l'll go in there! -Oh, yeah.
Monica : -Phoebe, come here! -No!
Monica : -Give it to me! -You're crazy!
Phoebe : Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
UNK: Don't even think of sneaking out and using a pay phone...
UNK: ...because l am everywhere, baby!
UNK: Hey, look who's here. lt's Joey. And he brought home a friend.
UNK: Emma's right here. You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day!
UNK: No, no, no, it's not a girl. lt's...
UNK: ...a brand-new Huggsy!
UNK: Oh! Oh, that's so great! Now Emma has two Huggsies!
UNK: No, no. Oh, no. No, Emma has one Huggsy.
UNK: The new Huggsy.
UNK: The other Huggsy, l don't know, l guess l'll just take him back.
UNK: You know what? When l was a little girl, l had a little pink pony named Cotton.
UNK: Oh, l loved her so much. l took her everywhere. l would braid her tail--
Joey : Make the transfer!
UNK: Should l be concerned that a button fell off the old Huggsy and l can't find it?
UNK: No, don't worry about it. l swallowed that years ago. Hey!
UNK: Oh, what? l don't think she likes the new Huggsy.
UNK: -But he's the same. -l think she wants the old one back.
