UNK: l tell you, when l actually die, some people are gonna get seriously haunted.
Chandler : There you go. Someone came.
UNK: Okay. Okay. l'm gonna go hide.
Ross : This is so exciting. My first mourner!
Monica : Hi. Glad you could come.
Chandler : -Please come in. -Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?
UNK: -l'm Tom Gordon. l was in your class. -Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.
UNK: Thanks. l'm so sorry about Ross, it's....
UNK: No, at least he died doing what he loved.
Chandler : Watching blimps.
UNK: -Who is it? -You know some guy, Tom Gordon?
UNK: l don't remember him.
Ross : But then again, l touched so many lives.
Monica : So did you know Ross well?
UNK: Actually, l barely knew him. l came because l heard Chandler's news.
UNK: Do you know if he's seeing anyone?
Monica : -Yes, he is. Me. -What? You mean--?
UNK: Can l ask you a personal question? How do you shave your beard so close?
UNK: Okay, Tommy! That's enough mourning for you.
UNK: Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.
Tom : -Hey, listen. Call me. -Okay.
UNK: -l'm dead and no one cares? -l look like a man?
Chandler : Please, one ridiculous problem at a time.
UNK: This isn't ridiculous. Look around, no one's here.
UNK: You gave them one day's notice. Not everyone checks the website every day.
UNK: And Monica, it's probably the way you stand!
UNK: l guess you're right. Still, somebody must have seen it.
UNK: l went to that school for four years and l didn't have an impact on anyone?
UNK: Well, that's not true. You had an impact on me.
UNK: l mean, it's 1 5 years later and we're still best friends.
UNK: Doesn't that count for something?
UNK: Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.
UNK: l'm sure it's somebody for you. Now go hide.
UNK: Hi. l'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Chandler : -Kori? Kori Weston? -Yeah.
Chandler : -You look amazing. -And you are?
Chandler : Chandler. Chandler Bing. And l'm not gay. l'm not gay at all.
Monica : You are married, though.
UNK: Don't listen to him. He's in a really bad mood.
UNK: l can't believe that Ross is gone. lt is just so sad.
UNK: l didn't know Ross and you were so close.
UNK: Oh, we weren't. But we had one class together. He was such a great guy.
Kori : And he talked so passionately about science.
UNK: -l always remembered him. -l'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
UNK: And if heaven has a door...
UNK: ...l'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
UNK: l thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.
UNK: l guess l really missed my chance.
UNK: No, you didn't!
UNK: l'm still alive!
UNK: Who did we bury?
UNK: Kori, l know this is a big surprise for you.
UNK: lt's a long story. But the things you just said really made my day.
UNK: The fact that you're here means more to me...
Ross : ...than if this room were filled with people.
Kori : You sick freak! Who does that?
UNK: l can't believe l had a crush on you.
Ross : Did you hear that?
Ross : Kori Weston had a crush on me!
UNK: No, Mom, l am not dead.
UNK: l know it's not something to kid about.
UNK: lt was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?
UNK: Actually, no. Even if l had died, you would not be left childless.
UNK: Monica?
