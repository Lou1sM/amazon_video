UNK: That people are gonna post condolences on a website?
UNK: This isn't about people not caring.
Chandler : This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
UNK: -You're right. There isn't a decent outlet. -Right.
UNK: l'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial service, tons of people would come.
UNK: Exactly!
UNK: Ross, what are you doing?
UNK: You're having a memorial service for yourself?
Ross : No, that would be stupid. You're having it for me.
UNK: -Ross, don<i>'t press send. Don</i>'t press-- -No, too late. Too late. lt's sent.
UNK: Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.
UNK: That's all right. l'm tan, limber....
UNK: And it looks like l talked my way out of that ticket.
UNK: The surgery was not a success. And then you say :
UNK: ''What are we gonna do, Drake?''
Chandler : Come in.
UNK: l'm trying to put Emma down for a nap. Have you seen Huggsy?
Joey : Original or crappy?
UNK: -Original. -No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.
UNK: Then what's that big lump under your covers?
UNK: -lt's Monica, okay? -That's not Monica!
UNK: All right, fine! lt's original Huggsy!
UNK: l know Emma wants him, but he's mine and l need him.
UNK: She's being unreasonable.
Rachel : Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much!
UNK: Oh, don't cover its ears!
UNK: lt's because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.
UNK: -lt does? -Yeah.
UNK: And l think she really likes him because he smells like you.
UNK: And she-- She loves that.
UNK: Go figure.
UNK: And she's comforted by him because she loves her Uncle Joey so much.
UNK: -Really? She loves me? -Oh, yeah.
Rachel : But you know what? lf you need Huggsy, don't worry.
Rachel : Emma will totally understand. l won't, but whatever.
UNK: Okay, wait a minute, Rach. l mean, if....
UNK: lf Huggsy means that much to Emma, then....
Joey : Well, she can have him.
UNK: Oh, sweet, l knew Uncle Joey would step up.
UNK: -Look, Emma. Look who's back. -No, forget it! Forget it! l can't do it!
UNK: Are you--? You're gonna take Huggsy away from a little child?
UNK: How do you think l got him in the first place?
UNK: And then it just gobbled up that puke. l mean....
UNK: That was one gross pigeon.
UNK: Oh, man. Why didn't l ask Joey to keep us apart?
UNK: You throw a meatball in the hallway, we'd be doing it like rabbits right now.
UNK: All right, you two. l'm gonna go to the bathroom.
UNK: l don't want anything going on while l'm gone.
UNK: Here's a few things you can discuss :
UNK: Mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
UNK: l've missed you so much.
UNK: l won't ask you to get back together. l know we want different things, but....
UNK: -Just to be with you one more night. -l want that too.
UNK: -But is that gonna make it too hard? -lt can't be any harder than this.
UNK: l mean, if l had known the last time l saw you would be the last time, l--
UNK: l would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you moved.
Mike : Everything about you.
UNK: lf l had known the last time l kissed you would be the last time...
UNK: ...l never would have stopped.
Monica : Kiss him, you fool!
UNK: -What? -Didn't you hear that speech?
UNK: lf you don't kiss him, then l will.
UNK: l missed you so much.
UNK: -l knew you'd be here! -Crap.
Phoebe : -Who is this? -My friend Manny.
UNK: l asked him to keep me away from you.
UNK: -Hey, that's what l'm doing for Phoebe. -Well, you're not doing a very good job.
Monica : -Excuse me? -What's with the kissing?
UNK: Hey, at least l knew where my guy was.
Manny : Yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing.
UNK: -You didn't hear the speech. -l've heard the speech.
