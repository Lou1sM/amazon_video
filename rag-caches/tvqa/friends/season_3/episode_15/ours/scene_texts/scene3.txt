UNK: But, hey, somebody's off the phone. How about a glass of wine...
Ross : ...by the fire? I can get it going again.
UNK: Ross, you're not listening to me. I don't have time to stop.
UNK: - Come on, you don't have 10 minutes? - I don't have 10 minutes!
UNK: - Sophie, does she have 10 minutes? - Hey, Ross, I told you I don't!
UNK: Don't yell at me, okay? This is the most I've seen you all week.
Rachel : Look, I cannot do this right now, okay?
UNK: I've got a deadline. Would you just go home. I'll talk to you later.
Ross : - Yeah, but wait... - Goodbye!
UNK: Actually, that's our three-hole punch.
Joey : - Hey. - Hi.
Rachel : Look, about what happened earlier...
Ross : I completely understand. You were stressed.
Rachel : I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.
Ross : For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Rachel : You had no right coming down to my office, Ross.
Rachel : You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work...
Rachel : ...unless maybe they were a park ranger.
Ross : Well, excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.
Ross : Boy, what an ass am I.
Rachel : But I told you I didn't have the time.
Ross : Yeah, well, you never have the time.
UNK: I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Rachel : What do you want from me?
Rachel : You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
UNK: No, but it would be nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.
Ross : - Just a job? - Yes.
UNK: Do you realize this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I care about?
UNK: This is the first time I'm doing something I'm actually good at?
UNK: I mean, if you don't get that...
UNK: I get that. I get that big-time, and I'm happy for you.
UNK: I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine.
UNK: - I don't know what to do anymore. - Well, neither do I!
Ross : Is this about Mark?
Rachel : - Oh, my God! - Okay, it's not.
Rachel : Oh, my God! I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.
UNK: - You're making this too hard. - I'm making this too hard?
Ross : - Okay, what do you want me to do? - I don't know. I don't know. Look...
Rachel : ...maybe we should take a break.
UNK: Okay. Okay, fine. You're right. Let's take a break. Let's cool off. Okay.
UNK: Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
UNK: No.
Rachel : A break from us.
Chloe : And the advances in collating in the past five years...
Chloe : I mean, we just got in an X-5000, you know?
UNK: The X-5000 makes an X-50 look like a T-71.
