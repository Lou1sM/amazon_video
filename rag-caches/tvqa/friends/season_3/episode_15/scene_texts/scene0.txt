UNK: Hey, how much you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
UNK: I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me $2.95.
UNK: Done.
Phoebe : I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
UNK: Why? Do you have a report due?
Phoebe : I have a date with this diplomat I met while giving free massages...
Phoebe : ...outside the U.N. And... I don't know where his country is.
UNK: Okay, let's start with the free massages at the U.N.
UNK: It's my new thing. I figure, bodies at peace make peace.
Monica : You might just get the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.
Monica : So, what country is this guy from?
UNK: There's a G in there.
UNK: - Well, where's that? - In your atlas.
UNK: I don't have an atlas.
Monica : But, wait, I do have a globe. Hold on.
UNK: So what's this guy like?
UNK: Well, he's very...
UNK: ...dashing, you know?
UNK: And very, very sophisticated.
UNK: And he doesn't speak any English...
Phoebe : ...but according to his translator he totally gets me.
UNK: Okay, here you go.
Phoebe : What is this?
UNK: It's a globe.
Monica : And a pencil sharpener.
UNK: People of Earth, surrender.
UNK: Giant alien.
UNK: Five tiny heads.
Chandler : Anybody need anything copied? I'm going to the Xerox place.
Monica : No, thanks.
Chandler : Okay, listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
UNK: If you don't have anything to copy, why go there?
UNK: Are you going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the bellybutton ring again?
Chandler : Yeah. You wanna come?
UNK: Yeah.
Chandler : Come on, Chloe. Finish up with your customer first.
Chandler : Come on, Chloe. Come on, Chloe!
Issac : Can I help you?
UNK: You know what?
UNK: We're having second thoughts about our copying needs...
UNK: ...and we'll need a little more time to think about it.
UNK: Chloe, switch with me. There are some guys here who got a crush on you.
Chandler : Okay, that hurt us.
UNK: Hi, guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
UNK: Well...
Sophie : You know.
Chloe : Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey : Both of us?
UNK: Maybe. Does that scare you?
UNK: Relax. Just Isaac's deejaying at The Philly.
Chloe : - You should come. - We'll be there.
UNK: Great. I'll see you then.
Chandler : All right. Rock on.
UNK: He says that walking with you makes this strange city feel like home.
Phoebe : Me too. Although this city is my home, so...
UNK: So that's dumb, what I said. Don't tell him I said that.
UNK: Just you make something up.
UNK: Nice. Thank you.
Phoebe : This is me, here.
Mischa : Your eyes are very pretty.
Phoebe : Thank you very much.
Rachel : Oh, thank you.
Mischa : He would like to kiss you.
UNK: Okay. You know what, you don't have to do that now.
UNK: No, no, not him! No, you don't.
UNK: The moment's over.
Phoebe : See, there it is, right there.
UNK: Wow, it's small.
Phoebe : Yeah, but Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks...
Phoebe : ...to get all the way across it.
Monica : - So you had fun? - Yeah.
UNK: Except for... You know when you're on a date...
UNK: ...and you're getting along great...
UNK: ...but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way?
UNK: No.
Joey : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: What, is Rach in her room?
UNK: No, she's still at work, but she said to call her.
Ross : What? Is she gonna cancel on me again? How could she do this?
