UNK: Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
UNK: All right, Ross. This is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
UNK: "Call Rachel."
UNK: What's that on the bottom?
UNK: That's my doodle of a ladybug with a top hat.
UNK: She's fancy.
Rachel : - Hello. - Hey, honey.
Joey : - Hi. - Hey, how's it going?
UNK: Well, kind of having an underwear emergency.
UNK: Oh, yeah? What happened? Someone scare you? Make you laugh too hard?
Rachel : There was a disaster in shipping. I have to get this order in.
UNK: Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
UNK: What? Well, how about I come up there?
UNK: No. No. No, honey, please. I've got... I just have too much to deal with.
UNK: Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and...
UNK: Could you be the translator's date...
UNK: ...so that when it's time for our alone time you two can split off?
UNK: You know, he's kind of cute.
UNK: Kind of cute like really kind of cute? Or kind of cute like your friend...
UNK: ...Spackle-Back Larry?
UNK: Hey, don't call him that.
UNK: His name is Spackle-Back Harry.
UNK: You know, maybe we should get going. What time did Chloe say to get there?
UNK: - 10 : 30. - What time is it now?
UNK: 4 : 30.
UNK: Yeah, so we'll hang out.
Joey : Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Chandler : Yes, vividly.
Joey : - She was kidding about that, right? - Yeah, I think so.
UNK: Yeah, I think so.
UNK: God, it'd be weird if that situation presented itself tonight.
Chandler : Yeah, I mean...
Chandler : ...what would we do?
UNK: Dude, I don't know.
Joey : - She was kidding. - Yeah.
Joey : She was...
UNK: You know, just in case, we should come up with ground rules.
Joey : Yeah. For sure. Okay.
UNK: Probably want the first one to be, "Never open your eyes."
UNK: You know? Because you don't want to be doing something...
UNK: ...and then look up, right?
UNK: And see something that you don't want to be seeing.
Sophie : - You know? - Yeah.
Chandler : Good call. Nice. Hold it! Hold it!
UNK: What if my eyes are closed, and...?
Chandler : And my hand is out there...?
Joey : Okay, eyes open at all times.
Joey : How do we decide where we...
UNK: ...you know, each would...
Sophie : ...you know...
UNK: ...be? - Right.
UNK: Right. Well, you know, we could flip for it.
UNK: Yeah, I guess. But, like, what's heads and what's tails?
UNK: Well, if you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
Rachel : No, no, no.
UNK: I am looking at a purchase order right here, and it clearly states that we ordered...
UNK: ...the Riviera bikini in a variety of sizes and colors and...
UNK: What does it matter what I'm wearing?
UNK: Could I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
Joey : - Hi. - Oh, my God!
Rachel : - What are you doing here? - Well, you said you couldn't go out, so...
Sophie : You brought a picnic. What a boyfriend.
UNK: That's it. On Monday, I start wearing makeup.
Rachel : Ross, honey, this is very nice, but I've got a crisis.
UNK: Yeah, but I've got couscous!
UNK: Honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary...
Rachel : ...but I told you on the phone, I don't have time to stop.
UNK: Okay, you don't have to stop. I'm invisible. I'm not here.
UNK: Yeah, but I don't...
Rachel : Who approved that order?
UNK: Well, there is no Mark Robinson in this office.
Rachel : - Get me Mark on the phone! - I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
UNK: Yeah.
Rachel : Let me just check that with what I've got here.
Rachel : All right. See, 038 is not the number for this store. 038 is Atlanta.
UNK: Pepper?
