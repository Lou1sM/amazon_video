UNK: Hey, it's the dinosaur guy!
Chloe : - Hi, Ross! - Hi, Chloe.
UNK: I want you to meet some friends of mine.
UNK: This guy's my hero.
UNK: He comes in with stuff, he wants it blown up 400%.
UNK: We say, "We don't do that." He says, "You gotta."
UNK: And you know what? We did it.
Chloe : And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say, "Let's Ross it!"
UNK: And that's the only color that comes in.
Issac : Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Chandler : What are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
UNK: Yeah, a little change of plans. We're gonna break up instead.
Monica : And I can also speak a little French.
Monica : Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Monica : Why? What did I say?
Mischa : Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Rachel : Oh, my God.
Monica : No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Phoebe : Knock, knock, knock, knock.
Phoebe : Hi. Could you please tell Sergei that I was fascinated...
UNK: ...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in the New York Times.
UNK: You didn't say "Boutros Boutros-Ghali."
UNK: Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
Mischa : He says he was too.
UNK: Interesting.
Mischa : So I was wondering...
Phoebe : Before you get all talky again...
Phoebe : ...could you also please tell Sergei...
Phoebe : ...that I really like his suit.
UNK: He said, "Thank you." He thinks you look pretty tonight.
UNK: "Your hair, golden like the sun." So you're a chef?
UNK: I'm also thinking of opening up my own restaurant.
Phoebe : - Really? - Could I talk to you behind my menu?
Rachel : - What are you doing? - Well, I was having a conversation.
Phoebe : Mischa is so interested in you that Sergei and I...
UNK: ...haven't been able to say two words to each other.
UNK: Do you want me to sit here silently while you three converse?
Phoebe : That would be great. Thank you.
Rachel : - Hello? - Hi. It's Mark.
Mark : - What? Is it my breath? - No.
Rachel : Sorry. I just thought you were somebody else. Hi.
UNK: Hi. Look, I was just gonna leave a message.
UNK: Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?
UNK: Well...
Mark : - Rach? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
Mark : You wanna talk? I can come over.
UNK: No. Really, no. Please. That's okay.
UNK: All right. I'm coming, and I'll bring Chinese food.
UNK: Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry.
UNK: It's for me.
Rachel : Okay, bye.
Joey : - So, what are you gonna do? - What can I do?
UNK: One person wants to break up, you break up.
Chandler : No way. Come on. This is you guys. Call her and work it out.
Ross : Come on. We just had this huge fight. Don't I have to wait a while?
UNK: Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat. Pick up the phone!
UNK: You know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Joey : Yeah. Tell that to my uncle Lenny.
Chandler : Why? What happened to him?
UNK: Nothing. He just really believes in that.
Rachel : And then we got into this big, stupid fight... It was awful.
Rachel : I told him he treats me like a park ranger, something...
Joey : And then...
Rachel : ...I told him I wanted to take a break.
UNK: I don't want to take a break.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: - Egg roll? - No.
Rachel : And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
UNK: Well, he's probably just out.
UNK: Well, thank you, that's very helpful. I'm glad you came over.
UNK: Hi, it's me.
UNK: - Hi. I'm so glad you called. - Really?
UNK: I've been thinking this is crazy. Don't you think we can work on this?
UNK: Hey, what do you wanna drink?
UNK: Who's that?
UNK: Nobody?
Mark : Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Ross : Is that Mark?
Rachel : - Honey, look, he just came over... - Yeah, got it!
