Monica : Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Phoebe : No, no, no. Not a Richard thing. Just put down the glass and get out.
Monica : I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Phoebe : Okay, fine. Use my happy place. Just don't move anything in there.
Monica : I'll try not to.
Phoebe : Okay. All right, so, you're in a meadow...
Phoebe : ...millions of stars in the sky...
UNK: You think breaking up was a mistake?
Phoebe : There are no questions in the happy place.
Phoebe : Okay. Just the warm breeze...
Phoebe : ...and the moonlight flowing through the trees.
UNK: I'll bet he's over me. I'll bet he's fine.
Phoebe : Betting and wagering of any kind are not permitted in the happy place.
UNK: There's just, you know, the lovely waterfalls...
UNK: ...and the trickling fountains...
UNK: ...and the calming sounds of the babbling brook.
Monica : Okay, this isn't working.
Monica : I'm still awake, and now I have to pee.
