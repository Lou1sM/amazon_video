Rachel : I'm not surprised. Have you seen them together?
Rachel : - They're really cute. - "Cute"? This is Janice!
Joey : You remember Janice?
UNK: Yes, I remember. She's annoying. But you know what?
Rachel : She's his girlfriend now. I mean, what can we do?
Joey : There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! "What can we do?"
Joey : All right, who's first, huh? Ross?
UNK: I think Chandler's our friend, and Janice makes him happy.
UNK: So I say we all be adult about it and accept her.
UNK: We'll call that "Plan B," all right?
UNK: Come on, people! We need some inspiration.
Joey : Okay, all right. You want a plan? Here we go :
UNK: So, Ross, you go in through the air duct and disable the alarm, okay?
UNK: Then the rest of us will rappel down ropes.
UNK: We're in and out in 10 minutes and disappear into the night. Huh?
UNK: Honey...
Rachel : ...I was wondering...
Rachel : Do you still have that Navy uniform?
UNK: No, I had to return it to the costume place.
Ross : I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Rachel : You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Rachel : - Well, honey, what about you? - What?
Rachel : Do you have any fun, you know, fantasy-type things?
UNK: No.
Rachel : Come on. You gotta have one.
UNK: Nope.
Rachel : - Ross. You know what? - What?
Rachel : If you tell me, I might do it.
Ross : Did you ever see Return of the Jedi?
Ross : Do you remember the scene...
UNK: ...with Jabba the Hutt?
UNK: He was this really fat worm guy.
UNK: Wow. Men and women really are different.
Phoebe : No. No. No.
UNK: See, Jabba had as his prisoner...
Ross : ...Princess Leia.
Ross : Princess Leia was wearing...
Ross : ...this gold bikini thing.
Ross : It was pretty cool.
UNK: So are you saying that you would like me...
UNK: ...to dress up like Princess Leia...
UNK: ...in a gold bikini?
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : Princess Leia and the gold bikini? Every guy our age loved that.
UNK: Really?
UNK: It's huge! That's the moment when she stopped being a princess...
UNK: ...and she became, like, you know, a woman.
UNK: - Did you ever do the Leia thing? - Oh, yeah.
UNK: Really? That great, huh?
Phoebe : No, it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate.
Janice : See you.
Chandler : - Hey. - Hi, you guys!
Ross : Look who I found standing outside the Szechuan Dragon...
Ross : ...staring at a parking meter.
Rachel : - Why aren't you at work? - Oh, they sent me home.
UNK: Why?
Monica : Because I don't work at the Szechuan Dragon.
UNK: - You really need to get some sleep. - I know I do.
UNK: - Guess what? They published my paper. - Really?
UNK: "Statistical Deviations in the Carbon Dating...
UNK: ...of Fossilized Algae : History or Mystery?"
Phoebe : Rach, look!
Phoebe : Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me?
Phoebe : There he is!
UNK: [scene : - Wheel! - Of!
UNK: Fortune!
