UNK: It's gotta be you, man. I'm wearing smarty-pants.
UNK: Okay, here we go : One, two...
UNK: ...and here's my chance to give you a third one.
UNK: [scene : - Joey? - No, no. I'll just have juice.
Chandler : Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me?
Janice : Oh, I wish.
Janice : You have that report to finish, and I've gotta go see my lawyer.
UNK: I can't believe I date a girl who's getting divorced.
UNK: I'm such a grownup.
UNK: Joey! Hey!
UNK: Go to your room!
UNK: Chandler! Hey!
UNK: Up yours!
Janice : I gotta go, I gotta go.
Janice : Not without a kiss.
Chandler : Maybe I won't kiss you so you'll stay.
Joey : Kiss her. Kiss her!
Janice : I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye, Joey.
UNK: Bye-bye, Janice.
UNK: So when are you dumping her?
Chandler : Nope. Not this time.
UNK: Come on, quit yanking me.
Chandler : I'm not yanking you.
Joey : - This is Janice. - Yeah, I know.
Chandler : She makes me happy.
Joey : Okay. All right.
Joey : You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking...
Joey : ...that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Chandler : I'm not breaking up with her!
Monica : God, look what I found in the drain!
UNK: What?
Monica : It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?

UNK: It's weird, but I don't want to throw this away.
UNK: I mean, this is all I have left of him.
UNK: Gross...
Monica : ...drain hair.
UNK: Cool! It looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
Monica : God, what is wrong with me?
Ross : - You need to get some sleep. - I need to get some Richard.
Rachel : You broke up with him for a reason.
Monica : I know. I know. I'm just so tired of missing him.
UNK: I'm tired of wondering why he hasn't called. Why hasn't he called?
Phoebe : Maybe because you told him not to?
Monica : What are you, the Memory Woman?
UNK: They're not breaking up! Chandler and Janice?
UNK: They're not breaking up! He didn't blink or anything!
