Monica : Dad! What are you doing here?
UNK: Mr. Geller : It's your mother's bridge night, so I came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Since when did you start smoking cigars?
Monica : I don't. I just like the smell of them.
Monica : So, what are you really doing here?
UNK: Mr. Geller : I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.
UNK: Why wouldn't I be okay?
UNK: Mr. Geller : I saw Richard.
UNK: So how you doing?
Monica : I'm fine.
UNK: I'm just a little tired, but I'm okay.
Monica : - How's Richard doing? - You don't wanna know.
Monica : No, I really, really do.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Well, he's doing terrible!
UNK: Really?
UNK: Mr. Geller : Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Monica : - You're not just saying that, are you? - No, the man is a mess!
Monica : - Was he crying? - No.
UNK: Do you think he was waiting till after you left, so he could cry?
UNK: Maybe.
Monica : I think so.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your mom and me.
UNK: Mr. Geller : You know, after we graduated from college, we broke up for a while.
UNK: Mr. Geller : It seems her father, your grandfather...
UNK: Mr. Geller : ...wanted her to travel around Europe like he did.
UNK: Mr. Geller : Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel...
UNK: Mr. Geller : ...because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time.
UNK: However...
Rachel : Okay, here we go.
UNK: I am Jabba's prisoner. And you...
Rachel : ...have a really weird look on your face.
Rachel : What? Honey, what is it? Did I get the hair wrong?
Rachel : Did you just picture it differently? What?
UNK: No, no. It's not you. It's...
UNK: Mrs. Geller : What is it? Come on, sweetie. You're, like, freaking me out here.
Ross : I hate Chandler. The bastard ruined my life!
