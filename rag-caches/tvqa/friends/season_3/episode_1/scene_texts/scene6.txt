UNK: A little birdie told me you wanted to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
UNK: And you got "hate" from that? You're taking a big leap there.
UNK: All right, fine, fine, fine!
UNK: We have got to do something about our little situation here.
UNK: So this is my idea.
UNK: You and me spending some quality time together.
Joey : - But what does that...? - For Chandler!
Joey : Okay. I'm in.
UNK: Okay! This is what we'll call it : Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!
Joey : Does it have to be a whole day?
Janice : Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Chandler : Yeah, I know. I sleep in the next room.
UNK: So do you guys all hate Janice too?
UNK: You hate Janice now? Joey's gonna be so relieved.
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
UNK: Well, look, everybody. It's Weepy :
UNK: "The Mime that Cares Too Much."
UNK: Then I went down to the post office...
Monica : ...and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard...
Monica : ...about the Civil War.
Monica : He loved the Civil War.
Phoebe : Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Monica : Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Ross : Women tell each other everything! Did you know that?
Ross : No, Chandler, everything.
Ross : Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.
Ross : Technique. Stamina. Girth.
UNK: Girth?
Chandler : Why? Why? Why? Why?
Chandler : Why would they do this?
Ross : Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly...
UNK: ...you know, we ought to be doing it.
Ross : Do you wanna?
Chandler : We're not gonna talk about girth, are we?
Phoebe : - Okay. - Yeah?
Chandler : All right, you go first.
Ross : Okay. Okay, I'll go first.
Ross : So the other night...
Ross : ...Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies...
Ross : ...and I happened to describe a particular...
Ross : ...Star Wars thing...
Phoebe : - Princess Leia and the gold bikini. - Yes!
Chandler : I know!
UNK: Well, that was easy.
UNK: - Okay, you go. - Okay.
UNK: You know when you're in bed with a woman...
UNK: ...and fooling around...
Chandler : ...and you get all these mental images in your brain?
Chandler : Like Elle MacPherson or the girl at the Xerox place?
Ross : - With the bellybutton ring? - I know.
UNK: And then all of a sudden, your mom pops into your head.
UNK: And you're like, "Mom, get out of here!"
UNK: But after that, you can't think of anything else.
UNK: And you can't stop what you're doing. So it's kind of like you're...
Chandler : ...you know...
Chandler : ...you know...
Chandler : You don't know!
Chandler : Your mom?
UNK: You're telling me about your mom? What is the matter with you?
Chandler : - You said... - I said "share," not "scare"!
Ross : Go sit over there!
UNK: We're back!
Chandler : What are you guys doing together?
Janice : Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!
