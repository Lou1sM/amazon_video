UNK: ...is that why they're extinct?
Ross : Joey, Homo sapiens are people.
UNK: Hey, I'm not judging.
Rachel : Look, Benny. Spoon!
UNK: Spoon!
UNK: Come on. All right, you know what? I think he's bored.
UNK: Here. You wanna play the airplane game?
Monica : You wanna show Rachel? Come here.
UNK: You wanna do something fun? Okay.
UNK: Who's so brave? You're so brave! Yes, you are.
UNK: - You're so brave. - You're okay.
UNK: He's fine. Let's just put him down.
UNK: Come here, babe. Yes, you're such a good boy.
Rachel : How could you do that to him? Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?
UNK: Nothing, because we're not telling him.
UNK: - We're not? - No.
Rachel : All right, I like that.
UNK: So we're okay. We're okay, aren't we?
UNK: No, we're not okay. There's a bump.
UNK: What bump?
Monica : Oh, my God! Well, push it in! Push it in!
Rachel : I cannot push it in!
UNK: Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
UNK: - That's it. - Okay.
Monica : - I got it! - Okay.
UNK: The second Ross walks in...
UNK: ...take him to your bedroom, and do whatever it is you do...
Monica : ...that makes him go...
UNK: Or...
Rachel : ...we could put a hat on his head.
UNK: A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
UNK: I'll get Rainy Day Bear!
UNK: Because he'll know what to do?
Monica : Oh, my God. You're a genius!
UNK: It's kind of sewn on.
Monica : - Give it. Give it. - Okay.
UNK: It's just like a bloodbath in here today!
UNK: Hey, hold on a second. Hold on a second.
Chandler : Do you think these pearls are nice?
UNK: I'd prefer a mountain bike.
UNK: Janice's birthday is coming up. I wanna get her something special.
Chandler : - Come in here with me. - Wait!
UNK: You wanna get her something special? Get her flowers.
Joey : Get her candy. Get her gum. Girls love gum.
UNK: That's a good idea. "Dear Janice : Have a Hubba Bubba birthday."
Chandler : I would like to get her something serious.
Joey : You want something serious.
UNK: You know what you should do? You should get her one of those...
Joey : ...barium enemas.
Joey : Those are dead serious.
UNK: And you know she'll never get one for herself.
UNK: Look, I'm gonna go in here. And you don't buy me anything, ever!
