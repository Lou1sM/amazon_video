Joey : I wish I was.
UNK: I'm sorry.
Joey : Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now.
UNK: It makes more sense as an ensemble. Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
UNK: Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Rachel : I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
UNK: We'll see about that. Can I use your phone to call everyone I know?
Monica : Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.
UNK: Hey, you're not dead! Okay, see you.
UNK: Monica.
Monica : Oh, my God! He just said my name!
Monica : - Did you hear that? - Yeah.
Ben : Monica bang!
Rachel : Okay, I heard that.
UNK: Did he just say, "Monica bang"?
Monica : Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Ben : Monica bang!
UNK: Sweetie, you need to stop saying that now.
UNK: It's no big deal. It's not even worth mentioning.
Monica : You see? We all do it all the time.
Monica : See? Watch this.
Ben : Monica bang! Everybody bang!
Monica : Ben bang!
Monica : Rachel bang!
Monica : Bang, Rachel! Bang!
UNK: - Isn't it fun? - Look at that!
Monica : We all do it!
UNK: - Okay, I'm stopping now. - Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah. You know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
UNK: How's my Bing-a-ling?
UNK: I don't know.
Chandler : You tell me.
UNK: Anything you want to tell me?
Chandler : Because if you... You should...
Chandler : You would tell me.
UNK: Why are your eyes so wide?
Chandler : You tell me.
UNK: Maybe it's because I was just fooling around with my ex.
UNK: Oh, no. That was you!
Monica : Oh, my God!
Chandler : - All right! - How did you know?
Chandler : Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.
Janice : In the park?
Chandler : No. In his office. How many kisses were there?
Janice : - Just those two! - Why? Why? Why?
Chandler : Why was there kissing? There should be no kissing!
UNK: I'm sorry, honey. I'm so, so...
UNK: I'm so, so sorry. I just...
Janice : What happened was I... I can't breathe.
Janice : Can you get me a bag or something?
UNK: Here. Here. Here.
UNK: - It's the receipt. - I'll take it.
UNK: Look, I've got to know.
Chandler : Are you finished with me?
Chandler : Are you finished with him?
Chandler : Do you still love him?
Chandler : Do you still love me?
Chandler : All right, look...
UNK: ...I'm gonna need an actual answer here, okay?
Chandler : So which is it?
Chandler : Him or me?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: Okay, if you're alive, you answer your phone!
