Rachel : Here you go, Pheebs.
Rachel : Who else wants one of my special home-baked brownies?
Chandler : - I will have one. - I do.
UNK: - That's okay. - I'm not having one.
UNK: No, no. It's just my tooth.
Chandler : - All right. - I'll have one.
UNK: So you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
Phoebe : Thanks. I have a good one too. I just can't see him.
Chandler : See, that is the problem with invisible dentists.
UNK: It's very unsettling to see all those metal tools just flying around.
UNK: Why can't you go to him?
Phoebe : Because every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Chandler : That is so weird. Every time I go to the dentist...
UNK: ...I look down the hygienist's blouse.
Rachel : Phoebe, what...?
UNK: What?
UNK: First, it was my Aunt Mary.
UNK: And then there was John, my mailman.
UNK: And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.
Rachel : And all these people actually died?
Phoebe : Yes. While I was in the chair.
UNK: That's why I take such good care of my teeth.
UNK: It's not about oral hygiene. I floss to save lives.
UNK: Come on, you didn't kill anybody.
Ross : These people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
UNK: It's just a coincidence.
Phoebe : Tell that to them. Oh, you can't! They're dead!
Ross : Thanks, Gunther.
Ross : Can I get a napkin too?
UNK: Like you don't already have everything.
UNK: You're in pain. Would you just go to the dentist. Just go.
UNK: Fine. But if you're my next victim...
UNK: ...don't come back as a poltergeist who sucks me into the TV set.
Rachel : I promise.
UNK: Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
UNK: Hey, is Chandler here?
UNK: No. No, he's not.
Monica : You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
UNK: What?
Joey : What are you gonna do? How are you gonna tell Chandler?
Joey : I was thinking about that. I think the best way would be...
Joey : ...to not.
UNK: You can't keep this to yourself. If you know, you have to tell him.
UNK: It'll kill him. It'll just kill him.
UNK: Wait until I go to the dentist. Maybe I'll kill him.
UNK: Ugly Naked Guy's using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.
UNK: I'm going to the dentist. So listen...
UNK: ...just be on the lookout for anything that you could fall into...
Phoebe : ...or that can fall on you...
UNK: ...or...
UNK: Or just look out!
UNK: And I also just want to...
UNK: I just want to tell you all that...
Ross : Okay. I have a problem. I have to go into work for a few hours.
Ross : Some kids messed up the Homo sapien display.
Joey : What did they do?
Ross : They painted over the word "sapien," for one thing.
Ross : Then they rearranged the figures. Let's just leave it at that.
Monica : Do you want me to watch Ben for you?
UNK: That's what I was gonna ask. Thank you.
Rachel : Wait, hello! What about me?
Ross : You? You want to watch Ben.
UNK: That would be great! I just asked Monica...
Ross : ...because I know how empty her life is.
UNK: I got a science question.
Joey : If the Homo sapiens were, in fact, "homo" sapiens...
