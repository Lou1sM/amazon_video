UNK: Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream before dinner...
UNK: ...if you won't tell him about our little bonking incident.
UNK: Number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery.
Rachel : And number two, I...
Ross : - What? - You said, "number two."
UNK: I also said, "number one."
Ross : I know.
Ross : - Hey, everyone. - Hi!
UNK: How's my little boy?
UNK: He's perfect. Aren't you, Ben?
UNK: - He's never been better. - What did you do, take him whaling?
UNK: Monica.
Ross : Oh, my God! He just said your name! That's great! Good job, Ben!
Ben : Monica bang!
UNK: That's right. That's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
Phoebe : The curse is broken! I called everybody I know...
Phoebe : ...and everyone is alive!
Joey : Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
UNK: My God, I killed another one!
UNK: The curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
UNK: Maybe he's just taking a nap.
UNK: I'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.
Monica : We should call somebody.
Ross : And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at isn't moving?
UNK: We've got to find out if he's alive.
Monica : How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Joey : Well, there is one way.
UNK: His window's open. I say...
Joey : ...we poke him.
UNK: You know how we save all those chopsticks...
Joey : ...for no reason when we get Chinese food?
Joey : Well, now we got a reason.
UNK: What?
UNK: We're fashioning a very long poking device.
Chandler : All right.
UNK: Hey, what's the matter?
Chandler : I talked to Janice.
Monica : Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?
UNK: She doesn't know.
Chandler : Says she loves us both.
Chandler : I woke up this morning, I was in love.
Chandler : I was happy!
Chandler : It serves me right for buying that 12-pack of condoms.
UNK: And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the receipt!
Joey : What are you gonna do?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: You know? What would you do?
UNK: - It doesn't matter what I'd do. - Come on. Come on. Tell me.
UNK: All right, you're...
UNK: You're probably not gonna want to hear this...
UNK: ...but if it was me, and this is just me...
Joey : ...I would bow out. - What?
Chandler : What are you talking about?
Joey : They have a kid together, you know?
UNK: They're, like, a family.
UNK: And if, I don't know...
UNK: ...if there's a chance they can make that work...
UNK: ...I know I wouldn't wanna be the guy who stood in the way.
Monica : You okay?
UNK: You...
UNK: You wanna come poke a nude guy?
UNK: Well, he's finally asleep.
UNK: About that bump on his head...
UNK: Are you sure it's a new bump?
UNK: No offense, but I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.
UNK: It's okay if he bumps his head. Kids bump their heads all the time.
Ross : It was your first time babysitting. You did the best you could.
Rachel : - I did! - I know.
