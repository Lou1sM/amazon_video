Monica : No, why?
UNK: I was just playing with him, and we were doing the "Alphabet Song"...
UNK: ...which he used to be good at. Suddenly, he's leaving out E and F.
UNK: It's like they just, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Joey : - Really? - And also, he's walking...
Ross : ...kind of funny.
UNK: It's like his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg.
UNK: Yeah, he's in there, just...
Monica : Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!
UNK: I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Monica : You jerk!
Monica : - You know how much I love that kid! - Monica bang! Monica bang!
UNK: I'll get the hat.
UNK: I have something to tell you.
Chandler : And I want you to let me get through it...
UNK: ...because...
UNK: ...it's not gonna be easy. - Okay.
Chandler : I think you should go back with Gary.
UNK: I don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.
UNK: You know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Chandler : Whenever I would see him, I would always think :
UNK: "You're the reason. You are why they're not together."
Chandler : And I hated that guy.
UNK: And it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.
UNK: It's the right thing to do.
Janice : You're right.
Rachel : Oh, God. But before I can say goodbye...
UNK: ...there's something I really need you to know.
Janice : The way I feel about you...
UNK: ...it's like I finally understand...
UNK: ...what Lionel Richie's been singing about.
Rachel : You know? I mean, what we have...
UNK: ...it's like movie love.
UNK: You're my soul mate.
UNK: I can't believe we're not gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
UNK: Then don't leave me.
UNK: What?
Chandler : Forget what I said. I was babbling. Pick me!
UNK: No, you were right! I gotta give my marriage another chance.
UNK: No, you don't!
Chandler : I say, you have to give your divorce another chance!
UNK: Sweetie, you should not have to settle for just half my heart.
UNK: I'll settle for half your heart. I'll settle for a quarter.
UNK: I'll settle for a little, tiny... A ventricle.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: - Don't go. - No, I gotta go.
UNK: No.
Chandler : No! No, no.
Janice : Honey. Honey.
Janice : - People are looking. - I don't care.
UNK: I don't care!
UNK: Yeah, okay. I'm...
UNK: I'm leaving now.
UNK: You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Janice : Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
UNK: Rachel has those in burgundy.
Joey : Remember, something this big and long will be very difficult to maneuver.
Joey : Fortunately, I have experience in that area.
UNK: What are you, 12 today?
Ross : Can we please focus here? A naked man's life hangs in the balance.
UNK: I'm telling you, he's dead.
Phoebe : What we're about to have here is a dead, fat guy on a stick!
Joey : All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.
UNK: Steady.
UNK: Steady.
Joey : Okay, a little higher.
Joey : Careful of the angle.
Rachel : Okay, okay. We're approaching the window.
Joey : Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
UNK: He's alive! He's alive!
UNK: And yet we're still poking him.
Joey : Okay, retract the device! Retract the device!
Ross : He does not look happy.
UNK: Now he's showing us his poking device.
UNK: Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
