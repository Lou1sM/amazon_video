UNK: Phoebe Sr : Well, yes. It's kind of an unusual house.
UNK: It has three beautiful bedrooms and no baths.
UNK: But, you know, the ocean is right there.
Phoebe : Knock, knock, knock.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : Hang on a second. Come in, come in.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : So think about it and call me back.
UNK: - Are you Phoebe Abbott? - Yes.
UNK: Surprise, Phoebe Abbott! I'm your best friend's daughter!
UNK: You're Irwin's daughter?
UNK: No. I mean your old best friend.
UNK: Here.
Phoebe : - Lily? From high school? Remember? - Oh, God, Lily.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : Yes. Of course I remember Lily.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : - Then you must be... - Phoebe, Phoebe.
Phoebe : She named me after you, I guess.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : Wow. Well. Look, there's Frank!
UNK: Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes! That's my dad. That's Frank!
UNK: I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : Take it easy. If you want, there's cookies.
UNK: - Or sangria! I could make sangria! - No, no!
Phoebe : Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
UNK: Anyway, I've been looking for my father.
Phoebe : - Have you heard from him or seen him? - No, I'm sorry.
UNK: I guess I lost track of everybody after high school.
Phoebe : Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
UNK: Well, you know, we were always together.
UNK: - The other kids had a nickname for us. - What was it?
UNK: Phoebe Sr : The Three Losers.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : Poor Lily.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : I heard about what happened. That must have been just terrible for you...
UNK: Phoebe Sr : ...losing your mother that way.
Phoebe : Yeah, no, it was great.
UNK: You know what a really good rainy-day game is?
Phoebe : - What? - I mean, naked game.
Joey : - We should totally play strip poker. - No!
Monica : Are you crazy?
Joey : Come on. When you go away, you have to play. It's, like, a law.
UNK: Well, it's not a law.
UNK: As long as it stays attached to that tax reform bill, it never will be!
UNK: - All done. - Thank you.
UNK: Okay. Who's next?
UNK: No!
Ross : No way!
UNK: Come on, please. I'm bored. You let me do it once before.
UNK: Well, if that's the rule this weekend...
Ross : - Get away. - Take it like a man. Come on!
Chandler : Big bullies!
Phoebe : - How are we doing? - Bored and bored.
UNK: You know what naked card game's never boring?
UNK: No!
UNK: So, what's Phoebe like?
UNK: I'm kind, caring and sweet. What's Monica like?
Monica : No, the other Phoebe. The one you went to see?
Phoebe : I think she knows where my dad is!
Rachel : - Cool! - Well, where is he?
UNK: She was pretending she hasn't heard from him in years...
Phoebe : ...but I found this picture on her fridge.
UNK: Isn't this what he would look like now?
