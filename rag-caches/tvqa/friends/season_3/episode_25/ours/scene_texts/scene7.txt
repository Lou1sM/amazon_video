Phoebe : My ass!
UNK: No! It's me! It's me!
UNK: - I didn't wanna make any noise! - Then don't break in!
UNK: - I'm sorry! - What are you doing here?
UNK: I came to fill your ice-cube tray.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : Okay, look.
Phoebe : I took this picture from your fridge. I know that this is my father.
Phoebe : This is Frank Buffay, and you were standing next to him!
Phoebe : Now, look, I deserve to know where I came from.
Phoebe : All right? So if you can help me find my father, then you should.
UNK: Otherwise, you're just mean.
Phoebe : So just tell me the truth.
Bonnie : All right.
UNK: The man in that picture is Chuck Mangione.
UNK: My father is Chuck Mangione?
All : No, no! That's just Chuck Mangione.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : I sold him a house last year.
UNK: And I'm very sorry, but I really don't know where your father is.
UNK: And that's the truth.
UNK: But you're right.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : I think that a person should know where they come from.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : Which is why I...
UNK: I'm your mother.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just...
UNK: Phoebe Sr : ...felt all floopy, and...
Joey : You guys are totally getting back together.
UNK: That's not true. She doesn't even know what she wants.
UNK: Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
Chandler : Then you gotta back away. You don't need that kind of hurt.
UNK: Take it from a guy who's...
UNK: ...never had a long-term relationship.
UNK: I know, but I really want to go up there and finish that kiss.
UNK: The water is great. You should go in.
Chandler : No, thanks. I just had an M&M.
UNK: Okay. Well, good night.
Rachel : Good night.
UNK: - Don't be too long. - Okey-dokey.
Chandler : There is not one hair on that head.
UNK: It'll grow back, right? And she's really fun, and she's cool.
UNK: And I'm finally moving on.
Ross : Getting over Rachel was so...
UNK: I'm finally feeling sane. And if I go up there...
Ross : ...and I kiss her...
UNK: God, I want to kiss her!
UNK: And it doesn't work out, do I wanna put myself through that again?
Joey : Let me get this straight.
UNK: If you go with Bonnie, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
UNK: Right? And if you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Chandler : Hi there.
UNK: That's that weird voice again.
UNK: Okay. Let me try it again.
UNK: You're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear! Okay, come on.
UNK: I can only do it with the voice now.
Phoebe : Okay, okay. Close the door!
UNK: Hi, I'm Dorf!
UNK: Your date for the evening.
Chandler : Dorf on dating? That's good stuff!
