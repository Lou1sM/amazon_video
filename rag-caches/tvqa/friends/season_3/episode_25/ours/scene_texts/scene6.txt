UNK: - I know I've asked you this before. - A hundred times before!
UNK: - How am I not right for you? - I don't know.
UNK: I like guys like Richard.
UNK: Or Pete, before he went insane.
UNK: I don't know. Just somebody more mature.
UNK: So I'm not mature enough for you?
UNK: Monica needs somebody more mature.
UNK: What's the matter?
UNK: She canceled. My namesake canceled on me.
UNK: She claims she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me.
UNK: She doesn't want to tell me where my father is. She knows but won't tell me!
Rachel : Pheebs, that sucks.
UNK: Well, don't "Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.
UNK: - Where are you going? - She's out of town.
UNK: There's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my father is.
Ross : Some people call that "breaking and entering."
Phoebe : - Well, are any of those people here? - No.
Phoebe : Okay. Look, I'll do something nice, okay?
UNK: I'll fill her ice trays. Good?
Bonnie : Hey, everybody!
UNK: Look what you did!
Bonnie : - You wanna touch it? - No, but it's great.
Bonnie : Come on, touch it.
Ross : You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Ross : I was having a little chat with Bonnie, and guess what?
UNK: She happened to bring up who was behind the whole head-shaving idea.
Ross : And now, who was it? That's right. It was you!
Rachel : That was her idea.
Rachel : I just gave her a nudge.
Ross : She said you gave her the razor.
Bonnie : So anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?
UNK: - No, I'm good. - No, thanks.
UNK: - Okay, I'll see you in a bit. - Okay, have fun.
Rachel : Come on, see? She doesn't look that bad.
Ross : You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head!
Ross : - What the hell were you thinking? - I don't know.
UNK: You don't know? You balded my girlfriend!
Bonnie : All right.
UNK: Do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
UNK: You're the one who ended it! Remember?
Rachel : Because I was mad at you! Not because I stopped loving you!
Ross : - You still love me? - No.
Ross : You still love me.
Rachel : Yeah, so? You love me.
Ross : What does this mean?
UNK: I mean, do you want to get back together?
UNK: No! Maybe!
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: I still can't forgive you for what you did.
UNK: I can't. But sometimes when I'm with you, I just feel so...
UNK: What?
UNK: I just feel...
Rachel : - I just... - What?
Rachel : I feel...
UNK: No! I don't care!
UNK: I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Joey : But I made cards!
Rachel : Good night.
UNK: I'm going upstairs.
Rachel : - Good night. - Good night.
Joey : Wanna play strip poker for practice?
