UNK: Joey will be right down. He's looking for his mask.
UNK: - A swim mask? - No, his gorilla mask.
UNK: He wears it in the ocean to scare off the fish.
Monica : Would you look at them?
UNK: I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.
UNK: I'm gonna die an old maid.
UNK: You're not gonna die an old maid.
Chandler : Maybe an old spinster cook.
Monica : - Thanks. - Besides, worse comes to worse...
UNK: ...I'll be your boyfriend.
Monica : Yeah, right.
Chandler : Why is that so funny?
Monica : You made a joke, right?
Monica : So I laughed.
UNK: A little too hard.
Chandler : What am I, not boyfriend material?
UNK: No. You're Chandler.
UNK: You know. Chandler!
UNK: Okay, so we've established my name and hit me.
UNK: But theoretically, say we weren't friends. Say it's a blind date.
UNK: I show up at your door, and I'm, like, "Hey, nice to meet you."
UNK: I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
UNK: Hey. Good! You bought food.
UNK: No, just my luggage.
Phoebe : I am having the best karma this week.
Phoebe : First, I find this woman who knew my parents...
Phoebe : ...then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
UNK: What about that bike messenger you hit?
UNK: I wasn't talking about his karma.
Joey : Hey, check out the hat!
UNK: Wait a minute, I know that hat.
Chandler : I was taken aboard that hat.
Chandler : They did experiments on me. I can't have children!
Monica : Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Rachel : Ross gave it to me.
Ross : - I think she looks good. - Thank you.
UNK: Did he buy it for you...
UNK: ...or win it for you?
Rachel : Excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends...
UNK: ...I'm here to tell you that hats are back.
UNK: And this time, they've ganged up and formed one giant superhat.
Ross : Go, go, go!
Rachel : Now everybody wants to be under the hat!
UNK: What's with all this sand?
Phoebe : Bob said there might be flood damage.
Ross : Either that, or he has a really big cat.
UNK: You know what this reminds me of?
UNK: Why couldn't I be your boyfriend?
UNK: Are you still on that?
UNK: - Would you let it go already? - Thank you, Joey.
UNK: But you'd go out with me, right?
UNK: No. It's the same as with Chandler. We're friends.
UNK: Let's say that we were the last two guys on the planet...
UNK: ...and you had a gun to your head. Which one would you pick?
UNK: Which one of you has the gun to my head?
