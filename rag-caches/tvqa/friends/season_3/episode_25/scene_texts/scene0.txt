UNK: So your first sexual experience was with a woman?
Bonnie : I was 15. It was my best friend, Ruth.
Bonnie : And we got drunk on that hard cider.
Bonnie : And then suddenly, we were making out.
Chandler : Tell it again.
UNK: Seriously.
Rachel : Is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
UNK: Yeah, sure. Earlier she was talking about geography.
Monica : She was listing the countries she's done it in.
Joey : I think we all learned something.
Phoebe : Hey, you guys. Look what I found! Look at this.
UNK: That's my mom's writing. Look.
UNK: "Me and Frank and Phoebe, graduation, 1965."
UNK: - Do you know what that means? - That you're actually 50?
UNK: That's not me, Phoebe. That's her pal Phoebe.
UNK: According to her high-school yearbook, they were BFF.
Phoebe : - Best Friends Forever. - That's great!
UNK: I know! She probably has all kinds of stories about my parents.
Phoebe : And she might even know where my dad is.
Phoebe : I looked her up. She lives by the beach.
Phoebe : Maybe this weekend we can go to the beach.
All : Yeah, we can!
UNK: - Shoot, I can't go. I have to work. - That's too bad.
Rachel : Big fat bummer.
UNK: So, great! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Joey : Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
