Monica : - Totally familiar. - Oh, yeah!
Monica : Why would she lie to you?
UNK: We're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured she'll tell me then.
Phoebe : Maybe she just wanted to give him time...
Phoebe : ...to buy me presents. I don't know.
UNK: - So you're all bored? - Yes.
UNK: I'll close my eyes and point to someone.
UNK: Whoever I point to has to come up with something fun, and we have to do it.
UNK: Okay! Fan out! Fan out!
UNK: You know, we could just do this!
Chandler : We all have to play strip poker?
UNK: Why, all of a sudden, do you wanna play strip poker?
UNK: I think because of margaritas three, four and nine.
Monica : Strip Happy Days Game?
UNK: I couldn't find cards, so it was this or Strip Bag-of-old-knitting-stuff.
UNK: Done.
UNK: "Fonzie gives you two thumbs up. Collect two cool points."
UNK: If you get five points, you get to make someone take off one item of clothing.
UNK: It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
Ross : Okay, come on.
Ross : Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes...
Ross : ...for the Prehistoric Forensics department.
UNK: Okay. "Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point.
UNK: Collect three cool points." Yeah!
Ross : Which gives me five.
UNK: And let's see, who is gonna lose their clothes?
Ross : I think I pick our strip poker sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.
UNK: All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
UNK: "Your band is playing at Arnold's. Collect three cool points."
Rachel : Which means I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers.
Joey : Fine. Gang up on me.
Joey : I got you all right where I want you.
UNK: Come on! Take them off!
UNK: Actually, it's kind of cold.
Joey : How about I keep my boxers on and give you a peek at the good stuff?
Bonnie : All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas.
UNK: Phoebe Sr : What are you doing? Trying to get me drunk?
UNK: I'm just making margaritas.
UNK: Think I'll help her out.
Monica : - What is going on here? - What?
UNK: - You're painting his toenails. - Come on!
UNK: - Chasing him around the room. - Please!
UNK: He's totally flirting with you too.
UNK: He is, isn't he?
UNK: I don't know. Maybe it's just being here at the beach together...
UNK: ...I don't know, but it's like something...
Ross : - Hi, Bonnie. - Hi.
Bonnie : My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
Bonnie : What are you guys doing?
UNK: We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.
UNK: Cool! I'll catch up!
UNK: So you still don't think...
UNK: ...I'm boyfriend material?
Chandler : I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
UNK: You didn't even take off your pants.
Chandler : Well, lucky for you.
Phoebe : - What? - I don't know.
Rachel : Well, is everybody else having just the best time?
UNK: Joey's asleep.
