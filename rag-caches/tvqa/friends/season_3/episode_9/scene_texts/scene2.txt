Chandler : - Wow. - Wow what?
UNK: How it just amazes me that you're still pulling stuff like this.
UNK: - Pulling what? It's second down. - Okay, it's second down.
Ross : Take all the second downs you need.
Monica : - I heard that. - Well, I said it loud.
Margha : It is okay if I stay and watch?
UNK: I can't go home just yet.
UNK: My roommate is forshlocking a big American businessman.
UNK: - Just sit right there. - Yeah, why don't you stick around?
Chandler : - Well, that went well. - I think so.
UNK: You know, I was thinking about asking her for her number.
UNK: Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, you know?
UNK: No. I was thinking about for me.
UNK: As part of that whole getting-over-Janice thing you talked about.
Joey : Oh, yeah. That.
UNK: If it means that much, I'll let you have her.
UNK: Thanks.
Chandler : Let me have her?
UNK: What do you mean? If you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?
UNK: I don't like to say it out loud...
Joey : ...but yeah!
UNK: Don't feel bad, man. We all have our strengths.
UNK: - You're better with numbers and stuff. - Math? You're giving me math?
UNK: All right, you know what? Forget about it.
Chandler : You go for the girl. We'll see who gets her.
Ross : Chandler, I want you to run a post-pattern to the left. And, sweetie...
Rachel : Yeah, I know. Go long.
UNK: You know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
UNK: Well, you wanna just stay out there?
UNK: Can I see that for a second?
Monica : - Okay. - Okay, let's go.
UNK: - I got Chandler! - Hike!
UNK: One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi.
UNK: Fumble!
UNK: What the hell's the matter with you? This is my favorite jersey.
Chandler : Well, now you have two.
Chandler : Hey, I am good at math!
UNK: That's it. I was still gonna let you have her.
Joey : But now forget about it. Prepare to feel bad about yourself.
UNK: Hey, well, I've been preparing for that my entire life!
UNK: Or something about you that's mean!
UNK: All right. Come on, guys. Let's go.
Monica : Tie score. We're running out of time.
UNK: Forty-two, 38, hike!
Joey : I got it!
UNK: Oh, broken boobs!
Joey : - Pheebs, run! - Run, Phoebe, run!
Phoebe : Touchdown! Touchdown!
Ross : Hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
Monica : - After the snap. - Before the snap.
Monica : - After. - Before.
Rachel : - Now, does it really matter? - Yes!
UNK: But I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown.
UNK: Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.
Monica : - Does so count. - Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: You know what? That's fine. Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
UNK: - Oh, okay. - Dead leg!
UNK: Okay, fine. You want to win by cheating, go ahead, all right.
Ross : Phoebe, the touchdown does count. You win.
UNK: No!
UNK: I'm not going to go through this again.
UNK: I wanna beat you when you can't blame...
UNK: ...it on the broken nose or the buzzer or the fact that you might have mono.
UNK: All right. Let's just call this tie score and it's halftime.
