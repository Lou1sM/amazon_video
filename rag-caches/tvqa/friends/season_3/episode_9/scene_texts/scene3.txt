UNK: First, I don't play with cheaters.
Ross : And second of all, you know I had swollen glands!
UNK: You know what? I think you'll play.
UNK: Oh, really? Why's that?
Monica : Because the winner gets this.
Ross : The Geller Cup!
Chandler : Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?
Chandler : Okay, good.
UNK: Okay, where the hell did you get that?
UNK: When you went to the hospital for your nose...
Monica : ...I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Ross : That cup is mine!
UNK: No, it's not. You want it, you're gonna have to win it.
Rachel : All right. So are we not having dinner at all?
UNK: Hey, could you please set the timer, Margha?
UNK: Okay, Beefy.
UNK: Come on, Phoebe, let's go. Come on, it's time to get serious. Huddle up.
Monica : Joey, keep your head in the game.
UNK: It's hard, you know? His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.
Monica : Look, if I take Chandler out of the running, will you be able to focus?
Joey : - What are you gonna do? - Just make sure he catches the ball.
UNK: - I'll do the rest. - Okay.
UNK: - Come on, you wuss! - Okay, come on.
UNK: - Go, Chan... - I got it!
UNK: Come on! This way!
UNK: Hi!
UNK: Look out!
UNK: Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't see that every day, do you?
UNK: What's with the tackling?
UNK: What?
Monica : I just touched him and he went over.
Ross : Okay. You wanna play rough? We can play rough.
UNK: Let's get ready to rumble!
Phoebe : - Go, go, go! - Get her! Get her!
Phoebe : I love this game!
UNK: Hey, where'd you get that?
Rachel : I went really long.
UNK: Forty-two to 21.
Monica : Like the turkey, Ross is done!
UNK: No surprise. You got to pick first, so you got the better team.
UNK: You're pathetic! Why can't you just accept that we're winning...
UNK: ...because I'm better than you?
Monica : Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!
UNK: You know what? I'll prove it to you.
UNK: I'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I'll still win the game.
UNK: Oh, that's great. There goes my last shred of self-esteem.
Ross : What? The guys against the girls?
UNK: See that's ridiculous, Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
