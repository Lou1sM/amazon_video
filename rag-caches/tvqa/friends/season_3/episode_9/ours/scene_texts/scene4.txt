Monica : Oh, then bring it on!
UNK: Unless, of course, you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
UNK: Fine. Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica. Joey, you're with me.
UNK: I cannot believe you are trading me.
UNK: You are going to lose.
UNK: And you are going to lose.
UNK: And...
UNK: Help me out. I've never done this before.
UNK: That's good. Lose.
UNK: Lose!
UNK: Come on. Let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.
UNK: You're gonna let me play?
Monica : All right, then!
Margha : The game is over? We eat now?
UNK: The game's not over. We're switching teams.
UNK: Yeah. Chandler finds me so intimidating that it's better if we're on the same team.
UNK: All right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
Chandler : Hold on a second, Joe.
Chandler : Where do Dutch people come from?
UNK: Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch come from Pennsylvania.
UNK: And the other Dutch people?
UNK: They come from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Joey : Nice try.
Joey : See the Netherlands is this make-believe place...
Joey : ...where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Phoebe : Oh, my.
Ross : Enough with geography for the insane, okay. Let's play some ball.
UNK: - No. I'm not playing with this guy now. - Fine with me.
UNK: Okay, I've had enough of this. Let's just cut to the chase.
Ross : Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
UNK: Chandler And Joey : What are you doing?
UNK: Chandler And Joey : What are you doing?
Margha : Which do I like?
UNK: Yeah, for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill?
UNK: Well, if I had to choose right now...
Margha : ...which, by the way, I find really weird...
Margha : ...I would have to say Chandler.
UNK: Yes!
Joey : Wait a minute. She obviously didn't understand the question.
UNK: Well, why don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her?
UNK: I'm sorry, Joey. That is my truth.
UNK: You hear that? That is her truth, Mr. I'll-Let-You-Have-Her!
Chandler : I win! You suck! I rule all!
Chandler : Mini-wave in celebration of me!
UNK: I am now thinking I would like to change my answer to no one.
UNK: What?
Margha : I now find you shallow...
Margha : ...and a dork.
UNK: Bye-bye.
Joey : Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
UNK: You know what? It doesn't matter, because she picked me. Me!
UNK: Now I get the dates...
UNK: ...and you stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Ross : Save the breakthroughs for therapy. The clock is ticking.
Ross : We have no time and we are losing to girls.
UNK: We're not gonna lose to girls.
UNK: It's 42 to 21!
Joey : This sucks! I was just up by that much!
UNK: Look, let me put it this way.
UNK: If we lose, they will never let us forget it.
UNK: Okay, and worse than that, they'll never let the women you date forget it.
UNK: Hey! Are we playing football, or what? Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!
Monica : We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere.
Monica : Okay, just think about every lousy date you ever had.
UNK: Every guy who kept one eye on the TV while you were making out.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?
UNK: Come on, okay? This is for all womankind. Let's kill them!
UNK: Yeah! Kill them!
UNK: All right, well, I want to kill them too.
UNK: But they're boys.
UNK: You know, how are we gonna beat three boys?
Monica : We still have a minute and a half left, and we're down by two points.
UNK: Two points, ladies.
Monica : Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.
Monica : Rachel, you go long.
UNK: No, don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
UNK: Honey, there's a reason.
