UNK: Oh, come on!
UNK: Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.
UNK: You know, instead of watching football, you could help.
UNK: We know.
UNK: Hey, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Rachel : No, Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles.
Rachel : I want to do this.
Monica : Every year.
UNK: To the ten, to the five. Touchdown, Giants!
UNK: You know, for once I am gonna sit down and try to watch one of these things.
UNK: Halftime.
UNK: Who wants to throw the ball around?
UNK: - Get a little three-on-three going? - That would be so much fun.
Phoebe : - Can I play too? - I've never played football, like, ever.
Joey : Great! You can cover Chandler.
UNK: No, no. I don't really want to play.
Joey : You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
UNK: That's not true. I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.
Chandler : I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say I don't have goals!
Joey : Chandler, you have to start getting over her, all right?
Joey : If you play, you get some fresh air. Maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.
UNK: If you don't play, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won't be even.
Joey : - Come on. - All right, I'll play.
UNK: But I don't like you.
UNK: - Let's do it! Ross? - What?
Rachel : Wanna play football?
UNK: Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Joey : Says who? Your mom?
Chandler : - Yeah. - Yes.
UNK: "What do you mean?" She asks her boyfriend...
UNK: ...really scared to hear the answer.
Monica : Every Thanksgiving, we used to have a touch football game...
UNK: ...called the Geller Bowl.
Chandler : No, no, no. You say that proudly!
Monica : Anyway, Ross and I were always captains.
UNK: It got kind of competitive, and one year, Geller Bowl VI...
UNK: ...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.
UNK: It was so not an accident.
Ross : She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw...
Ross : ...her big fat grandma-arm elbow in my face...
UNK: ...and just kept running.
Monica : To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Ross : You did not win the game. The touchdown didn't count...
Ross : ...because of the spectacularly illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.
Monica : I won the game.
Ross : Oh, yeah? Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Rachel : There was a Geller Cup?
Ross : Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game.
UNK: But our dad said nobody won that game, and he was sick of our fighting.
Ross : So he took the trophy...
Ross : ...threw it in the lake.
Chandler : And was the curse lifted?
UNK: Anyway...
UNK: ...that's why Mom said we were not allowed to play football again.
Monica : You know what? I think we should play a game.
Monica : I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.
Ross : Can I see you for a second?
UNK: - Wuss! - All right, we're gonna play.
UNK: Wait. How are we gonna get there?
Chandler : Because my mom won't let me cross the street.
UNK: Pheebs, here you go.
UNK: - Okay, let's bring it in. - Wait.
Rachel : Honey, throw it to me!
Ross : Here you go.
Rachel : That almost hit me in the face!
Joey : All right, we have to pick captains.
UNK: And then Tennilles.
Phoebe : Okay, so how do we decide that?
UNK: - Well, why don't we just bunny up? - What?
Monica : - Bunny! - Bunny!
Monica : Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains.
UNK: There must be a place in heaven for people who hung out with you in high school.
Monica : Okay. So I bunnied first, which means I get to pick first. Joey.
Joey : - Thank you. - Monica!
UNK: I'm your best friend.
UNK: Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked. Chandler.
Rachel : - Ross! - Phoebe.
Ross : Sweetie, now I pick you.
