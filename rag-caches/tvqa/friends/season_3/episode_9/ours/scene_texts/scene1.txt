UNK: You don't pick me. You're stuck with me!
UNK: Okay. All right. So let's see.
UNK: Let's play from the trash can to the light post, right?
UNK: Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.
Monica : All right, people, listen. I've got exactly 28 minutes...
Monica : ...before I have to baste again.
Chandler : Wow, just like in the pros.
UNK: Come on. Huddle up!
Joey : - All right, huddle up right over here! - Wait for me! Wait for me!
Phoebe : Oh, cool! This is my first huddle.
Monica : - Okay. - Okay.
Phoebe : So what do you guys really think of Chandler?
UNK: - You know what you're doing, right? - Yeah.
UNK: Joey's going to catch it.
UNK: - And you and I are going to block. - What's block?
UNK: - I thought you knew what you were doing. - I thought you meant in life.
UNK: Break!
Chandler : The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Ross : Son of a...!
Joey : - Come on! - Sorry. I'm sorry.
Monica : You know what? We're just gonna throw it.
Joey : I got it!
Phoebe : Go, go, go!
UNK: Score! Seven to nothing!
UNK: Okay, honey, just so that I'm clear on this.
UNK: You said in the huddle that if Joey caught the ball, you'd be the one to stop him.
UNK: Now, you didn't. So is that like a football strategy?
UNK: Yeah, it was part of my plan to fall instantly behind. So...
UNK: Come on. Let's go.
Monica : Losers walk.
Ross : Yeah? Losers talk.
Chandler : No. No. No. Actually, losers rhyme.
UNK: Forty-three.
UNK: Seventy-four.
Chandler : - You wanna go shotgun? - Yeah.
Chandler : - Hike. - One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
Rachel : Over here! Over here!
Rachel : I almost caught that one!
UNK: Great. Now the score's 7 to almost 7.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: On this play, I want you to do a down-and-out to the right, okay?
Ross : - Break! - Wait. What am I gonna do?
UNK: You?
Ross : You go long.
UNK: Well, how long?
Ross : - Until we start to look very small. - Okay.
UNK: Break!
Chandler : - Hike. - One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
Ross : Switch! Switch! Switch!
Joey : Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.
Woman : You are playing American football?
UNK: Yeah. Wow! You're, like, from a whole other country!
UNK: I'm Dutch.
UNK: Hi, I'm Joey.
UNK: I am Margha.
UNK: I'm sorry, Dutch. I didn't get that last little bit.
UNK: Hey, Joey, you wanna play football or... Hi, I'm Chandler.
Margha : Hello, Chandler.
UNK: Her name is Dutch and also Margha.
UNK: Margha.
Woman : - Margha. - Margha.
UNK: Mar-hon.
UNK: Margha.
UNK: Yo, flirty boys. We're in the middle of a game.
UNK: Come on, guys! Let's go! Come on. Second down!
UNK: - Hello? It's third down. - No, it's not. It's second.
