Phoebe : Go, go, go!
UNK: Mon, catch!
UNK: - I'm so sorry. Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay!
UNK: I'm sorry. They were coming at me and I didn't know what to do.
Joey : Thirty seconds left on the timer.
UNK: You are the loser!
Chandler : Okay, okay. So we get to take that stupid troll thing home.
Monica : Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time.
Monica : - Huddle up! - Okay.
Phoebe : Oh, this is our last huddle!
Monica : All right, Phoebe, get open. Rachel...
Ross : ...go long.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Break!
UNK: I did it! Touchdown! We did it!
UNK: You know? Rachel, funny thing, actually. The end zone starts at that pole.
UNK: So you're 5 feet short. So...
Chandler : ...we win!
UNK: The Guys : Yes, yes, yes!
Phoebe : Wait, so explain something to me, though.
Phoebe : If nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going?
UNK: - Let me in, let me in! - No way! Let go!
UNK: Let go?! I'm a tiny little woman!
UNK: Guys, guys, come on. It's Thanksgiving! It's not important who wins or loses.
Chandler : The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me!
Chandler : Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!
UNK: We should definitely play football more often.
UNK: Maybe there's, like, a league we could join or something.
UNK: Isn't there, like, a national football league?
Chandler : Yes. Yes, there is. They play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Rachel : Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.
Phoebe : This stuffing is amazing.
UNK: - Should we should bring them some? - When they're hungry, they'll come in.
Ross : - Let go! - No, you let go!
UNK: How come it's always us left on the field, holding the ball?
UNK: I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
UNK: Hey, it's starting to snow.
UNK: - Give it to me! Let go! - Let it go! Come on!
UNK: There was a time tonight that I started losing the feeling in my toes.
Rachel : - I know. - That's when I realized...
UNK: ...there's more important things than beating you at football.
UNK: Things like feet.
UNK: Yeah, I know. This thing has caused us too much pain and suffering.
Chandler : - Yeah. - It's time.
UNK: We'll just call it a tie.
UNK: - It's a tie. - All right.
UNK: Here.
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : - Good night. - Good night.
UNK: Pheebs, did you get it?
UNK: - Yeah, I got it. - Oh, great.
UNK: Bring it up. There's champagne in my apartment for the winners.
UNK: - Ross! What are you doing down here? - Nothing.
