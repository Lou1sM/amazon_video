UNK: No, it's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Monica : Okay. Sperm donor number 03815, come on down!
Monica : Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.
Monica : And he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
Chandler : You mean there's more than one of us?
Ross : You can't do this, Mon. All right. If you do this, I'm gonna...
Monica : - You're gonna what? - I'm gonna tell Mom.
Rachel : Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
Monica : Why? Why is this crazy?
Monica : - So this isn't the ideal way... - Oh, it's not the ideal...?
Monica : Lips moving. Still talking.
Monica : It may not be ideal, but...
Monica : ...I'm so ready.
Monica : I see the way Ben looks at you.
Monica : It makes me ache, you know?
Joey : Check it out! Jam crackers!
UNK: Okay. All right, how's this?
UNK: Twenty-seven, Italian-American guy.
UNK: He's an actor.
UNK: Born in Queens.
UNK: Wow! Big family. Seven sisters...
UNK: ...and he's the only boy.
UNK: Oh, my God! Under personal comments : "New York Knicks rule."
Joey : Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Monica : Joey, this is you!
Joey : Let me see.
Joey : Oh, right.
Rachel : When did you go to a sperm bank?
UNK: Oh, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.
Joey : Hey, remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Chandler : And that's how you bought it?
UNK: No. That's what I was wearing when I donated.
UNK: I'm kind of surprised there's any of my boys left.
Monica : Honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean, I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Joey : Maybe I should call this place and get them...
Joey : ...to put my Days of our Lives gig on here.
Joey : Juice this puppy up a little.
Monica : - Hey. - Hey!
Ross : How's the maniac?
Phoebe : He's yummy. We did a little kissing.
Rachel : - Phoebe, what are you doing? - Oh, no.
Phoebe : No. No. You know what? He's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Rachel : This guy has been obsessed with your sister for God knows how long, okay.
Rachel : You don't just give up something like that.
UNK: So look, he gave me his night-vision goggles and everything. So...
Ross : You're taking the word of a guy who has night-vision goggles?
Phoebe : What? He's not still following her. You think he's still following her?
Chandler : Pheebs. Wake up and smell the restraining order.
Phoebe : What are you saying I should do?
Monica : I think that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Phoebe : Thank you, Monica.
UNK: Or you could follow him and see where he goes.
Monica : Oh, that's what I would do. Forget mine.
Rachel : Oh, my God! What happened?
Janice : Oh, God. Crazy Chandler. He spun me off the bed.
Rachel : Wow! Spinning. That sounds like fun.
Janice : I wish.
Janice : No. You know, he was just trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.
UNK: Ross' what?
UNK: You know. Like where he hugs you and then kind of rolls you away, and...
UNK: Oh...
UNK: ...my...
UNK: ...God!
UNK: [scene : - Phoebe? - Yes? Yes!
Rachel : What are you doing?
Phoebe : Oh, I was just here looking for my...
Phoebe : Part of an old sandwich. Here it is!
Malcom : Were you following me?
UNK: Perhaps.
Phoebe : Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Phoebe : I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
