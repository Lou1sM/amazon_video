UNK: [scene : - Mon? - Mon?
UNK: "Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller."
Ross : - Wait a minute. Look! - What?
Ross : - Look. Look. Look. - What? What? What?
Ross : It's an empty apartment.
Ross : We're all alone in an empty apartment.
UNK: Oh, honey, come on. I have to be at work in, like, ten minutes.
Rachel : All right. Well, it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
Ross : There it is!
Rachel : Oh, that's what you're talking about.
Monica : - Hey. - Hey.
Chandler : Do I look fat?
UNK: [scene : - No. - No.
Chandler : Okay. I accept that.
Chandler : When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean...
Chandler : ...that I was calling her a cow.
Rachel : Okay. Walk us through it, honey. Walk us through it.
UNK: Okay, well, Janice said, "Hi. Do I look fat today?" And I looked at her...
Ross : Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You looked at her?
Ross : You never look.
UNK: You just answer. It's like a reflex. "Do I look fat?" "No."
UNK: "Is she prettier than I am?" "No."
Ross : - Does size matter? - No!
Ross : And it works both ways.
Chandler : Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
UNK: You know, after about 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.
UNK: Okay. For instance :
Ross : Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options.
UNK: Option number one : She'll take a cab home from the airport.
UNK: Or option two : You can meet her at baggage claim. What do you do?
Chandler : - That's easy. Baggage claim. - Wrong! Now you're single.
Ross : It's actually secret option number three.
Ross : You meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Chandler : Okay, this is good.
Chandler : All right, listen. I have one. Janice likes to cuddle...
Chandler : ...at night, which I'm all for.
UNK: But when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.
Chandler : So how do I tell her that without...
Chandler : ...you know, accidentally calling her fat or something?
Rachel : Oh, honey. I'm sorry. We can't help you there, because we're cuddly sleepers.
UNK: Okay. I'm late for work. All right. Are you guys going to come down?
UNK: - Yeah. I'm right behind you. - Okay. Good luck, Chandler.
Chandler : - Thank you. - Bye, sweetie.
UNK: Bye, honey.
Ross : Okay, the sleeping thing.
Ross : Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
UNK: - I thought you were "cuddly sleepers." - No.
UNK: No. Not cuddly. Not me. Just her.
Ross : I'm like you. I need the room.
Ross : Okay, come here.
Ross : - Okay. You're in bed. - Yeah.
Ross : - I'm gonna use the cushion. - Yeah.
Ross : Okay. You're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling.
Ross : Now, you wait for her to drift off...
Ross : ...and then you hug her...
UNK: ...and roll her over to her side of the bed.
Ross : And then you...
UNK: ...roll away.
Ross : Hug for her.
Ross : Roll for you.
UNK: Okay. The old "hug and roll."
Chandler : - Okay. One question. - Shoot.
Chandler : You're pretending the pillow's a girl, right?
UNK: Remember when you were a kid and your mom would drop you off at the movies...
Joey : ...with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Rachel : You're so pretty.
UNK: [scene : - Hi! - Hey, Phoebe!
UNK: Hey, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
