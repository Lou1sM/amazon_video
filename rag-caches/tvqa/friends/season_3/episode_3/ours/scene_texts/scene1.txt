UNK: No. I had a whole story worked out, but then...
Joey : ...Chandler sold me out.
Chandler : I'm sorry, Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy...
UNK: ...that it just fell out of the socket.
Joey : What is this? Fruit?
Rachel : Monica's making jam.
UNK: Oh, jam? I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Chandler : Because the kids need new shoes.
UNK: I'm going into business. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
Monica : I needed a plan. A plan to get over my man.
Monica : What's the opposite of man? Jam!
UNK: Oh, Joey, don't! It's way too hot!
Joey : This'll just be my batch.
Phoebe : That's it. No.
Phoebe : Hey, you, J. Crew guy...
Phoebe : Why have you been following me?
Phoebe : All week long, everywhere I look, there's you.
Guy : You wouldn't return my calls.
Guy : - You sent back my letters. - What?
Guy : One more chance, Ursula. Please.
Phoebe : Oh, well, this is awkward.
UNK: Yeah, because you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.
UNK: Seriously.
Guy : That's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman.
Guy : I am such a dingus!
Phoebe : Oh, you're not a dingus.
UNK: I just want you to know I didn't used to be like this.
UNK: Before I met your sister, I was like this normal guy...
Guy : ...who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Phoebe : I mean, look, it's not your fault, you know.
UNK: I mean, this is just what she does to guys, okay? So just...
Guy : Well, thanks.
UNK: Wait. You know what? I got a little story.
UNK: When I was in junior high, I went through a period where I thought I was a witch.
Phoebe : And there was this guidance counselor who...
UNK: ...said something that I think will help you a lot.
UNK: He said, "Okay, you're not a witch. You're just an average student."
Phoebe : - See what I'm saying? - Not really.
Phoebe : Well, get over it.
UNK: So... I mean, you just, you seem like a really nice guy. You know, and just...
Phoebe : Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?
Guy : You're right. I know you're right. And thanks for being so nice.
UNK: Here.
Phoebe : Thanks a lot.
Phoebe : Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Guy : - Yeah, okay. - Okay.
Phoebe : You don't have to walk behind me anymore.
