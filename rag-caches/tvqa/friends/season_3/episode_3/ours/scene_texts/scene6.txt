UNK: I'm behind the pillar. Which way am I gonna go?
Monica : - Hey. - Hey.
Joey : - Where you going? - To the bank.
Joey : Sperm or regular?
UNK: Sperm.
UNK: - So you're really doing it, huh? - Oh, yeah. I picked a guy. 37135.
Joey : Sounds nice.
UNK: I'd say so. He's got brown hair and green eyes.
UNK: No kidding?
Joey : - What? - I figured you would have picked a blond.
Monica : - Really? Why? - I don't know.
UNK: I always pictured you ending up with a tall, smart, blond guy with a name like...
UNK: ...Hoyt.
UNK: Hoyt?
Joey : It's a name. Yeah.
UNK: I saw you in this, you know, this great house with a big pool.
UNK: Yeah? Is he a swimmer?
Joey : He's got the body for it.
Monica : I like that.
UNK: What?
UNK: You have one of those signs that says :
UNK: "We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool." You know.
Monica : - We do not have one of those signs. - Sure, you do. It was a gift from me.
Joey : Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Monica : - Two girls and a boy? - Yeah!
Monica : And they wear those little water wings, you know...
UNK: ...and they're running around on the deck.
UNK: And then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
UNK: Sure.
Joey : But, hey, you know, this way sounds good too.
UNK: Yeah.
Joey : Oh, Monica.
Joey : Wow! This guy's an astronaut?
UNK: That would have been cool...
Joey : ...for like a day.
UNK: She'll be back at 5.
UNK: Five!
Joey : I called the sperm bank today.
Joey : They haven't sold a single unit of Tribbiani.
Joey : Nobody wants my product.
UNK: I mean, I don't get it, you know.
Phoebe : I mean...
Joey : Maybe if they met me in person.
Rachel : Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Monica : Get it?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Chan, can I talk to you for a second?
Chandler : Sure. What's up?
UNK: Just one additional relationship thought.
UNK: Something you're probably already familiar with.
Ross : Women talk.
