Joey : You talked to him?
Joey : Are you crazy?
Phoebe : Okay. First, I'm not crazy. And second, say it, don't spray it.
UNK: Anyway, his name is Malcolm, and he wasn't following me.
UNK: I mean, he was, but just because he thought I was Ursula.
Phoebe : That's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.
UNK: Because of the restraining order.
UNK: Not feeling better about Malcolm.
UNK: No, no, no. He's not a kook.
UNK: He's just this, like, very passionate, incredibly romantic guy...
UNK: ...that just got, like, a teensy bit carried away, you know.
Phoebe : And we just get along really well, and he is so cute.
Ross : Oh, my God! You've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
UNK: I'm just going to help him. You know. Get de-Ursula-ized.
Phoebe : Like, you know. Like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Joey : I didn't stalk her, I mean...
Phoebe : - I asked for the news, not the weather. - Sorry.
Monica : - Hey, guys. - Hey, Mon.
Monica : Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry currant.
UNK: Joe, I got to ask.
Chandler : The girl from the Xerox place, buck naked...
Chandler : ...or a big tub of jam?
Joey : Put your hands together.
Monica : Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Joey : No more jam?
Rachel : Well, what happened to your jam plan?
UNK: I figured out I'd need to charge 17 bucks a jar just to break even.
Monica : So I've got a new plan now. Babies.
UNK: Well, you're gonna need much bigger jars.
Ross : - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about me having a baby.
Rachel : - Are you serious? - Yeah.
Monica : The great thing about the jam plan was I was taking control of my life.
UNK: So I asked myself, "What is the most important thing to me in the world?"
Monica : And that's when I came up with the baby plan.
UNK: Aren't you forgetting something?
Ross : What is that guy's name? Dad!
Monica : It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanted to spend my life with.
Monica : If I have to wait another 28 years, then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.
Monica : And that's just stupid.
Chandler : That's what's stupid?
Monica : I don't need an actual man. Just a couple of his best swimmers.
UNK: And there are places that you can go to get that stuff.
UNK: Down to the docks again?
Janice : Night-night, Bing-a-ling.
UNK: Night-night...
UNK: ...Janice.
Chandler : Look at all that room on her side!
UNK: You could fit a giant penguin over there.
Chandler : That'd be weird, though.
Chandler : Hug and roll time.
UNK: I'm hugging. I'm hugging.
UNK: You're rolling, and...
Chandler : Yes! Freedom!
Chandler : Except for this arm!
Chandler : I'm stuck. Stuck arm.
UNK: Okay. Time for the old tablecloth trick. One fluid motion.
Chandler : Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.
UNK: And one, two...
UNK: ...three!
Malcom : Here's my binoculars.
Phoebe : Great. You're doing great, you know. Real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
UNK: These are my night-vision goggles.
Malcom : This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park.
UNK: And these are Mad Libs. They're just for fun.
Phoebe : What's this?
UNK: This is the log I kept, recording her every movement.
UNK: You want to hear something from it?
Phoebe : Not even a little bit.
Malcom : It's about you.
Phoebe : Oh. Okay, then.
UNK: "I met Phoebe today.
Malcom : She was really nice to me even though I'm such a loser.
UNK: And when I was walking home, I thought about her a lot.
UNK: It was weird, but kind of cool."
UNK: Good.
Phoebe : So, what were you thinking?
Malcom : I was thinking what it'd be like to kiss you.
Guy : - Really? - No.
Malcom : See, that's just something I said now so that maybe I could kiss you.
Phoebe : Oh, okay.
