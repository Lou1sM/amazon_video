Phoebe : You so would!
Phoebe : You should get that anyway.
UNK: Well, for clubbing.
Monica : It is so weird.
Monica : I know what I said. But this morning...
UNK: ...I was lying in bed, imagining what it would be like to say yes.
UNK: I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed...
UNK: ...and it's not like me to do something like this.
UNK: But it doesn't mean I can't. Right?
UNK: I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.
Rachel : And I know that we want the same things.
Monica : And when I thought about saying yes...
Monica : ...it made me really happy.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Chandler : I know.
Monica : I need more pie.
UNK: Mon, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
UNK: - You didn't break up with that fireman? - No. That was my way of telling you.
Phoebe : Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.
Phoebe : He keeps a journal and he paints.
Phoebe : He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
UNK: He'd prefer watercolors, but he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
UNK: So then, are you gonna dump Jason?
Phoebe : Yeah, because I have to break up with someone.
Phoebe : So Jason is sensitive. But now so is Vince.
Phoebe : Plus, Vince has the body. You know?
UNK: So...
UNK: It's really just about the math.
Phoebe : - Jason? - Come on in.
UNK: You sounded serious on the phone.
Jason : Is anything wrong?
UNK: Guru Saj : You must be Ross.
UNK: [scene : - Hi. - I am Guru Saj.
UNK: Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so...
UNK: Guru Saj : Well, relax. If it makes you feel any better, I've attended...
UNK: ...fine medical schools in Central America.
UNK: Well, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.
UNK: Guru Saj : Come on, have a seat.
UNK: As I suspected, it's a kundus.
UNK: What's a "kundus"?
Ross : I don't know. What's a kundus with you?
UNK: Guru Saj : Please lie down.
UNK: I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.
UNK: I guess it's worth a try.
UNK: Guru Saj : Sure. We should see results...
UNK: Guru Saj : Clearly not the way to go!
All : What? What?
UNK: Guru Saj : We appear to have angered it.
Ross : We? We angered it?
UNK: Guru Saj : I think I see the problem.
UNK: And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.
Pete : - Love. - Oh, God!
UNK: Often these things are nothing more than negative energy...
UNK: ...trying to escape your body.
UNK: Now. This is not gonna come off unless you learn to love it, my friend.
UNK: So let me hear you say, you will love the kundus.
UNK: I love the kundus.
UNK: Guru Saj : There is absolutely no way this is gonna come off...
UNK: Guru Saj : ...unless you start to...
Ross : What was that?
UNK: Well, it's gone.
UNK: - How's that? - Got caught in my watch.
UNK: Lights.
Pete : Romantic lights.
UNK: Nice.
UNK: So there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
