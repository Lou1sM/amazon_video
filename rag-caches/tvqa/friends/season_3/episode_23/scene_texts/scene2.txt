Monica : I guess that's how.
Pete : Monica, how's it going?
UNK: Oh, it's good. It's good.
Monica : Just here, watering the plants.
UNK: Don't forget that ficus there by Rachel.
Rachel : Chandler's on the couch!
Pete : I see him. You guys are the worst hiders, ever.
UNK: [scene : - Hi. - How you doing?
Monica : Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk...
Monica : ...just so I know, is it good news or bad news?
Pete : It's good news. It's definitely good news.
Pete : Hold on a second, I have another call.
Pete : - How's it going? - It's still me.
UNK: No. I've got picture-in-picture here.
Pete : Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later.
Pete : Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
UNK: Okay. So I'll see you soon.
Pete : - Okay. I love you. - I love you.
UNK: We love you too!
Monica : Well, it's good news. It's good news.
Joey : - What do you think the good news is? - Look at this!
UNK: He wrote a check for $50,000 to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design."
Joey : Sorry. What do you think the good news is?
Phoebe : Oh, my!
Rachel : Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!
Ross : You gotta get Mom on the phone! Call Mom! Call Mom!
Monica : And that's Pete's mom.
UNK: You have to make it a theme wedding. And the theme could be :
UNK: "Look how much money we've got!"
UNK: I mean, you could put money in the invitations.
Rachel : You could have, like, little money place settings.
UNK: And you could start with a money salad.
UNK: I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Monica : Would you stop? We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
UNK: We don't know if he'll propose.
Chandler : But this is Pete. He's not like other people.
UNK: On your first date, you went to Rome.
UNK: For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.
UNK: Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.
UNK: Monica's right. We're talking about marriage here.
UNK: She can't just rush into this.
Rachel : What do you know? You married a lesbian!
UNK: You could do worse Monica. He's a really good guy.
UNK: You know what you should do? Don't decide now.
UNK: Wait until you're in the moment and whatever you feel will be the answer.
UNK: Pete gets down on his knee and pulls out that pumpkin-sized diamond ring...
Vince : I gotta go. I have to break up with Vince.
UNK: - You're going with the teacher? - Yeah.
UNK: I like Vince a lot, you know? But Jason is so sensitive.
Phoebe : In the long run, I think sensitive is better than having...
UNK: ...a really, really, really nice body.
Phoebe : Jason. Definitely Jason.
Phoebe : - Wish me luck. - Good luck.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: Sorry. I was imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
UNK: Excuse me. Is Vince here?
Fireman : Oh, sure. Vince!
UNK: Wow. I didn't know you guys actually used those.
UNK: So, what's up?
UNK: Wow. This isn't gonna be easy.
UNK: I don't think we should see each other anymore.
