Vince : Good deal.
UNK: - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.
UNK: It's just that I thought we had something pretty special here.
Vince : I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to.
UNK: There's so much in me I haven't shared with you yet.
Phoebe : My God! I didn't know you were so...
UNK: I'm sorry. I can't talk.
UNK: I'm gonna go write in my journal.
UNK: Wait! Wait! Wait!
UNK: If you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.
UNK: Thank you. But I wanna remove it, I don't want to make it savory.
