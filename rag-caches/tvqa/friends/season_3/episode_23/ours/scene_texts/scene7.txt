UNK: It's the most intense physical competition in the world.
UNK: It's banned in 49 states.
Monica : What are you talking about?
UNK: My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me...
UNK: ...a combination of Jeet Kune Do and Brazilian streetfighting.
UNK: I even had my own octagon training ring designed.
Monica : And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
UNK: Yeah.
Pete : Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.
Pete : I want you close enough to smell the blood.
Joey : What do you think?
Monica : My parents will be so happy.
Phoebe : Crazy underwear Creeping up my butt
Phoebe : Crazy underwear Always in a rut
Phoebe : Crazy underwear
Phoebe : Oh, no. What is he doing here?
Phoebe : All right, just keep playing. Keep playing.
UNK: You'll get through this. You'll be fine.
Phoebe : Okay, thank you.
Phoebe : And as always, no one talk to me after the show.
UNK: Hey. I was just passing by and saw you were playing tonight.
UNK: It's kind of cool, seeing you up there.
UNK: What's going on here? Who's this guy?
UNK: I don't know! He just started kissing me. Get him, Vince!
Joey : - What? - What?
UNK: Okay. I've been dating both of you.
UNK: And it's been really horrible because it's been...
Phoebe : ...a lot of fun for me.
UNK: But I like you both...
UNK: ...and I didn't know how to choose.
UNK: So I'm sorry. I'm just terrible. I'm a terrible person.
UNK: Phoebe, relax. It's okay. I mean...
Vince : We never said this was exclusive.
Jason : Neither did we. So give yourself a break.
Monica : - Really? - Yeah.
UNK: We haven't been going out that long.
UNK: Come on, we haven't even slept together yet.
UNK: You haven't?
Vince : - You have? - Well, this is none of my business.
UNK: I can't believe this! You slept with him?
Phoebe : Well, I made you a candlelight dinner in the park.
UNK: You know, Phoebe. I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
UNK: Well, that could have been really awkward.
UNK: You made him a candlelight dinner in the park?
UNK: Yeah, but I can do that for you. I'm gonna do that for you.
UNK: I can't believe I ever went out with somebody...
Vince : ...who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooded area!
UNK: Everything's gonna be all right.
Chandler : Okay, Dick?
UNK: Guru Saj : Hello. I am Guru Saj.
UNK: He's supposed to be a duck, right? Because otherwise...
UNK: ...this is way out of my league.
UNK: Yeah. He's got a really bad cough, and our vet can't do anything about it.
Joey : Is there something you can do?
UNK: Guru Saj : Let me see. Let me see.
UNK: Guru Saj : Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
