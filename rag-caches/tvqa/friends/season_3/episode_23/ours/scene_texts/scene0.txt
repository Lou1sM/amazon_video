UNK: Wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a baby?
Joey : We could call it Chuck.
Chandler : Or Dick.
Joey : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: Listen, I need a favor.
Ross : I was in the shower, and as I was...
UNK: ...cleansing myself, I felt something.
Chandler : Was it like a sneeze, only better?
UNK: No. I mean, like, a thing on my body.
UNK: - Well, what was it? - Well, I don't know.
UNK: It's kind of in a place that's not...
Ross : It's not visually accessible to me. And I was hoping maybe you guys...
Ross : ...could help me out.
Ross : Come on, you guys! It's no big deal!
Ross : Well, what is it? Is it a mole?
Joey : No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Ross : Is it...? What, a pimple?
Joey : No, it's...
Chandler : ...fancier than a pimple.
UNK: - Ross, just go see a doc... - Guys, what's...?
Chandler : Well, it's definite. Two more weeks of winter.
Joey : Yeah, right.
UNK: And this is the coffeehouse. This is where I play my music.
Vince : - Good deal. - These are my friends.
Phoebe : People? This is Vince. Vince, the people.
Phoebe : Vince is a fireman.
Rachel : Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building?
UNK: Ninety-eight hot saves. Highest on the force.
UNK: If Joey and I play with matches, we could get you up to an even 100.
Vince : Fire safety is not a joke, son.
Chandler : You're right. I know.
Vince : Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.
Vince : - See you Saturday. - Okay.
Rachel : He's cute, Pheebs.
UNK: But you just started dating that teacher.
Phoebe : Oh, Jason? We're seeing each other tonight.
UNK: Well, Pheebs?
Rachel : Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Phoebe : I know, I know. I'm, like, playing the field.
UNK: I'm juggling two guys. I'm sowing my wild oats.
UNK: You know, this kind of, like, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.
UNK: So do they know about each other?
Phoebe : Does a dog's lips move when he reads?
UNK: Okay, no, they don't know.
Rachel : Hey, guys.
Ross : - Well? - How'd it go at the doctor's?
Ross : He said there's definitely nothing to worry about. It's benign.
Ross : - What is it? - He couldn't even tell me.
Ross : He said it was just some sort of skin abnormality.
UNK: - So it's just skin. - Well, no. He said it's skinlike.
UNK: - Okay. So it's not skin. - Well, it's in the skin family.
UNK: The worst thing is, he said, being unable to identify it...
Ross : ...he was reluctant to remove it.
Chandler : You should go to my guy.
Chandler : 'Cause when I went in there with my third nipple...
Chandler : ...he just lopped it right off.
Chandler : So I guess I'm lucky.
Chandler : I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.
Ross : At least they knew what yours was. You know? Yours had a name.
Joey : Maybe they'll name yours after you.
Rachel : You know? They'd call it "The Ross."
Joey : And then people would be, like, "Oh, he's got a Ross."
Ross : Yeah, that'd be cool.
Monica : Pete's breaking up with me.
UNK: What?
Monica : I just checked my messages.
Monica : He said that when he gets back, "We need to talk."
