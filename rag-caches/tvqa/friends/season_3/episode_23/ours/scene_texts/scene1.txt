UNK: [scene : - And? - Well, that's it.
UNK: People never say, "We need to talk," unless it's something bad.
Joey : That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.
Monica : - Really? - Maybe he just cheated on you.
UNK: I won't get rich doing it, but I gotta say, it's cool...
UNK: ...knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.
Phoebe : That is so great.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Jason : - We'd better call the fire department. - No! No!
Ross : - No. No. - Well, we don't need a fireman.
UNK: We need, like, a good mechanic.
Joey : - What? - It's probably just low on coolant.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! Here they come! We gotta get out of here!
Jason : Wait. Why?
Phoebe : If I wanted to see a fireman, I'd date one.
Ross : That's all it is. A third nipple.
UNK: You know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
Ross : You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off.
UNK: Dr. Rhodes : Take your shirt off. Let's see what we're dealing with.
UNK: Dr. Rhodes : What are you doing?
Ross : Just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.
UNK: Dr. Rhodes : Well, that's not a third nipple.
UNK: Dr. Rhodes : First of all, it's on your ass.
Ross : Well, then, what is it?
UNK: Dr. Rhodes : Wait a minute. Hold it.
UNK: - Jansen, come in here. - I'm with Hamilton.
UNK: He's good with weird things. Bring him in too.
UNK: You know what you don't see a lot? Topless tap dancing.
UNK: I really enjoy these little talks we have.
Monica : I gotta go water Pete's plants.
UNK: You know what? If he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water them.
Chandler : If he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should do it...
UNK: ...if you know what I mean.
UNK: Or...
UNK: ...we could go and pee on them.
UNK: I can't take it, you know.
UNK: I'm afraid one of them will catch me with the other.
Phoebe : It's making me crazy!
Rachel : Why don't you break up with one of them?
Joey : What happened to playing the field?
Phoebe : It doesn't feel like playing anymore.
Phoebe : It feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
UNK: So pick one of them.
Monica : Which one do you like more?
UNK: Vince is great, you know? Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.
UNK: He's just so burly, so very burly.
Joey : Okay, good. So there you go. Go with Vince.
Phoebe : Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Chandler : Sensitive is important. Pick him.
Joey : - Yeah. - Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.
Phoebe : Jason is not a sissy.
UNK: No. No. I meant Chandler.
UNK: You know, I have dinner plans.
UNK: Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.
UNK: Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years...
UNK: Dr. Rhodes : ...and I'm stumped.
Monica : Okay, this is the den.
Monica : All right, check this out. Lights!
Monica : All right, less lights! Bad lights!
Monica : Lights, go away!
UNK: See? You just need the right command.
Ross : Yes. And the dimmer switch.
UNK: For a rich guy, that's a small TV.
UNK: That's the videophone.
UNK: But you're not supposed to be here, so don't touch anything!
Chandler : IKEA, this is comfortable.
Rachel : This place is amazing.
UNK: - Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen. - I know.
Phoebe : It's the nicest kitchen.
Phoebe : The refrigerator told me to have a great day.
UNK: Look, a millionaire's checkbook.
Monica : Joey, put that down.
UNK: Oh, my God, that's Pete. Get out!
Monica : How the hell do you answer a videophone?
UNK: Monica?
