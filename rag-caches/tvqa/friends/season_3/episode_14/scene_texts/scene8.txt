Phoebe : Smelly cat, smelly cat
UNK: It's not your fault
UNK: - That's great! - Yeah?
UNK: You know, you could totally sell this.
UNK: It'd be perfect for, like, a kitty-litter campaign.
Phoebe : A jingle?
Leslie : Why not? You'd make a ton of money.
Phoebe : If I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now.
UNK: You gotta get out of that jingle-head.
UNK: You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.
UNK: That's okay.
UNK: I'm gonna play a song now that's really, really sad.
UNK: It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up."
Lecturer : Oversized bracelets, oversized earrings...
Lecturer : ...oversizing of accessories, in general, is very popular now.
Monica : Can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.
Ginger : I hate that.
UNK: I once had a thing of half-and-half. Stole my car.
UNK: So how was your date with Ginger?
UNK: Great.
UNK: It was great. She's...
UNK: She's great. Great looks and personality. Greatness.
UNK: Sounds like she's got the...
Monica : ...whole package.
UNK: So she's got it all, huh?
UNK: She's the real deal?
Chandler : Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Chandler : Oh, God! It freaked me out.
UNK: It shouldn't, but it did.
UNK: I wanna keep seeing her, but it's like :
UNK: "Hey, you know what? Where's your leg?"
UNK: I'm the smallest person in the world, aren't I?
UNK: Morning.
UNK: Actually, he's the smallest person in the world.
UNK: Heard about the leg-burning, huh?
Chandler : It came up.
UNK: Listen, I know it's a long shot, but...
Joey : ...by any chance, did she find that funny?
Ross : So I nodded off a little!
UNK: "Nodded off"? Ross, you were snoring!
UNK: My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Ross : Come on! Forty-five minutes...
Ross : Forty-five minutes, the man talked about strappy-backed dresses.
Rachel : Okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium...
Rachel : ...listening to Professor "Pitstains" say :
UNK: "Remember that thing that died a gazillion years ago?
UNK: Well, here's a little bone we didn't know it had!"
UNK: First of all, it's Professor Pitain.
Ross : And second of all, that little bone proved that...
Ross : ...that particular dinosaur had wings but didn't fly.
UNK: Okay, you know what I just heard?
UNK: A hundred million people went to see a movie about what I do.
Ross : I wonder how many people would go see a movie called Jurassic Parka.
Rachel : Oh, that is so...
UNK: A bunch of out-of-control jackets take over an island!
Rachel : If what I do is so lame...
Rachel : ...then why did you insist on coming with me this morning?
UNK: Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
Ross : I wanted to be with you.
UNK: I don't know, I feel like lately...
UNK: ...you're slipping away from me...
Ross : ...with this new job and all these new people.
UNK: And you've got this whole other life going on.
UNK: I know it's dumb...
UNK: ...but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.
UNK: It's not dumb.
UNK: But maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it.
UNK: You know what I mean?
UNK: I mean, it's like...
UNK: ...I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
UNK: That's a little clearer.
UNK: See, it doesn't mean I don't love you...
Rachel : ...because I do. I love you so much.
Rachel : But my work... It's for me, you know?
UNK: I'm out there on my own, and I'm doing it.
UNK: And it's scary, but I love it because it's mine.
Rachel : But I mean, is that okay?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: You're thinking about my leg.
Chandler : Actually, I forgot. What's the deal with that again?
UNK: Look, it's okay if it bothers you.
