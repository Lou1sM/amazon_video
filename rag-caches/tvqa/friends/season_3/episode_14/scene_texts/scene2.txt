UNK: [scene : - Hi. - Hi, sweetie.
Ross : - Hello. - Hey, Ross.
UNK: - I've got some bad news. - What?
UNK: I can eat, but I have to come back here.
UNK: Come on. You've worked late every night for two weeks.
UNK: - What is it now? - It's my fault. I quit today.
Ross : But work comes first!
UNK: But that's sad about you, though. What happened?
Ross : What happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did you?
UNK: He's leaving for a better job.
UNK: That's great. So I guess this is goodbye then.
UNK: Goodbye.
Mark : Okay, then.
UNK: Well, we're gonna miss you around here.
Mark : Yeah, me too.
UNK: - So see you on Saturday. - Yeah, you bet!
UNK: Now, you know those are a delicacy in India.
Phoebe : That was Leslie calling to see if we can get back together.
UNK: It's like the 20th time today. Yeah, good luck, Leslie.
UNK: She must've hurt you bad.
Phoebe : Well, yeah. You know, we were best friends...
Phoebe : ...ever since we were little. Our moms worked on the barge together.
UNK: You two must've been so cute, running around on a barge.
Phoebe : You never run on a barge!
Joey : Is Chandler around?
UNK: He met some girl at the coffeehouse.
Monica : Ginger something.
UNK: Sure it wasn't something that sounded liked Ginger? Like "Gingeer"?
Monica : No, it was Ginger.
Monica : I remember because when he told me, I said :
Monica : The movie star
UNK: Oh, man! That's the girl I was hiding from.
UNK: When she sees he's my roommate, she'll tell him what I did.
Monica : - What did you do? - Oh, no! I can't...
UNK: I can't tell you. It's the most awful thing I've ever done.
UNK: You're really not making us want to hear it less.
UNK: Don't tell us.
UNK: We'll wait till Chandler gets home. It'll be more fun that way.
Joey : It was, like, four years ago.
Joey : Ginger and I had gone out a few times. Then one weekend...
UNK: ...we went to her Dad's cabin...
Joey : ...just me, her and her annoying little dog, Pepper.
Joey : That night I cooked this really romantic dinner...
Monica : You gave her food poisoning!
Joey : I wish.
Joey : After dinner, me, her and Pepper fell asleep in front of the fire.
Joey : I woke up in the middle of the night and saw the fire was dying out...
Joey : ...so I picked up a log and threw it on.
UNK: Or what I thought was a log.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Joey : I wish.
Joey : Another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger...
UNK: ...is that she kind of has a...
Joey : ...artificial leg.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: You threw it on the fire?
UNK: She must've freaked out.
UNK: Yeah, she must've.
UNK: - You don't know? - Well...
Monica : What did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Leslie : I ran!
UNK: - You ran? - Through the woods, with no socks on.
UNK: That's the best kiss I've had...
