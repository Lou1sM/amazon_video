Rachel : Funny book?
UNK: I'm just thinking about something funny I heard today.
Ross : Mark saying, "I'll see you Saturday."
Rachel : Yeah, at the lecture.
UNK: I told you last week. You said you didn't mind.
UNK: It's not the lecture I mind.
UNK: Please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
Chandler : - Well... - Oh, my God!
UNK: I'm sorry, but if you're not working with him anymore...
UNK: ...why do you still hang out?
UNK: Because he's my friend.
Ross : But do you really need another "friend"?
Rachel : If I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Ross : Is that funny? Am I suppose to be laughing?
UNK: I don't know. You thought "See you Saturday" was funny.
Rachel : Mark is in fashion.
Rachel : I like having a friend I can share this stuff with.
Rachel : You guys would never go to a lecture with me.
Ross : - I'd love to go with you. - Really?
Ross : I have clothes.
Ross : I even pick them out.
Ross : For all you know, I could be a fashion...
UNK: ...monger.
Rachel : I would love for you to go with me.
UNK: What?
Ross : What should I wear? Now I'm all nervous.
