UNK: I only need to know how much it bothers you...
UNK: ...because I don't like wasting my time.
UNK: Am I wasting my time?
UNK: No, I don't think so.
UNK: It's like anything else. You just have to get used to it.
UNK: What's that?
UNK: That's my "nubbin."
UNK: What's a nubbin?
UNK: It's kind of a third-nipple kind of thing.
Ginger : You have three nipples?
UNK: Well, you know, two regulars...
UNK: ...and one that barely qualifies as a...
Chandler : - What? - Nothing. You know, I...
Ginger : I just remembered. I have to leave.
Chandler : You have to leave? Now? How come?
UNK: Well, it's nubbin. Nothing!
UNK: You know what? I'll see you later.
UNK: I thought you weren't coming.
Phoebe : - Where were you? - Come here, come here.
UNK: Don't get mad, okay?
UNK: Don't give me a reason to get mad, okay?
Leslie : I played Smelly Cat for my old ad agency. They went nuts!
UNK: I told you I didn't want you to try and sell it...
UNK: ...and you just big, fat did it anyway!
Phoebe : I think, five years ago, I probably would have done anything...
Phoebe : ...to play with you.
UNK: But I can do it myself. If I can't trust you, then forget it.
UNK: I don't wanna forget it.
UNK: You know what? You have to choose.
Phoebe : If the most important thing on the planet to you...
UNK: ...is this cat-poopy thing, then you can have Smelly Cat.
UNK: But we won't be partners.
UNK: So, what's it gonna be?
Phoebe : - Smelly cat, smelly cat - Problem odor in the litter box?
UNK: Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
UNK: It's not your fault
Monica : - Sorry, Pheebs. - Yeah.
Ginger : You okay?
Phoebe : I actually am.
UNK: Because, you know, life's gonna hand you all kinds of stuff.
Phoebe : You learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow.
UNK: - You wanna hear a new song? - We'd love to.
Phoebe : Jingle bitch screwed me over
Phoebe : Go to hell, jingle whore
Phoebe : Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell
UNK: That's all I have so far.
Chandler : Well, hello!
UNK: - Where you been? - The doctor.
Ross : Is everything okay?
Chandler : Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.
Chandler : Two nipples, no waiting.
UNK: Well! Just like Rachel in high school.
UNK: What?
Monica : Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke.
Chandler : That was an obvious joke.
UNK: And I didn't think of it. Why?
Chandler : The source of all my powers.
Chandler : Oh, dear God, what have I done?
