Ross : - Hey. - Hey.
Joey : What are you doing here?
UNK: Well, I thought a lot about what you said...
UNK: ...and I realize maybe I was a little judgmental.
UNK: Yeah. But...
Joey : Now, Phoebe, remember, hey...
UNK: ...they're just fulfilling their Christmas...
UNK: - Destiny. Yes. - Sure.
UNK: Okay.
Phoebe : Yikes. That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
UNK: That's one of the old ones. He's just taking it to the back.
Phoebe : You keep the old ones in the back?
Phoebe : That is so ageist.
Joey : - We have to make room for the fresh ones. - So, what happens to the old guys?
Joey : Well, they go into the chipper.
Phoebe : Why do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?
