UNK: Okay, 12.
UNK: Twenty-two.
UNK: Eighteen.
UNK: What?
UNK: I spelled out "boobies."
UNK: Ross? Put me down for another box of the Mint Treasures, okay?
Monica : Where are the Mint Treasures?
UNK: We're out. I sold them all.
UNK: What?
UNK: Monica, I'm cutting you off.
UNK: No.
UNK: No.
Monica : Just a couple more boxes.
UNK: It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.
Monica : You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Ross : Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Rachel : Oh, God!
UNK: - So how many you sold so far? - Check this out.
Ross : - Five hundred and seventeen boxes. - Oh, my God. How did you do that?
UNK: Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum...
UNK: ...just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium.
UNK: Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes.
UNK: That's when it occurred to me. The key to my success : The munchies.
UNK: So I started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.
UNK: I am selling cookies by the case.
UNK: They call me "Cookie Dude."
UNK: - Okay, but I'm not going to call you that. - Okay.
UNK: Okay. Stop what you're doing. I need envelope stuffers. I need stamp lickers...
UNK: - Hey, who did these resumes for you? - Me. On my computer.
Ross : You sure used a large font.
UNK: Yeah. Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse"...
UNK: ...and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain" only took up so much room.
UNK: Hey, that's funny!
UNK: You're funny, Chandler! You're a funny guy!
UNK: You know what else is really funny?
Chandler : Something else I might have said?
UNK: I don't know. I don't know. Weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job...
Rachel : ...when I had absolutely nothing else to do?
UNK: - Sweetie, calm down. It's gonna be okay. - No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.
Rachel : Tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead.
UNK: Okay. You know what? I'm just gonna call Gunther...
UNK: ...and tell him I'm not quitting.
UNK: You don't want to give in to The Fear.
Rachel : You and your stupid Fear. I hate your Fear!
Rachel : I would like to take you and your Fear...
Joey : Hey! I got great news.
Chandler : Run, Joey. Run for your life!
UNK: What? Rach, listen. Have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
UNK: No.
UNK: My old man's doing a plumbing job there, and he heard they have an opening.
UNK: Want to see if he can get you an interview?
Rachel : Oh, my God, yes. I would love that. That's so sweet, Joey.
Joey : Not a problem.
Joey : And now for the great news.
UNK: What, that wasn't the great news?
Joey : Only if you think it's better than this.
UNK: Snow-in-a-Can!
Joey : I got it at work. You want me to decorate the window?
UNK: Give it kind of a Christmas looky?
Monica : Christmas cookie?
UNK: Okay, and this one here's a Douglas fir.
UNK: Now, it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
UNK: Looks good. I'll take it.
Phoebe : Wait, wait. No, no. You don't want that one.
Phoebe : No. You can have this cool brown one.
UNK: It's almost dead.
UNK: But that's why you have to buy it, so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.
UNK: Otherwise, they're gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.
UNK: Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill their Christmas destiny...
Joey : ...are thrown in the chipper.
UNK: I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
UNK: Pheebs. You gotta stop doing this. I'm working on commission here.
