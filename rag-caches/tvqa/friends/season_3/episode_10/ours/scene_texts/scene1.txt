UNK: Yes?
UNK: Yeah, hi. I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
UNK: You're no Brown Bird. I can see you through my peephole.
UNK: No. Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.
Woman : What does that mean?
Ross : Well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleepovers.
UNK: I can dial 911 at the press of a button, you know.
Woman : Now, go away!
Ross : Please, please. It's for a poor little girl...
UNK: ...who wants to go to Space Camp more than anything in the world.
UNK: I'm pressing.
Woman : A policeman is on his way.
Ross : Okay, okay. I'm going, I'm going.
Woman : I can still see you!
Ross : All right!
