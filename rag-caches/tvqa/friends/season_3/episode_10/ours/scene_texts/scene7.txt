Ross : Good going.
UNK: Who's next?
Ross : - Hi, there. - Hi.
Leader : And batting for Sarah...
Leader : ...Ross Geller.
UNK: Eight hundred and seventy-two.
Leader : Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Ross : That is because my doctor says that I have...
Ross : ...a very serious...
UNK: ...nougat...
UNK: ...deficiency.
Chandler : Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Ross : Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her 19-year-old sister...
Ross : ...who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz and sold over 2000 boxes.
UNK: - Hey, how'd the interview go? - I blew it.
UNK: I wouldn't have even hired me.
Ross : Come here, sweetie.
UNK: Listen...
UNK: ...you're gonna go on, like, a thousand interviews before you get a job.
UNK: That's not how that was supposed to come out.
UNK: This is just the worst Christmas ever.
UNK: You know what, Rach? Maybe you should stay here at the coffeehouse.
UNK: I can't. It's too late. Terry already hired that girl over there.
Rachel : Look at her.
UNK: She's even got waitress experience.
Rachel : Last night she was...
Rachel : ...teaching everybody how to make...
UNK: ...napkins...
UNK: ...into...
UNK: That word was "swans."
Chandler : Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet himself really perked up my Christmas.
Chandler : Oh, my God!
UNK: Joey And Monica : Merry Christmas!
Phoebe : You saved them! You guys!
UNK: Oh, God, you're the best!
UNK: It's like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
UNK: Hello.
Rachel : Yeah, this is she.
UNK: You're kidding. You're kidding.
Rachel : Thank you. I love you!
Chandler : Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
Rachel : I got the job!
UNK: That's great.
Phoebe : God bless us, everyone.
UNK: Here we go. Serving my last cup of coffee.
Rachel : There you go.
UNK: Enjoy.
Chandler : - Should I tell her I ordered tea? - No.
Rachel : Excuse me, everyone.
Rachel : This is my last night working here...
UNK: ...and I just wanted to say...
Rachel : ...that I made some really good friends here.
UNK: And it's just time to move on.
UNK: And no offense to everybody who still works here...
UNK: ...but you have no idea how good it feels to say...
Rachel : ...that as of this moment...
Rachel : ...I will never have to make coffee again.
UNK: So you're gonna use two bags instead of one.
UNK: I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Space Camp...
UNK: ...and I'm hoping that maybe somehow this may help make up for it. Okay?
UNK: Presenting...
UNK: ...Sarah Tuddle's Private Very Special Space Camp!
Sarah : Really, Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
Ross : Come on, here we go.
Ross : Stand by for mission countdown.
Joey : Ten, ten...
Joey : Nine, nine, nine...
Joey : Eight, eight, eight...
Joey : Okay, blast off.
UNK: I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Ross : Oh, no! An asteroid!
