Ross : - This stuff? - Careful.
Phoebe : - Okay. - Light.
Rachel : Just sweep it across the lid. Just sweep it.
UNK: Sorry!
UNK: That's just poking me in the eye.
UNK: I'm sorry. Close.
Rachel : - Just sweep it. - I'm sweeping.
Ross : Sweep, sweep.
Rachel : Okay, now make it even because we don't...
UNK: What?
UNK: I don't want it to be too much. I want it to be subtle.
UNK: You don't wear enough of this.
Rachel : Since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Ross : Close your eye. You're gonna like this better.
Ross : - Close, close. - Blow it.
UNK: Sorry. Because I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Rachel : Sophisticated like a hooker?
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: - Guess what I'm doing tonight. - What?
UNK: I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Phoebe : Monica, I am so excited for you!
