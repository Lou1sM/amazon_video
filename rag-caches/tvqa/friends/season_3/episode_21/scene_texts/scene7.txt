UNK: Okay, and it's not just chicks. It's all kinds of other animals.
UNK: That's horrible. You did the right thing, man.
UNK: Thanks. I'm glad you see it that way.
Chandler : Funny story!
UNK: I don't believe this!
Monica : Look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic!
Monica : I mean, I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!
Monica : Oh, my God! Look at these spider burners! I love spider burners!
Pete : So you like it?
UNK: It is so perfect! Thank you so much.
UNK: You're welcome.
Monica : Did you just smell my hair?
UNK: No! No way! What? No.
Monica : - Oh, God. - What?
Monica : You still have feelings for me, don't you?
UNK: No, I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
UNK: [scene : - Pete. - Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
UNK: No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all.
UNK: It's really nice.
UNK: The only one who stands to get hurt is me, and I'm okay with that.
UNK: You may be okay with getting hurt...
Monica : ...but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you.
UNK: That's why I can't take this job.
UNK: What?
UNK: We probably shouldn't see each other anymore.
UNK: I'm sorry.
Pete : Okay, yeah.
UNK: I mean, if that's really what you want, okay.
Monica : Okay, bye.
UNK: - I'm sorry things didn't work out... - Shut up for a second...
Monica : ...and let me just see something.
UNK: You'd tell me the truth, right?
UNK: - Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray. - Okay.
Chandler : Okay, now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!
UNK: - That's a duck! - That's a bad duck!
UNK: How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Rachel : What thing? What thing?
UNK: Nothing. There was this thing at the museum. Come on.
UNK: Easy.
Chandler : Now, when you come back, I hope you remember that that chick is not a toy!
Rachel : What thing? What is this thing?
UNK: I was kind of supposed to be on TV tonight for the Discovery Channel.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
UNK: Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
UNK: Because I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go...
Ross : ...and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on.
Rachel : - I cannot believe you. - What?
Rachel : That is the sweetest thing.
Ross : You should get some sleep.
UNK: - So I'll... - Sorry I spoiled your evening.
UNK: No, that's... No, as long as you're okay.
UNK: So I'll see you tomorrow.
UNK: Yeah.
Monica : See you.
Monica : What did you do?
UNK: What you doing?
Chandler : Having a swim.
Joey : What about the chick?
UNK: Chicks don't swim.
Joey : Are you sure?
UNK: I don't know.
Chandler : - Should we try? - Sure.
Chandler : See, I told you. They don't swim.
Joey : - Wait, give him a minute. - No!
UNK: It's okay. It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
