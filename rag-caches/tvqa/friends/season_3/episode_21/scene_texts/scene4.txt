Monica : - What? - I can't tell you.
UNK: Wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me?
Phoebe : Well, sure, in a perfect world.
UNK: But no. I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to all my gods.
Monica : Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
UNK: No.
Monica : - Does it have to do with Joey? - No.
UNK: Does it have to do with Chandler and that sock he keeps by his bed?
UNK: No, but let's come back to that later.
