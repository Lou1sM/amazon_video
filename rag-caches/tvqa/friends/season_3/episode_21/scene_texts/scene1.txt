UNK: Got a job on a riverboat?
UNK: You know what? I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
UNK: You're not my girlfriend anymore, so...
Rachel : I see. So this suit is making a point.
UNK: Now that you're on your own, you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.
Ross : You like it, right?
Monica : Absolutely! I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
UNK: Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.
UNK: - What were you gonna tell us? - Yeah.
UNK: - Was it how you invented the cotton gin? - Okay, goodbye.
UNK: - Was that a little harsh? - Are you kidding?
UNK: Remember when you used to wear that gray sweat suit.
UNK: And I used to call you the Hindenberg.
UNK: No.
UNK: My mistake.
Chandler : So after you put the suggestion in the box...
Chandler : ...how long did it take for the roller skating to happen?
Phoebe : About three months.
UNK: Okay, so I guess that's about two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey.
Joey : I got you something. Open it! Open it!
UNK: Okay.
UNK: It's a chicken.
UNK: It's cute, huh?
Phoebe : You guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Chandler : Fowl? No.
Chandler : Women? No.
Phoebe : They are a huge responsibility.
Phoebe : Especially at this age. They require constant care.
Phoebe : They need just the right food and lots and lots of love.
Joey : Well, no problem there.
Chandler : Easy, Lenny.
Pete : So, I mean, have you thought about it?
UNK: Okay, here's the thing.
UNK: Oh, no. Not "the thing." I hate "the thing."
UNK: What's "the thing"?
UNK: I can't do it.
UNK: I'm sorry. I wish I could...
UNK: ...but you have these feelings for me.
UNK: Wait. That's what you're worried about?
UNK: If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
Pete : I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else on my trip.
UNK: Her name's Ann. She's a journalist. We met on the plane.
UNK: She asked to finish my peanuts.
Pete : I thought she said something else. We had a big laugh.
Pete : Yeah, I just... I mean, I got tired of waiting.
UNK: That's great. I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.
Monica : - And now I can work for you! - I guess you can.
UNK: Oh, my God! This is incredible!
UNK: You know what? I'm gonna roll right into that office and quit!
Gunther : All right!
UNK: - Could you give me a little push? - Yeah, sure.
Pete : - Good luck! - I'm quitting!
UNK: I'm okay! I'm all right!
UNK: That's exciting. You went to Japan, made up a woman.
UNK: What?
UNK: I'm just saying, this woman, I mean, she's fictitious, no?
Pete : - Why would you say that? - You're still into Monica.
UNK: You said there's somebody else, so she'd agree to work with you.
UNK: If you spend a lot of time together, maybe something might happen.
UNK: You're good. You're good.
UNK: No, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic.
UNK: It's a substantial gift.
Pete : Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
UNK: Absolutely. I promise. Tell her what?
Pete : Thanks a lot.
UNK: No, I'm serious. I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Chandler : Okay, but this is the last time.
Chandler : With a chick-chick here And a chick-chick there
Chandler : Here a chick, there a chick Everywhere a chick-chick
UNK: Chicken
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: How's she doing?
UNK: She?
