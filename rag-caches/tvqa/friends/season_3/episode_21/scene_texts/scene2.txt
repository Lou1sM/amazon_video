UNK: Yeah, don't you think it's a she?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: I can't tell. Whatever it was went back in too quickly.
UNK: Anyway, I gotta go change. I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Chandler : Excuse me?
UNK: What?
UNK: I stayed home while you were at rehearsal...
Chandler : ...so somebody could be here with our chick.
UNK: Who was up from 2 : 00 this morning until 5 : 00 this morning...
Joey : ...trying to get her back to sleep?
UNK: You don't think I get up when you get up?
UNK: Oh, here it comes.
Chandler : Yes! Here it comes! I'm stuck here all day!
Chandler : And then you come in and spend two seconds with us.
Chandler : And then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
UNK: Well, I don't think so, mister!
Joey : I need to relax, okay? I was working all day.
UNK: And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
UNK: That's not what I said. I just meant...
Chandler : I know what you meant!
UNK: Have you noticed that ever since we got this chick...
UNK: ...we've been fighting a lot more than we used to?
UNK: I don't know. Maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
UNK: I sure want one someday though.
Rachel : I know. I know.
UNK: I'll take her back tomorrow.
UNK: You think we'll get our $3 back?
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: - I can't believe you still have that. - We're taking her back.
UNK: No, that ridiculous thing on your face.
Rachel : - Thank you. - All right?
Ross : I have that TV thing in, like, two hours, and I need your help, okay?
Ross : What do you think? This blue suit or this brown one?
Joey : The brown one brings out your eyes.
Joey : But your butt looks great in the blue one.
UNK: Really?
Ross : That aspirin dance really works.
Ross : - Oh, my God. Is that still...? - I'm fine. I'm fine.
UNK: - No, you're not! - Yes, I am.
UNK: Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that.
UNK: You've got to go to a doctor, okay?
Rachel : I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my boss's house.
UNK: There's a lot of people there that I have to meet.
UNK: I'm sure you'll make a great impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel Greene.
UNK: It's nice to meet you."
Ross : Come on, you probably have a broken rib.
Rachel : I will go to the hospital tomorrow. It'll still be broken then.
UNK: But you know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Rachel : Look, either help me or go.
UNK: Fine. I'll go.
Rachel : Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
UNK: Sure. I'll help you.
Chandler : Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?
Chandler : You know what? I cannot do this with my left hand.
Rachel : Would you please help me with this too?
UNK: - Okay, let's use this brush. - Okay.
