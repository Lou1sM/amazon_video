Ross : There you go! Good enough for your party?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Sure. I'll just sit next to the transsexual from purchasing.
Ross : Come on! Okay, come on.
Ross : All right, I gotta go, so good luck at the party, okay?
UNK: Oh, wait. Ross, could you just stay and help me get dressed?
Ross : Sure. Okay.
UNK: Okay, great. Okay, just turn around.
UNK: What?
UNK: I don't want you to see me naked.
UNK: Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked.
Ross : I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your bellybutton.
Rachel : Yeah, but that was different. We were going out then.
UNK: Now it's weird.
UNK: Rach, you know, I can see you naked anytime I want.
UNK: What?
Ross : All I have to do is close my eyes. See?
Rachel : - Ross, stop that! - I'm sorry.
UNK: Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that anymore.
Ross : Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.
UNK: It's one of my rights as the ex-boyfriend.
Rachel : Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
UNK: I'm sorry. It will never happen...
UNK: Wait a minute! Wait, wait.
UNK: Now there are 100 of you, and I'm the king!
Chandler : - Ross. - Would you grow up? It's no big deal.
UNK: All right. Fine.
Rachel : See what you did? I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.
UNK: Oh, my God. All right, look, look. Okay. Rach!
Ross : Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital, okay?
UNK: - Okay, I do. I really do. - Okay?
UNK: I'm gonna get your coat, then I'll put you in a cab.
UNK: Wait! You're not gonna come with me?
Ross : Of course I am.
Ross : I just have to make a call.
Phoebe : - Okay - Okay.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: What's wrong?
UNK: I'm sorry. I just can't go to the hospital looking like this.
Monica : - Does it involve travel? - No.
Monica : Does it involve clogs?
Phoebe : Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?
Monica : - Clogs. - No.
Phoebe : - Claws? - No.
UNK: Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.
Monica : - What about Pete? - No.
Monica : What is it?
Monica : - What about Pete? - I don't know!
UNK: Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.
Monica : - Phoebe, would you just tell me? - I can't!
Monica : - Okay, I gotta go. - But you're so close! No!
Monica : Does it involve Pete's computer company?
UNK: Just go! You're never gonna get it!
Rachel : I know.
UNK: See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.
UNK: She's a completely different kind of chick.
Chandler : I love you both.
