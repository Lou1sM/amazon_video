UNK: So let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?
Joey : What are you talking about?
Joey : It was a big deal.
UNK: You can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.
Joey : I was there. You're not that good an actress.
Kate : I was just caught up in the moment.
UNK: That's all it was.
UNK: Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but...
UNK: ...haven't you slept with a woman where it meant more to her than it did to you?
UNK: No.
Lauren : - Hi, Kate. - Hi, Lauren.
Kate : - Hi, Lauren. - Hi, pig!
UNK: - Sorry I scared you in there. - It's okay.
Monica : By the way...
Monica : ...I was just checking the shower massager.
Monica : I tried to reach you at work.
UNK: There's been a fire.
UNK: What? Oh, my God!
Joey : What happened?
Ross : We believe it originated here...
Phoebe : ...in the Aroma Room.
Phoebe : Did everyone get out okay?
UNK: The giraffe's okay, and so is the pirate.
Phoebe : - What is this? - No, don't look!
UNK: You don't want to see what's under there!
Phoebe : The foster puppets!
UNK: It's not a big deal. It's right here, and it's all the time.
Joanna : Well, thanks again for lunch.
UNK: - Yes. This was pleasant. - It was, wasn't it?
UNK: - The food there was great. - Wasn't it?
Chandler : So take care.
Joanna : You too.
UNK: This was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again!
UNK: Great. I'm looking forward to it.
Joanna : - Rachel, any messages? - Sophie's desk.
Rachel : - Are you gonna call her? - No.
UNK: I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.
UNK: You are gonna tell her. You'll tell her now.
UNK: I'm not gonna call you.
UNK: What?
UNK: I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not.
UNK: It's just that I was trying to be nice, and you don't deserve that.
UNK: - I see. I think. - Look, this has nothing to do with you.
UNK: And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me.
UNK: I have serious problems when it comes to women.
Chandler : I have issues with commitment, intimacy...
Chandler : ...mascara goop.
UNK: I'm really sorry. It's just that this isn't going to work out.
UNK: Well, this isn't how I was hoping this would end...
Joanna : ...but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
UNK: Yeah. Okay.
UNK: So...
UNK: This is great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again!
Joey : So anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is...
UNK: ...I should have considered your feelings before I went home with you.
UNK: I've recently learned what it's like to be on your side of it...
UNK: ...and I'm sorry.
Joey : So do you think you can forgive me?
Joey : Great. Thanks.
Joey : Okay. Bye.
Joey : Hello, Jennifer?
UNK: Hi, Mrs. Laurio. Is Jennifer there?
UNK: She's not home, huh?
UNK: Well, actually, I need to talk to you too.
