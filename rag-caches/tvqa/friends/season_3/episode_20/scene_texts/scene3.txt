Phoebe : Watch. Watch.
Phoebe : And. And.
UNK: Hey, my father's house does that.
Rachel : Okay. How did it go? Tell me everything!
Chandler : The movie was great...
UNK: ...dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
UNK: Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
Joanna : Chandler is fantastic!
Joey : - What? - We click! You know how people click?
UNK: He came by to pick me up, I opened the door and it was just like, "click!"
Joanna : Did he tell you?
UNK: He's got such a good heart. Doesn't he have a good heart?
UNK: And he's so sweet. He said he'd call, so put him straight through.
UNK: - Isn't this great? - Don't spoil it.
UNK: Come on, baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
UNK: It's you. Just one sec.
UNK: I'm going to take this call.
UNK: The Director : When I continue, I hope that there will appear on-stage...
UNK: The Director : ...this magical thing that in the theater we call...
UNK: The Director : ...committing to the moment!
UNK: The guy's like a cartoon.
Joey : - What do you see in him, anyway? - He happens to be brilliant.
Kate : Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
UNK: I'm not interested in her sweater.
UNK: It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.
UNK: And besides, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
UNK: I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
Kate : Do you want me to want you to care?
Lauren : Do you?
UNK: What?
UNK: Okay. I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
UNK: Come on, baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
UNK: I've got no reason to stay.
UNK: The Director : Stop! Stop it! You must stop!
UNK: The Director : You are bad actors!
UNK: The Director : This is a terrible play!
UNK: I'll see you in the morning.
UNK: I can't believe we go on in a week.
UNK: Hey, it's gonna be all right.
UNK: So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
UNK: What?
Lauren : At the place I told you about last night?
UNK: Yeah, with the mug-painting.
Joey : I was so listening to that.
UNK: But you know what? I need to work on my stuff tonight.
UNK: Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
Rachel : Good night.
Joey : - Are you okay? - Yeah, I guess.
Kate : What are we gonna do about the scene?
UNK: I don't know.
Kate : Maybe if it had more heat.
UNK: Well, how do you mean?
UNK: Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?
UNK: Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta...
UNK: He's gotta really give her a reason.
Joey : Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Kate : Or maybe...
Kate : Maybe he could grab her, and lift her up.
UNK: Then Adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist.
UNK: She could do that.
UNK: And claw at his back.
UNK: Right. Then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and his stomach.
Joey : Then he could use his teeth to undo her dress...
Joey : ...and bite her!
UNK: And then right when the scene ends...
Kate : ...he could take her with this raw, animal...
Joey : Something like that?
UNK: Yeah. That's pretty much what I had in mind.
UNK: It's a little early to be drinking.
