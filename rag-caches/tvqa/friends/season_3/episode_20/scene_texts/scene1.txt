Rachel : Thanks for lunch. You didn't have to walk me here.
UNK: That's okay. No problem.
UNK: You do realize we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office.
UNK: Yes, I realize that.
Rachel : - Summer catalog. - That's the stuff.
UNK: Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.
UNK: You don't work for me.
Rachel : Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing. Joanna.
UNK: Bing? That's a great name.
UNK: Thanks. It's Gaelic for, "Thy turkey's done."
UNK: - I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you. - You too.
UNK: So, what's wrong with him?
UNK: Nothing. He's just goofy like that. I actually hardly notice it anymore.
UNK: No, no. I mean, is he married or involved with anyone?
UNK: He's not married or involved with anyone.
UNK: Well, Rachel...
UNK: Actually, you know what? Forget it.
UNK: - I'll ask him for you, if you want. - Would you?
UNK: Or is it too sad and desperate, something that Sophie would do?
Sophie : - I am here. - I know that.
Monica : Look at it!
UNK: Wallpaper's a little faded. That's okay.
UNK: Carpet's a little loose.
Monica : Hardwood floors?!
UNK: - It's so beautiful! - I know!
UNK: So I'm here, ready to play!
Phoebe : I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out.
UNK: What's this?
UNK: That's a dog. Every house should have a dog.
Monica : Not one that can pee on the roof.
UNK: Maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Chandler : And is this in case the house sneezes?
UNK: No, that's the ghost for the attic.
UNK: - I don't want a ghost. - Well, nobody wants a ghost.
UNK: But you've got one...
Phoebe : ...because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Ross : Wait a minute. The house was built on radioactive waste...
Ross : ...and an ancient Indian burial ground?
Ross : That would never happen.
UNK: Obviously you don't know much about the U.S. Government.
Rachel : - I need to talk to you. - Sure. What's up?
Rachel : Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
Joanna : I know.
Ross : Well, if something comes up...
Chandler : I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Rachel : My boss. Joanna. When you left...
Rachel : ...she started asking questions about you...
Chandler : Liked what she saw?
