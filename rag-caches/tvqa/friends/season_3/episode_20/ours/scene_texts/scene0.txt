UNK: You're telling me this actress person...
Chandler : ...is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?
Joey : Oh, my God.
UNK: Is this what it's like to be you?
UNK: - You're crazy about her, huh? - You have no idea.
UNK: When we're on-stage, I get to kiss her and touch her.
Joey : She goes home with the director...
UNK: ...and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart.
UNK: It's so great to see you feeling like this.
Ross : Dad called this morning.
UNK: Aunt Sylvia passed away.
Monica : Yes! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ross : We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Phoebe : Am I missing something?
UNK: I always thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.
UNK: Well, Aunt Sylvia was...
Ross : ...not a nice person.
Monica : She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.
UNK: And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Ross : - You get the dollhouse. - I get the dollhouse!
Phoebe : A house for dolls! That is so cool.
UNK: When I was a kid, I had a barrel.
Joey : You had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Phoebe : No, just a barrel.
UNK: You know what? You can play with my dollhouse.
Monica : - Really? - Any time you want.
Monica : When I was younger, all I wanted was to play with this dollhouse.
Monica : But no! It was to be looked at, never played with.
Chandler : My grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
UNK: More of a bathtub-type situation.
UNK: She did give you one chance.
UNK: She told Monica she could play with the dollhouse if she lost 20 pounds.
UNK: Yeah, well, look who's losing weight now, Aunt Sylvia.
