UNK: Things finally happened with Kate.
UNK: - You're kidding? - That's great.
Joey : It was so amazing.
UNK: After the lovemaking...
Joey : Oh, my!
UNK: ...I just watched her sleep for hours.
Joey : Just breathing in...
Joey : ...and breathing out.
Joey : And then I knew she was dreaming because her eyes kept going like this :
UNK: I'm telling you, Joanna's got it all wrong.
UNK: All I said was, "This was fun. Let's do it again some time.
UNK: I'll give you a call."
UNK: I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
UNK: That's what you say at the end of a date.
UNK: You can't just say, "Nice to meet you. Good night"?
Chandler : To her face?
UNK: I'm so happy.
UNK: It's the end of the date. I'm standing there...
UNK: ...all she's waiting for is for me to say I'll call her, and it just comes out.
UNK: I can't help it. It's a compulsion.
UNK: When a guy says he'll call, it doesn't mean he's going to call.
UNK: This never happened to you?
Rachel : Well, they always called.
Monica : Bite me.
Joanna : - Did he call? - No, sorry.
UNK: Why? He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
UNK: Maybe he's intimidated by really smart, strong, successful women.
UNK: Sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.
UNK: Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
UNK: Well, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
UNK: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
UNK: The person that should feel awkward is you. Did you tell him not to call me?
UNK: If you're uncomfortable with him dating someone you work for...
UNK: ...there are always ways to fix that.
Rachel : Call her. Call her now!
Chandler : Multiple so many paper cuts.
UNK: "Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why, why? I don't understand!
UNK: He said he'd call. Why?"
UNK: I'm telling you, she's flipped out! She's gone crazy!
Chandler : Well, give me the phone then.
UNK: This isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault you haven't called.
Rachel : - You have to call her. - Look...
UNK: ...you can't call somebody after this long to say :
UNK: "In case you didn't notice, I don't like you."
UNK: - Then you'll have to take her out again. - No!
UNK: She's really dull, and she gets this...
UNK: ...gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye!
UNK: I don't care! You're gonna have to take her out again and end it.
UNK: And end it in a way that she knows it's actually ended.
UNK: I don't care how hard it is. Don't tell her you'll call her again!
UNK: All right, fine! But it's just a lunch date. No more than an hour.
Chandler : From now on, I get my own dates. I don't want you setting me up again!
UNK: That's fine!
UNK: - That's just a lot of big talk. - I know.
UNK: I'm in the shower.
UNK: Fire! There's a fire! Fire!
