Chandler : Dug my action, did she?
UNK: Checking out the Chan Chan Man!
Rachel : That was...
UNK: ...surreal.
UNK: What do you think? Are you interested at all?
Chandler : Yeah. She seemed cool. Attractive. I'll do it.
UNK: Thank you. This is so great. She's gonna love me.
Phoebe : Dinosaur attack! Quick, everybody into the house!
UNK: All right, Phoebe, you know what? That's it. That's it. All right?
Monica : No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?
UNK: They're not the right size, they're not Victorian and they don't go.
UNK: Fine.
UNK: Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
UNK: While we're hovering around the subject, I just have to say that dinosaurs...
UNK: ...they don't go, "ruff!"
Phoebe : The little ones do.
Joey : - Hey, Kate. - Morning.
UNK: I went to that restaurant you were talking about...
UNK: The Director : Hey, lovely.
UNK: Come, talk to me for a minute.
UNK: And I ate the food. It was good. I had the fish. Yeah, really good.
UNK: I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.
Joey : - Joey Tribbiani. - I know.
UNK: I'm a big fan of yours.
UNK: What?
UNK: I used to schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...
Lauren : ...on Days of our Lives.
Joey : - Get out of here. Really? - Absolutely.
Lauren : But then they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
Joey : They gave me the shaft, all right.
UNK: You're so funny.
Lauren : What are you doing after rehearsal?
Lauren : - Want to get a drink or something? - Well...
Joey : Yeah. Sure. A drink sounds great.
UNK: - Cool. I'll see you then. - All right.
UNK: All right. It's time to act, my talking props.
UNK: If you wanna make the boys' bathroom realistic...
UNK: ...you're gonna have to put some teeny, tiny porno magazines behind the toilet.
Phoebe : Look everybody! Look at my new dollhouse!
Phoebe : Look, look!
UNK: Hey, what's this?
UNK: It's a slide instead of stairs. Look.
Monica : Very interesting, Phoebe.
UNK: What's this?
Phoebe : The licorice room. You can eat all the furniture.
Phoebe : When guests come over, they can stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.
Ross : This is the coolest house ever!
UNK: Does anyone want to join me in the Aroma Room?
Monica : - All right. - I would.
Monica : Hey, guys? Guys!
Monica : Did you see my new china cabinet?
