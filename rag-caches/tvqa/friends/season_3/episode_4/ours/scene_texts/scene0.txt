Host : Welcome, everybody! Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
UNK: It's on again!
UNK: Guys, could we please not watch this?
UNK: This ever happen to you? You go to get a glass of milk...
UNK: ...but these cartons are so flinging, flanging hard to open!
UNK: Boy, you said it, Mike.
UNK: - There's gotta be a better way. - There is, Kevin!
UNK: - Can we please turn this off? - No way, Kevin!
UNK: What if I told you there's a new product that guarantees...
Mike : ...you'll never have to open up milk cartons again?
UNK: Meet the Milkmaster 2000!
UNK: - Intrigued? - You're flinging, flanging right I am!
UNK: This is the first time he's used this. You'll see how easy this is to do.
UNK: - This works in any milk carton. - Wow, it is easy!
UNK: Now I can have milk every day.
UNK: I can't watch this anymore.
UNK: You've suffered enough. We'll change it.
UNK: - How many times has this happened? - There's gotta be a better way!
Chandler : It's official. There are no good movies.
UNK: So let's go to a bad one, and make out.
UNK: Perhaps you'd like me to turn so you can bunny-bump against my back?
Chandler : - Hey, man. What's up? - Maybe you can tell me.
UNK: My agent wants to know why I didn't show up at my audition today...
UNK: ...my first good one in weeks. How could you not give me the message?
UNK: I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...
UNK: ...but it wasn't me.
Phoebe : Yes, it was. It was him!
Phoebe : Okay, it was me!
UNK: - How was it you? - Well, it was all so crazy, you know?
Phoebe : Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10...
Phoebe : ...and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
Phoebe : I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See? All of it.
Joey : Yep, that's my audition.
Monica : See? Now, this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Phoebe : Yep. And that's why we don't invite you to play.
Janice : What is the great tragedy here? Get yourself another appointment.
UNK: Estelle tried. The casting director told her I missed my chance.
UNK: Well, that is unfair!
Phoebe : I'll call her. I'll tell her it was my fault.
UNK: You can't. The casting director doesn't talk to friends.
Joey : - She only talks to agents. - What a sad little life she must lead.
Joey : - What are you doing? - No, I know, I know.
UNK: Hi, this is Caitlin from Phoebe Buffay's office.
UNK: Is Anne there for Phoebe?
Phoebe : She'll know what it's about.
UNK: Hang up. Hang up right...
UNK: Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani.
Phoebe : Apparently, he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office?
UNK: Estelle? I don't know what to do with her.
Phoebe : So your husband leaves and burns down the apartment. The world doesn't stop.
Chandler : Is anybody else scared?
UNK: If Joey loses this audition, then that is it for Estelle. I don't care!
Phoebe : Annie, you are a doll. What time can you see him? I need a pen. Pen!
Chandler : Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
