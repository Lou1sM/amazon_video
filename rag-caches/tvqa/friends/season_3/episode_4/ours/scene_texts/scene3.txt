UNK: Don't go! I've scared you! I've said too much!
Chandler : I'm hopeless and awkward and desperate for love!
Chandler : Hey, Janice, it's me.
UNK: I wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
UNK: Here you go, honey. This will help.
UNK: So I catch up to her and she says...
UNK: ...this relationship's going too fast and we have to slow down.
Monica : That is never good.
Chandler : Then I got all...
Chandler : ...needy and clingy.
UNK: - You didn't beg, did you? - I said please.
UNK: Was it please with one E in the middle or lots of E's?
UNK: Oh, dear Lord, I begged.
Rachel : Wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Chandler : She said she'd call me.
Chandler : Oh, God.
Monica : Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Chandler : This ice cream tastes like crap, by the way.
UNK: Yeah, well, it's that low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.
Rachel : We save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases.
UNK: When you're getting screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low fat.
Rachel : Yeah, you do.
Chandler : You don't think I'm terminal?
Monica : Not at all. You're not terminal. We just need some damage control.
UNK: - Okay. Should I call her? - No!
UNK: Very critical time. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone...
UNK: ...go shopping, get your butt in a bubble bath.
UNK: If you want her back, you have got to start acting aloof.
UNK: Aloof?
UNK: She needs to know you're not needy.
UNK: So what you have to do is accidentally run into her on purpose...
Rachel : ...and then act aloof.
UNK: - And then I'll be okay? - Yeah. I think so.
Chandler : So I'm not gonna lose her?
Rachel : Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.
UNK: I said, "So I'm not gonna lose her?"
Ross : Guess who's here!
UNK: It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!
Ross : Real American hero I'm G.I. Joe!
UNK: Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.
Ross : G.I. Joe? You really think he'll fall for that?
Ross : G.I. Joe? Cool! Can I play?
Ross : Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects U.S. Oil interests overseas!
UNK: Joey And Ross : Go, Joe!
UNK: Hello?
Joey : - There you are! - No, it's not. Sorry.
Joey : But, Phoebe, wait, wait. Phoebe!
Phoebe : Oh, Joey! Oh, okay! See, I didn't recognize you...
UNK: ...in those pants.
Joey : That TV movie I went in for, did you hear anything? I think I got a shot.
Phoebe : Yes, they called! You didn't get it!
Phoebe : Okay? I mean, you didn't get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
UNK: That's okay. These things happen.
Phoebe : But they shouldn't happen. You know what?
Phoebe : You're in a terrible, terrible business.
UNK: I don't want to be the person who makes you look like that.
Joey : I'm okay. See?
Phoebe : Now you're sad and creepy.
Phoebe : I'm sorry. I quit.
Joey : No, no, you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had.
UNK: Rejection is part of being an actor. You can't take it personal.
UNK: They said they'd never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Joey : They actually said that?
Phoebe : Oh, God, there's that face again. See? I can't do this job!
UNK: This is why you have to do this job! Agents always lie.
Joey : Estelle just says stuff like, "They went another way."
Joey : But this? I can use this.
UNK: I can work on a new accent.
UNK: Yeah, okay. If it helps you, okay. Yeah.
Ross : You'll never get me, Joe!
Janice : No, thank you.
UNK: [scene : - Chandler! - Hello, Janice.
