Chandler : Hello? Hi, Janice.
Chandler : Can you hold on for a second? Okay.
Chandler : Okay. What do I do?
Phoebe : I don't know. This is unprecedented.
UNK: If we did what you did, a man would never call.
UNK: I got it! Pretend you just woke up. That'll throw her off!
Monica : - Be sleepy! - Yes! And grumpy!
Joey : What are you...? Stop naming dwarfs!
Chandler : Hello, Janice? Hi.
Chandler : I'm so glad that you called.
Chandler : I know I've been acting really weird lately...
Chandler : ...and it's just because I'm crazy about you...
UNK: ...and I just got stupid and scared...
UNK: ...and stupid a couple more times.
UNK: And I'm sorry.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Really?
UNK: He's so lucky. If Janice were a guy...
Rachel : ...she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Chandler : I love you too.
UNK: It's so unfair!
UNK: G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!
Ross : I don't know what to tell you guys. That's the doll he chose.
Susan : What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
UNK: Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.
Ross : And if you guys can't deal with it, that's just your too bad.
Monica : What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbie. Big deal.
Monica : You used to dress up like a woman.
UNK: What?
UNK: The way you used to dress up in Mom's clothes?
Ross : What are you talking about?
Monica : The big hat, the pearls, the little pink handbag?
Ross : Okay. You are totally making this up.
Monica : How can you not remember?
UNK: You made us call you "Bea"?
Chandler : Oh, God.
Susan : I've literally never been this happy.
Monica : Wasn't there a little song?
Carol : Oh, please, God, let there be a song.
Ross : There was no song. There was no song.
Monica : - I am Bea - Okay.
Monica : - I drink tea... - That's enough.
Monica : Won't you...?
Monica : Won't you...?
Monica : Won't you...?
Ross : Won't you dance around with me?
Monica : I am Bea
Monica : I drink tea
Ross : Won't you dance around with...?
UNK: Ross!
