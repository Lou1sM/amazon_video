Monica : Oh, now you want a pad.
UNK: That's funny. Ugly Naked Guy's naked, but his dog's wearing a sweater.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Where's my boy?
Ross : Here's my boy!
UNK: And here's his Barbie!
UNK: What's my boy doing with a Barbie?
UNK: He picked it out at the store. He loves it.
Susan : He carries it everywhere, like a security blanket.
Susan : But with ski boots and a kicky beret.
UNK: Yeah, it's cute.
Ross : Why does he have it again?
Susan : So he's got a doll. So what?
Susan : Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up to be...
Susan : ...in show business.
UNK: This wouldn't have to do with the fact...
UNK: ...that he's being raised by two women?
Ross : You know what? It's fine. If you're okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.
UNK: Give Daddy the Barbie. Give me the Barbie.
UNK: Don't you wanna play with a monster truck?
Ross : No? Okay.
UNK: How about a Dino-Soldier?
Rachel : You are so pathetic.
Rachel : Why can't your son just play with his doll?
Monica : I gotta go to work.
Monica : Has anybody seen my left boob?
UNK: I loved that movie.
Monica : Here it is. What are you doing?
Joey : I'm sorry. It just felt nice.
Chandler : Answer the phone.
UNK: I only got one arm. You should do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.
UNK: Just do it! It's Janice.
UNK: And if I get it, I'll have to see her tonight.
Chandler : That's great. I'll have to see her tonight.
UNK: Why don't you want to see Janice?
Chandler : Last night at dinner, when the meals came...
Chandler : ...she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took all my tomatoes.
Ross : And that's bad...
Ross : ...because you hate chicken piccata?
Ross : You didn't want to share your tomatoes. Tomatoes are very important to you.
UNK: Suddenly, we were this "couple."
UNK: And this alarm started going off in my head.
UNK: "Run for your life! Get out of the building!"
UNK: Men are unbelievable. Janice thought she was giving you chicken.
UNK: She didn't think she was giving you scary chicken.
Monica : What is it with you people?
UNK: The minute you feel something, you have to run away?
Chandler : I know. That...
Chandler : That's why I don't want to go tonight. I'm afraid I'll say something stupid.
UNK: You mean that "guy thing" where you act mean and distant...
UNK: ...until we break up with you?
Joey : You know about that?
Chandler : What do I do? I wanna get past this.
UNK: I don't want to be afraid of commitment.
UNK: I want to go through the tunnel to the other side!
UNK: Where there's no fear of commitment.
Chandler : Do we have any...
Chandler : Do we have any thoughts here?
Joey : I've never been through the tunnel myself because...
UNK: ...you're not allowed through with more than one girl in the car.
Joey : But it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else. Face your fear.
Joey : Fear of heights? Go to the top of the building.
Joey : You're afraid of bugs.
Joey : Get a bug.
Joey : You have a fear of commitment.
UNK: So I say you go in there and you be the most committed guy there ever was!
Rachel : Amazingly, that makes sense.
UNK: - Do you think? - Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!
Joey : Jump off the high dive!
Joey : Stare down the barrel of the gun! Pee into the wind!
Chandler : If I'm staring down the barrel of a gun...
UNK: ...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing every which way.
