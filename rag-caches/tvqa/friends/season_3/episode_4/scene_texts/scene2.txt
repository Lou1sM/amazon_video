UNK: Listen to this and tell me what you think.
UNK: That's interesting.
Rachel : - Honey? - Oh, because it's a beeper.
Phoebe : It's your audition from this morning! Can I use the phone?
UNK: Sure, that's what it's there for. Emergencies and pretend agents.
Joey : Come on, baby! Come on!
Phoebe : Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.
UNK: Okay, she's in her car. I'll have to patch you through.
Rachel : Very nice touch.
Phoebe : Okay, go ahead.
UNK: Talk, talk, talk!
Phoebe : Hi, Annie?
UNK: Fantastic. You got it!
Phoebe : Will he work for scale, you ask me? Well, I don't know about that.
Phoebe : Except that I do and he will.
Phoebe : Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.
Phoebe : I would love to have lunch with you! How about we have lunch next...
Phoebe : Went through a tunnel.
UNK: Unbelievable.
UNK: Oh, thank you so much!
Phoebe : It was really fun. I mean, I've never talked on a car phone before.
UNK: You are so amazing! Could you do me this huge favor?
UNK: There's another audition I want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Phoebe : I don't know. It was fun one time, but...
UNK: Please? It would just be this one more.
Joey : - Well, actually it's two. - Two?
Joey : Well, really it's three. Please? You're so good at it. I love you.
UNK: - Okay. But just these three, right? - No, it's four.
Janice : So how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
UNK: Because I wanted...
Chandler : ...to give you this.
Janice : Are you a puppy!
Janice : Contact paper!
UNK: What do you say when someone you're sleeping with...
Janice : ...gives you contact paper?
UNK: Wait, there's more. See, the contact paper is to go...
UNK: ...in your brand new drawer!
Chandler : See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Janice : - You didn't have to do this. - Yes, I did.
Chandler : Yes, I did. Because you're my girlfriend...
Chandler : ...and that's what girlfriends should get.
Janice : Well, I gotta buy a vowel...
UNK: ...because, oh, my God!
Janice : Who would've thought that someday...
Janice : ...Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?

Chandler : But that's what's happened. And there's more.
Chandler : We should take a trip.
Chandler : We should?
Chandler : We're a couple, and that's what couples do.
Chandler : And I wanna meet your parents.
Chandler : We should take a trip with your parents!
Janice : I don't think we need to because you're tripping me out right now!
Janice : - Are you okay? - No, I am.
UNK: I actually am! This is amazing.
Chandler : My entire life, I have feared this place.
Chandler : And now that I'm here, it's like, what was the big deal?
