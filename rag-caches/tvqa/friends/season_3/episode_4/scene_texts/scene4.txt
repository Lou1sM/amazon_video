Janice : What are you doing here?
Chandler : Just a bit of shopping.
UNK: How have you been?
Janice : Are you being British?
Chandler : Not anymore.
Janice : Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood.
Janice : Were you here waiting for me?
Chandler : I'm just...
Chandler : ...picking up some things for a party.
UNK: Barley?
Janice : What kind of party serves barley?
Chandler : I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Janice : - Where is this party? - Here in Chelsea.
UNK: Whose party is it?
Chandler : A woman's.
Janice : What woman?
UNK: Chelsea.
Janice : Either you're seeing somebody behind my back...
Janice : ...which would make you the world's biggest jerk...
UNK: ...or you're pretending to see somebody...
UNK: ...which makes you so pathetic I could cry right here!
UNK: So which of these two guys do you want to be?
Chandler : Can I be that guy?
UNK: Okay, we got some more good rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.
