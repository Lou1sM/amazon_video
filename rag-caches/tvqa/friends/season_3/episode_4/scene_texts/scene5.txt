Joey : Okay. Shoot.
Phoebe : - Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial. - I didn't get it?
UNK: No. They said that you "weren't believable as a human being."
Phoebe : So you can work on that.
UNK: Great.
Joey : What else?
UNK: The off-Broadway-play people said that you were "pretty but dumb."
Phoebe : Oh, no wait. I'm sorry. That's "pretty dumb."
Joey : Look, it's okay, no, no, no. Really.
UNK: Look...
Joey : ...I really appreciate this...
UNK: ...but I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Joey : Don't get me wrong. You're a better agent than she is...
Joey : ...but at least with her, I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Phoebe : Yeah, no, I understand.
UNK: You do? Thanks. Okay.
UNK: Sorry.
Rachel : Wait a minute.
Rachel : Wait a minute.
UNK: Did you make all that stuff up to get out of being my agent?
UNK: Oh, he caught me.
Phoebe : I am so busted!
UNK: That's what I suspected!
Chandler : And then I just, you know...
Chandler : ...threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.
