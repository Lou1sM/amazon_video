UNK: Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
Joey : You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Chandler : That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!
Joey : Look at me! I'm Chandler.
Joey : Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Joey : Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
UNK: It's hot with all this stuff on.
Joey : I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Ross : Okay, enough. Enough with the lunging.
Ross : I'm sick of this. I've had it up to here.
UNK: Neither of you can come to the party!
Chandler : Jeez, what a baby!
Joey : Way to ruin it. I was gonna go get dressed.
Ross : The only person I cared about getting dressed...
UNK: ...is the person who's not even gonna go.
Ross : Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
UNK: Look, I was a jerk, okay? I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there.
Ross : I need you there.
