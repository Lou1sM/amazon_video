Joey : All right, they got water, orange juice...
Joey : ...and what looks like cider.
Chandler : Taste it.
UNK: Yeah, it's fat. I drank fat!
Chandler : I know, I did that two minutes ago.
UNK: Hey, Mr. Tux.
UNK: - Why aren't you dressed? - We have a half-hour.
UNK: That was four minutes ago. We have to be out the door at 7 : 40.
UNK: Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us two minutes to get dressed.
UNK: I'd feel better if you got dressed now.
UNK: Chandler And Joey : - Okay. - Okay.
Rachel : Oh, look at you. All sexy.
UNK: Really?
Rachel : - How come you didn't come over earlier? - Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Joey : - Hey, Ross, want some cider? - No.
UNK: So you're pretty close, huh?
Ross : - Makeup's on. Hair's done. - I just have to get dressed.
Ross : And that takes what, six or seven minutes?
Rachel : Yeah. Once I figure out what I'm wearing.
Joey : Glass of fat?
UNK: What's the matter? You nervous about your speech?
UNK: Nope.
Ross : - You wanna hear it? - Am I in it?
Ross : After I thank everyone for giving to the museum...
Ross : ...I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Ross : Hello! You look great!
Phoebe : Thank you. I know, though.
Ross : You see this? This is a person who is ready to go.
Ross : Phoebe, you...
Ross : You are my star.
Phoebe : Well, you're my lucky penny.
Chandler : All right, I took the quiz. And it turns out I do put career before men.
Chandler : Get up.
UNK: What?
Chandler : - You're in my seat. - How is this your seat?
UNK: - Because I was sitting there. - But you left.
Chandler : Well, it's not like I went to Spain.
Chandler : I went to the bathroom. You knew I'd be back.
Joey : What's the big deal? Sit somewhere else!
Chandler : The big deal is I was sitting there last! So...
UNK: ...it's my seat.
Joey : Well, actually, the last place you were sitting was in there, so...
Ross : You guys, you know what? It doesn't matter.
Ross : You both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops.
Chandler : I just have to do one thing. It's not a big deal.
Chandler : Get up!
Monica : Phoebe, you look great!
UNK: All right already.
Monica : Are you gonna do magic?
Ross : That's funny. Change.
Monica : - I just got in. - I don't care.
UNK: - It starts at 8. We can't be late. - He could not, would not, want to wait.
UNK: Our table is in front. My boss will be there.
Ross : Everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Monica : Has somebody been drinking my fat?
UNK: Does this look like something a paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?
Phoebe : I don't know. You might be the first one.
Monica : - Rach, did you check the machine? - No.
UNK: Wait. This is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Never mind.
UNK: Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today.
UNK: It's called, "Get up!"
UNK: I wish there was something I could do to help you.
UNK: Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
