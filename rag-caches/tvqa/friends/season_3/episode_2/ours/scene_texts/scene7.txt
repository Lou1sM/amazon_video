UNK: What can I do to show you how much I want you to be there?
Joey : You could drink the fat.
Ross : Welcome to an adult conversation.
Ross : No, no, no. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.
UNK: - That actually sounds interesting. - What?
Rachel : I think you should drink the fat.
UNK: Okay, if that's what it takes to show you how much you mean to me...
Ross : ...and how much I want you there, that's what I'll do.
Phoebe : Let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Ross : I think this will be fine.
Ross : Okay, vanilla milkshake. Just a vanilla milkshake...
Ross : ...with chicken bits floating in it.
UNK: Cheers.
UNK: No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go. I'll go.
Chandler : You will?
Rachel : - You were really gonna do that. - Well, yeah.
