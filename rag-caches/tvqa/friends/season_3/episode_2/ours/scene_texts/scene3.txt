Joey : Where's my underwear?
UNK: - Come on, you took his underwear? - He took my essence!
UNK: Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Joey : Because I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Ross : Why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Joey : It's a rented tux, okay?
Joey : I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
UNK: Then somebody's gonna have to give somebody back his cushions.
Joey : Okay. You hide my clothes, I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Chandler : What, are you gonna show me my clothes?
Joey : Hey, opposite...
Joey : ...is opposite.
