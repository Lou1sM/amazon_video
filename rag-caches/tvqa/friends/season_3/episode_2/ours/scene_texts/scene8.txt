Rachel : You were gonna drink the fat.
Joey : Let's see what else he'll do!
UNK: How about you get changed? Give him his underwear.
UNK: I'll get a cab. I want everyone downstairs in two minutes.
UNK: Monica!
Chandler : Stop it. Stop it!
Phoebe : Ross went to get a cab, so we...
Phoebe : What are you doing? No, Monica, no!
Richard : Hi, this is Richard.
Machine : You have three new messages.
UNK: Not anymore.
Machine : Message erased.
UNK: To record your message, begin speaking at the tone.
Monica : Hi, Richard. It's Monica.
Monica : Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.
Monica : Maybe I'm getting my period or something. I don't know.
Monica : I beeped into your machine and I heard this message that freaked me out...
Ross : You know what? Michelle will tell you the rest.
UNK: I'm sorry, okay? And I hope that we can just forget the whole thing.
Machine : Your outgoing message has now been changed.
UNK: Outgoing?
Monica : Did that say outgoing? Not outgoing!
Monica : Hi, Richard, it's Monica.
Monica : Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.
Monica : Maybe I'm getting my period or something.
Phoebe : - How did you do that? - I don't know!
Machine : - Goodbye. - No!
Ross : Okay. Okay. Okay, I've got two cabs and no people! Go, go, go!
UNK: Maybe we can call the phone company to change the message?
UNK: They could change his number.
UNK: I think after this, he'll be doing that himself.
UNK: Rachel!
UNK: You... You look...
Rachel : And I still have about five seconds to spare.
Rachel : - That was about seven seconds. - So we're a little late.
Rachel : Come on.
Rachel : - Oh, and by the way... - What?
Rachel : I'm going commando too.
UNK: So I said, "Who are you Cro-Magnum P.I.?"
UNK: Sherman Whitfield : Dr. Geller?
UNK: Sherman Whitfield : - Sherman Whitfield, London Institute. - What a pleasure.
Whitfield : I was quite impressed with your paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.
UNK: Yes. It confirmed everything I'd written.
Chandler : Excuse me.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Yes?
UNK: Well, you're kind of sitting in my seat.
Whitfield : What do you mean, your seat?
Chandler : - I mean, I was sitting there. - But you got up.
Chandler : But I never left the room.
Whitfield : But you left the chair area.
Chandler : That's it. Give me your underwear.
