Joey : All right. You can have the chair.
Ross : - Really? - Oh, my. Would you look at that?
Phoebe : It's me, I'm coming over.
Phoebe : What if I'm already there when you play this message?
Phoebe : Is that too spooky?
Ross : Hi, Rach, are you there? It's me. Pick up.
Ross : Rachel? Rach?
UNK: What?
UNK: Never mind.
UNK: Hi, Rach, it's your sister.
UNK: Did you ever sleep with Donnie Mazzio because last night he kept shouting :
UNK: "Two for two."
UNK: Do you want me to get dressed or hear a long story about a hayride?
UNK: Are you only asking him because...
Richard : Monica, it's Richard. Call me.
Monica : Is that message old or new?
Monica : Old or new? Old or new?
Ross : It's definitely old. Didn't you hear the double beep?
Monica : What if it's new? We agreed not to talk.
UNK: It could be important. Shouldn't I call him back?
Chandler : Honey, you did call him back. It's old.
Ross : Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.
Ross : When Carol and I broke up...
Ross : ...I went through the same thing. You know what I did?
UNK: I got dressed.
Ross : Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?
Ross : There we go. There we go.
UNK: You know what? Don't get up. Just sit there.
Chandler : I just hope you don't mind my hand right here.
Chandler : Not touching. Can't get mad! Not touching. Can't get mad!
Chandler : Not touching. Can't get mad!
Phoebe : Oh, my God! You rotten boys!
UNK: Chandler And Joey : - Sorry, Phoebe. - What am I gonna do?
UNK: Don't rub it! What gets out hummus? What gets out hummus?
UNK: Monica! What gets out hummus?
Monica : If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Phoebe : Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
UNK: Maybe he called to say you're obsessive.
Monica : - So should I call him back? - No!
UNK: No!
UNK: Okay, do these match?
UNK: - Yes, they definitely match. - They don't match.
UNK: What? They didn't match.
UNK: - Fine, we'll both sit in the chair. - Fine with me.
UNK: I am so comfortable.
Joey : Me too.
Joey : In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Joey : All right.
UNK: Okay, we have 19 minutes. I want you to go and change.
Ross : When you come back, Joey will go change and he'll have vacated the chair.
UNK: Chandler And Joey : - Okay. - All right.
Chandler : Fine. I'm going.
UNK: When I get back, it's Chair City. And I'm the guy...
UNK: ...who's sitting in a chair!
Rachel : Is this a little too...?
Rachel : Pheebs? What happened?
Phoebe : I got the hummus.
UNK: Oh, honey, we'll find you something. You wanna wear my black jacket?
UNK: - It won't go with this dress. - You're right.
UNK: - Well, let's just get you out of that. - No, no, no. Not "out of that."
Ross : - Not out of clothes. - Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Monica : I called him.
UNK: Yes. I got his machine and I left a message.
Monica : But it's okay. It's okay...
UNK: ...because it was, like, a casual, breezy message.
Monica : It was breezy.
Monica : God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Phoebe : How could it not be breezy? No. Because you're in such a breezy place.
UNK: I got it. I will play my message and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
