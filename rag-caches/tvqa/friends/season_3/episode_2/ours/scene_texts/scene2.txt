UNK: But how you gonna do that?
Monica : I know the code to his answering machine.
Ross : Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the...
Ross : Okay, you're dialing. You are dialing.
UNK: - What's going on? - Monica's beeping into Richard's machine.
UNK: Is she crazy?
UNK: Like a straw.
UNK: Remember? Crazy straws?
Richard : Hi, this is Richard. Please leave a message at the tone.
Machine : You have two new messages.
Joey : Wow, what a cool job.
Machine : You have two new messages.
Joey : Please pass the pie.
Monica : Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in because I got a message...
UNK: ...from you and didn't know if it was old or new. So I'm checking.
Monica : So let me know.
Monica : Or don't. Whatever.
Monica : I'm breezy!
Joey : You can't say you're breezy. That negates the breezy.
UNK: Woman's Voice : Hola. It's me. Yesterday was really fun.
UNK: Woman's Voice : Call me about this weekend, okay?
Joey : Now, she sounded breezy.
Monica : He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Phoebe : - You don't know that. - Well, whose voice was that?
Chandler : Maybe it was his sister's. Maybe it was his daughter's.
Monica : Michelle. Of course! It was Michelle. Did it sound like Michelle?
UNK: I cannot remember her.
Ross : Great. It's starting to rain. That'll make it easier to get a cab.
Monica : It was Michelle.
Monica : It was definitely Michelle.
UNK: Try Monica's green dress. If it doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.
UNK: - Unless I wear it. - You don't know what you're wearing?
Rachel : I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Ross : Which we have to leave for in 12 minutes.
UNK: I'll pick something out for you.
UNK: - There! There! That looks good. - Ross, that's a towel!
Chandler : You will notice that I am fully dressed.
Chandler : I, in turn, have noticed that you are not.
UNK: So in the words of A.A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dill-hole."
UNK: Okay.
Chandler : - What are you doing? - You said to give you the chair.
UNK: You didn't say anything about cushions.
UNK: They're the essence of the chair!
Joey : That's right! I'm taking the essence.
UNK: Oh, he'll be back.
UNK: Oh, there's nobody in the room.
Ross : - I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty. - That was a Halloween costume.
Rachel : Unless you would like me to go as Little Bo Peep.
Ross : I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Rachel : Which, by the way, Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Phoebe : Rach, good! Listen, isn't this perfect for me?
Rachel : Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Phoebe : Of course, not for tonight. Hi. I'm going to a benefit.
Rachel : Not for tonight? What are you doing?
UNK: No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it. I love you. Breathe.
Chandler : We used them as pillows when we went camping.
UNK: What?
Chandler : The sheep.
Ross : Hey, what you do on your own time...
