Chandler : He's got nothing!
Phoebe : Okay, I'm ready.
Phoebe : Rachel didn't have anything I liked but this ribbon.
Phoebe : I thought, all right, I'll be political.
Chandler : - What are you supporting? - Christmas.
UNK: Hey, that's okay with me. Two down, and I have exactly 12 minutes...
UNK: What?
UNK: My watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see...
UNK: ...the dinosaur tail isn't going around anymore.
UNK: What time is it? It's 7 : 33. I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!
UNK: Which shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
UNK: - Just pick one, okay? - Oh, okay, okay. The black.
Phoebe : Do you have black with little strappies?
UNK: Yeah. But those go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants.
UNK: Yeah, pants! What an idea! Or better yet, go without pants.
UNK: I don't know what you're doing, but just get in there...
Ross : ...and pick out any shoes that fit your feet.
Ross : I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make...
Ross : ...your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Just do it!
UNK: Go in there, pick something out so we can go.
Joey : - All right. - Thank you.
UNK: I've got to call Michelle to see if that was her voice.
Ross : It was. It was her voice.
Chandler : Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
UNK: Hola.
Michelle : Hello? Hello?
Monica : - Okay. That was her, right? - Definitely. Yeah.
UNK: So there you go.
Monica : We're out of the woods. I think I'll get dressed now.
Phoebe : - I'll get it. - Okay.
Phoebe : Hi, Monica and Rachel's.
Phoebe : Yeah, just a second. Can I ask who's calling?
Phoebe : It's Michelle!
Phoebe : She must have that caller ID thing. You should get that.
UNK: Michelle?
Monica : Yeah, that was me. I dialed your number by mistake.
UNK: Just try to be...
Monica : You're so sweet.
Monica : Yeah, we were a great couple.
Monica : I know, I really miss him.
Monica : Well, you know how it is. It's just that...
Chandler : You know what's weird?
Chandler : Donald Duck never wore pants.
UNK: But when he gets out of the shower...
UNK: ...he always puts a towel around his waist.
Chandler : I mean, what is that about?
Monica : I only beeped in so I could hear my own message. I mean, that's allowed.
Monica : I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad about...
UNK: What do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with this? We're friends!
Monica : That bitch always hated me.
Monica : I'm calling her back.
Chandler : - Okay, fine. - Okay.
UNK: - She's got a phone in there, right? - Okay, we're on it.
UNK: I know it says "black tie optional"...
Ross : ...but this may be pushing it a little.
Joey : I'm not gonna go.
UNK: You're not gonna go?
Rachel : No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Ross : How can you not be going?
