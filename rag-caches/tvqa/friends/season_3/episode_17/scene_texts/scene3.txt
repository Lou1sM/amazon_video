UNK: ...when we can really get into it. You free for dinner tomorrow?
UNK: - Yeah. I'd love that. - Me too.
Ross : I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
UNK: - Okay. Yeah. Triple-A can pick us up. - Good.
Phoebe : - What town are we near? - Fremont.
UNK: - Westmont. Westberg? - Okay. Why are you answering?
UNK: - Do you know what route we're on? - We are definitely on Route 27.
UNK: Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27.
UNK: Okay. There is no Route 27.
Phoebe : - Okay. Either 93 or 76. - I don't know. I'm sorry.
Rachel : I always slept in the back when we drove here.
UNK: Can you just send someone up and down 76 and check every rest stop?
Phoebe : And also 93?
UNK: Okay. Yeah. No, they don't do that.
UNK: Okay. Somebody will come and save us.
UNK: Who? Have you seen a car in the last hour and a half? We should call Ross.
UNK: - He can get a car to pick us up. - No! I am not getting in a car with Ross!
Rachel : We will just have to live here.
UNK: - But it's cold. - I'm not getting in a car with him.
Rachel : - Think of something else. - Good. Joey and Chandler are back!
UNK: - So the "going for help" went well? - Yeah.
UNK: Smokey Joe here got halfway to the highway and collapsed.
Chandler : I have the lung capacity of a 2-year-old.
Monica : - Then why are you smoking? - Well, it's very unsettling.
Rachel : Right? I mean, it's pretty unbelievable.
Ross : I mean, they just took off, without even looking back.
UNK: You know, I don't need them. I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
Carol : Susan will be so pleased.
UNK: Seven-one-seven? Where's 717?
UNK: - You have more for Susan, right? - No, but that's okay.
UNK: I'll just put out pickles or something.
Phoebe : - Ross, thank God! - Pheebs?
Ross : Why are you whispering?
Phoebe : I ate a bug.
Monica : Hey, Rach! The tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
UNK: We ran out of gas and don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
UNK: Now you want a favor?
Phoebe : Yes, please.
UNK: I'm sorry your car broke down, Pheebs...
UNK: ...but I'm busy with some real friends right now.
Ross : Please call to let me know you got home safely.
UNK: Hang on a second. Take my car. Go pick up your friends.
UNK: No, I won't pick them up.
UNK: We both know you'll do it because you're not a jerk.
UNK: So you can sulk here, then go pick them up, or save time and sulk in the car.
UNK: - Rachel doesn't... - I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...
UNK: ...and you're innocent. But don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
UNK: Yeah, you're right.
UNK: Phoebe, hang on. Ross wants to tell you something. What?
Carol : You slept with someone else?
Ross : We were on a break! Okay?
UNK: We were... We were... Yeah. Where are you? I'll find you.
Carol : - You slept with another woman? - Oh, you're one to talk.
Joey : Okay, done.
UNK: What's "pleh"?
UNK: That's "help" spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air.
UNK: What's "dufus" spelled backwards?
Rachel : Car! Car!
UNK: Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
Phoebe : - Hey! - Hey!
Rachel : - What is he doing here? - He is saving your butt.
UNK: Unless I'm stepping on some toes, in which case I could just mosey on.
UNK: I've got plenty of people to help on the interstate.
UNK: - We need your help, please! - Fine! Fine!
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: Oh, no! Now it's not gonna make any sense.
UNK: You guys, what do we do about Ross? He drove all the way up here.
UNK: Just send him back, and we're gonna go skiing?
Chandler : This is horrible. It's just horrible.
Joey : You think we should ask Ross to come along?
Monica : What about Rachel? How are we gonna even ask her?
Rachel : Ask me what?
UNK: If it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
UNK: - No, I wasn't gonna ask that. - I wasn't.
Rachel : You guys are unbelievable. No, he cannot come!
Ross : - Excuse me? - It's horrible!
UNK: Oh, please? Can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Rachel : Why would you even want to come? You're a horrible skier.
Ross : Hitting me where it hurts! My ski skills!
Monica : - Here we go again. - I can't handle this.
Chandler : I can handle it. "Handle" is my middle name.
UNK: Actually, it's the middle part of my first name.
UNK: - All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready. - All right. Let's go.
