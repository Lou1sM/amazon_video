UNK: - You're welcome. - I'm sorry.
Rachel : Were you speaking to me, or sleeping with someone else?
Ross : We were on a break!
UNK: Why don't you just put that on your answering machine?
UNK: It's valid, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Monica agrees with me.
Phoebe : - What? - I don't know.
UNK: - You said it last night. - What I said was that I understood.
UNK: - Joey is the one who agreed with you. - Okay.
Rachel : Really, Joey?
UNK: What?
UNK: You know what? There is no right or wrong here.
UNK: - I think it's obvious who's wrong here. - Obviously not to Joey.
UNK: What?
UNK: - Joey and Monica feel the way I do! - You and this "innocent puppy" act!
Chandler : Guess who I am?
UNK: All right. You know what? I can't even...
Phoebe : Hey, hey, hey, hey!
UNK: Look what you're doing to Chandler!
UNK: Look. We know that this is really, really hard for you guys.
UNK: You know... You don't have to love each other.
UNK: You don't even have to like each other much right now.
UNK: But please, find a way to be around each other.
Joey : And not put us in the middle.
UNK: Yeah. I mean, otherwise, that's just it for us hanging out together.
UNK: You know? Is that what you want?
Phoebe : Can you be civil?
Joey : - Yeah. - I can.
UNK: Good. Let's get back in the car. It's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
Joey : Wait a second! I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
UNK: Look, you guys should go.
UNK: No. You know, you planned this all out, and...
UNK: ...I don't wanna ruin it. So you should just go.
Joey : - You drove all the way up here. - I've got to take the car back anyway.
UNK: I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben. It's fine, okay?
UNK: Just go. No guilt. I promise.
Rachel : Thank you.
UNK: We'll call you when we get back.
Phoebe : Maybe we can, like, go to a movie or something.
Phoebe : Or the rodeo!
Ross : - That would be great. - Okay.
UNK: I was being Shelley Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Monica : I know.
UNK: Bye!
Monica : - Ross. - Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Ross : - Were you sleeping? - No.
UNK: Oh, great, because...
UNK: I had to get you a new battery. I got the best I could.
UNK: - That's not where you wanna skimp. - You're a genius.
UNK: It came to about $ 112. But what the hell? Just call it an even 110?
UNK: Okay. I'll pay you tomorrow, Ross. Bye!
UNK: So they all took off. It was pretty hard watching them go, you know?
Carol : Yeah, okay. Bye.
UNK: So I'm gonna take off, then.
