Joey : Can I see the comics?
Chandler : This is the New York Times.
Joey : Okay, may I see the comics?
Monica : I thought you were taking Ross to the game.
UNK: - We are. He's meeting us here. - No, Rachel's meeting us here!
Phoebe : Come on! They can be in the same room.
UNK: - You should've been there last night. - What happened now?
UNK: Ross was hanging out at our place.
Joey : Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturizer from Chandler...
UNK: How hard is it to say "something"? Rachel came over to borrow "something."
Joey : Anyway, her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Phoebe : Why was he yelling at her?
UNK: He's the one who slept with someone else.
UNK: He says they were on a break when it happened...
UNK: ...so she should've forgiven him by now.
UNK: He is so unreasonable! God!
Phoebe : Although, I think I understand what he means.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! This is like 60 Minutes.
UNK: At first, you're really mad...
Phoebe : ...at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug.
UNK: And then, you just feel bad for the people...
Phoebe : ...because they needed to make their hair grow.
UNK: You know what this is like? It's like when my parents got divorced.
UNK: Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
UNK: I dreamed that Ross and Rachel were still together. They never broke up.
UNK: - We were all hanging out and happy. - I had the same dream.
UNK: - And nobody slept with the Xerox girl. - Oh, I had the opposite dream.
UNK: Maybe it's gonna be okay. I mean, it's been a week.
UNK: It never takes me more than a week to get over a relationship.
UNK: It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
UNK: Let's go! Let's hit the road. Let's get the show on it.
