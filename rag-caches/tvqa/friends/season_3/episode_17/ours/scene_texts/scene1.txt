UNK: Let me get coffee.
UNK: I know the best coffeehouse. And it's so close.
Rachel : - Closer than here? - Oh, look! I found coffee!
UNK: Okay, let's skedaddle.
UNK: Pheebs, I'm not gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Phoebe : Okay, Your Highness.
UNK: "Rachel, I'm really sorry." "Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"
UNK: "Yeah, okay."
Phoebe : Did anyone else hear that?
Joey : Are we talking models in their underwear?
Rachel : And heels.
Joey : Ross did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Rachel : Come on. If he asked you first, it's only fair.
Phoebe : - Boy, do I feel bad! - Oh, yeah.
Monica : Very bad.
Phoebe : - Chandler, what are you doing? - Chandler!
Phoebe : - Oh, my God! - You're smoking again?
Chandler : Well, actually, yesterday, I was smoking again.
UNK: Today, I'm smoking still.
Phoebe : Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Chandler : This is just like my parents' divorce...
Chandler : ...which is when I first started smoking.
UNK: Weren't you 9?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I'm telling you something, that first smoke after naptime...
UNK: That's great. With my luck, that's him.
Phoebe : Him? Ross?
UNK: No, Hymn 253 : "His Eyes Are on the Sparrow."
UNK: When my parents got divorced, I started using humor as a defense mechanism.
UNK: Hi. Do you guys have weekend plans?
UNK: Because my sister says we can spend the weekend at her cabin, skiing.
UNK: I'm asking you first, right? I'm playing by the rules.
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?
Chandler : Shut up! You're not my real mom!
UNK: Could you close that window? My nipples could cut glass over here.
Phoebe : Wait, really? Because mine get me out of tickets.
UNK: Look, I just wanna say I really appreciate you spending time with me.
UNK: It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
Chandler : Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
UNK: Hey, how about this weekend, we have a laser-disc marathon, okay?
Ross : And maybe a tournament on my new dartboard?
Ross : What do you think? Two days of darts! Lt'll be great!
UNK: - It'll be great for next weekend. - No, this weekend, guys.
UNK: It'll be great for next weekend.
UNK: I mean, "It'll be great."
UNK: What's going on?
UNK: We're sort of invited to go skiing. You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?
Ross : So, for the whole weekend?
