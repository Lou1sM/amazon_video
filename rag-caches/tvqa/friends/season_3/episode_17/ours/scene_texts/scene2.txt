UNK: We're really sorry, but she did ask us first.
UNK: That's okay. If you all have to go away...
Ross : ...for the first weekend I'm alone by myself...
Ross : ...then I totally, totally understand.
UNK: I can stay. I'm gonna stay. The last time I went skiing...
UNK: ...I was afraid to jump off the chair lift. I just went round and round.
UNK: We need you to drive us there in your grandmother's cab.
UNK: - But you know what? I'll stay. - No, I'll stay. He's my brother.
UNK: What, a "pity stay"?
UNK: We're gonna have fun!
Monica : We can make fudge.
UNK: "Pity food"?
UNK: You know what? I don't need any of you to stay.
Ross : Nobody stays.
Chandler : Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Joey : - Does anybody else feel bad about Ross? - You think he's still mad at us?
UNK: He's probably more mad since you called him to borrow his goggles.
UNK: What? Mine aren't tinted.
UNK: [scene : - Chandler! - What?
Phoebe : What does the sign say?
UNK: "Beam me up, Jesus."
UNK: The "No smoking" sign.
UNK: There's no smoking in my grandmother's cab.
UNK: Well, then, I have to go to the bathroom.
Ross : Oh, please!
Monica : No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
UNK: There's a rest stop right up there. Come on, I really have to go!
Joey : Oh, now I have to go!
UNK: Is that all that it takes?
UNK: Sometimes just a small breeze...
Chandler : Here we go.
UNK: - Brace yourself! - What?
UNK: - Aren't you gonna go? - No, thanks.
Monica : Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Rachel : They never have any paper in there. So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy."
UNK: Well, if everybody's going...
UNK: - Don't close it! The keys are in there! - Oh, no, no, no!
UNK: - What's going on? - My lighter's in there!
UNK: Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this.
UNK: Relax. I can open this. Anybody got a coat hanger?
Chandler : Oh, I do.
UNK: No, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
UNK: So if your parents hadn't divorced...
UNK: ...you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Joey : Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it.
UNK: One of you give me your bra underwire.
UNK: What?!
Phoebe : Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Joey : Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra and wire.
Monica : - No! - It's too expensive!
UNK: To get back in the car, we need that wire.
Joey : Your call.
UNK: Okay. Monica's are the biggest.
Monica : These tiny little non-breasts? Please! Gotta be Rachel.
UNK: What? No, mine are deceptively small.
UNK: I mean, I actually sometimes stuff my bra.
UNK: Well, then, your bra would still be big.
Rachel : No, I stuff outside the bra.
UNK: Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?
Chandler : Phoebe, Rachel, take off Monica's bra.
UNK: All right, forget it, never mind.
Phoebe : - You can have mine. - Thank you.
Phoebe : Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Chandler : I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Phoebe : Okay. There.
UNK: Wow. Thank you, Phoebe. That is very generous.
UNK: Wow. This is nice. Were you planning on meeting somebody up there?
UNK: Okay. Now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
Joey : And there you go!
UNK: Chandler.
UNK: Well, at least let me smoke it to the good part!
UNK: Okay.
Joey : Oh, no.
Phoebe : - What? - What? What's going on?
Phoebe : Yeah, this has happened before.
Rachel : - So you know how to fix it? - Yep. Put more gas in.
UNK: Hi. What are you doing here?
UNK: I was wondering, when you and I split up...
Ross : ...did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M.A.S. H...
Ross : ...and half the hostages coming home?
UNK: Yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
UNK: - Where's Ben? - He's sleeping.
Ross : - Is this a bad time? - Yeah, actually.
UNK: Susan's gonna be here any minute. It's kind of an anniversary.
Ross : I thought you guys got married in January.
UNK: - Different kind of anniversary. - Oh.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: So anyway...
Ross : Candles, champagne. Yeah, anniversaries are great...
UNK: ...because love lasts forever, you know?
Ross : Nothing like it in this lifetime. Money in the bank.
Ross : So Rachel and I broke up.
Carol : - God, Ross, I am so sorry. - Yeah.
UNK: You know what? I wanna talk about this so much...
