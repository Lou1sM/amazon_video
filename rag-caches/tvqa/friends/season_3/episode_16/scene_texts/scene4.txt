UNK: Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful.
UNK: Please, Ross, you've gotta know there's nothing between me and Mark.
Rachel : This whole breakup thing is just stupid.
UNK: I'm just so sorry I put you through it.
UNK: And I don't want to get back together over a machine.
Rachel : - So I love you. - I love you.
UNK: And you know what? I'm gonna go to bed now...
UNK: ...but on my way to work tomorrow, I'm gonna stop by around 8 : 30. Bye.
UNK: Chloe, how's it coming?
Chloe : What kind of puppy do you think I should get?
UNK: You know, I don't know. How about a big one?
UNK: - But my apartment's so... - Well, then a small one.
UNK: - Listen, we have to go. - Wait! Where's my shoes?
Ross : You sure you need shoes?
UNK: Do I know why we're rushing?
UNK: Yeah, you know the girlfriend I told you about?
UNK: Well, it turns out that she wants to get back together with me.
Ross : I found it!
UNK: That's so great for you guys!
Chloe : You must be so happy!
Ross : Yes, I am. One of the many things I'm feeling.
Chloe : - Good luck with your girlfriend. - Oh, thank you.
Rachel : - You got my message? - You are right on time!
Rachel : So, what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ross : Yes, you can. Very much.
Phoebe : - Why are you mopping your ceiling? - There's banana on it.
Phoebe : I have the spirit of an old Indian woman living in mine.
Monica : So then you know.
Phoebe : The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Monica : - Oh, good. Thanks. - Now, what is Fabutech?
UNK: All right, don't judge me too much, okay?
Monica : But I saw this infomercial, and I swear to you I have never, ever...
Monica : ...bought anything on TV before.
Monica : Except for this mop.
UNK: But there was this stuff on leg-waxing. It looked so amazing.
UNK: Waxine!
Monica : Yes! Have you seen it?
UNK: It's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine Girl!
Chloe : I know!
UNK: Do you think it really doesn't hurt? Because how can they do that?
Monica : Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest?
Phoebe : They have the best stuff in there.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel.
Joey : Which is probably what you should have done, huh?
Ross : You think?
UNK: God, I'm in hell. I mean, what am I gonna do?
UNK: Rachel's all like, "I love you," and "Let's work on this"...
Ross : ...and all I can think about...
UNK: ...is what is she gonna do when I tell her what I did?
UNK: Before we answer that, we should address the more important question :
Chandler : How dumb are you?
UNK: What? Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right?
