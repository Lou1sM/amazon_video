UNK: How was the big anniversary dinner?
Rachel : Well, we never actually got to dinner.
UNK: Nice.
UNK: No, we kind of broke up instead.
UNK: What?
UNK: My God, Monica! It's on the ceiling!
UNK: That's okay.
Monica : This is more important than fruit...
Monica : ...on my ceiling.
Monica : You broke up?
UNK: Yeah, but it's okay because when Ross left, Mark came over.
UNK: - Oh, no! You and Mark? - It's okay. Calm down.
Rachel : Mark and I talked...
UNK: ...and I realized how much I love your stupid brother, and...
Rachel : ...yeah, we got our problems, but I really wanna make it work.
