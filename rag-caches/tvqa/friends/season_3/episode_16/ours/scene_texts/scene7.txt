Ross : And all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment...
Rachel : Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute.
Rachel : What time did your little friend leave?
Rachel : Oh, my God. She was there? She was still there?
Rachel : She was in there when I was in there?
UNK: Listen, the important thing is, she meant nothing to me.
Rachel : And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!
UNK: I didn't think there was a relationship.
Ross : - I thought we were broken up. - We were on a break.
UNK: That, for all I knew, could last forever. That, to me, is a breakup.
UNK: You gonna get out of this on a technicality?
UNK: I'm not trying to "get out" of anything, okay?
Ross : I thought our relationship was dead.
Rachel : Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.
UNK: You know what? I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
Monica : What are you doing? We can't go out there.
UNK: Why not? I'm hungry.
UNK: Because they'll know we've been listening.
Rachel : God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!
Ross : Like I wanted him to tell you?
Ross : I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Rachel : Oh, that is so sweet.
UNK: I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
UNK: I think we can go out. They have more important things to worry about.
UNK: We'll be fine.
Ross : Look, Rachel, I wanted to tell you. I thought I should. I did.
Ross : And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to!
Chandler : Wax the door shut. We're never leaving.
UNK: Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen, someone has to take my 9 : 00 with Mr. Rehak...
UNK: ...because it's 9 : 15 now, and I'm not there.
UNK: No, I'm in the middle of a huge relationship fight, so...
UNK: Oh, that's all right. It's not mine.
UNK: Don't you realize none of this would ever have happened if I didn't think...
Ross : ...at that same moment you were having sex with Mark?
Monica : All right.
UNK: Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Ross : Yes, I would.
UNK: You'd be okay if you knew...
Rachel : ...that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me...
Rachel : ...and made love to me?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: If you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...
Chandler : Okay, okay. Yeah, I would have been devastated...
Ross : ...but I would still want to be with you.
UNK: Because, I mean, it's you.
UNK: What?
Ross : Come on, Rachel, tell me what you're thinking.
UNK: I'm thinking...
UNK: ...I'm gonna order a pizza.
Ross : Order a pizza, like...
UNK: ..."I forgive you"?
Joey : Oh, man!
UNK: Pizza?
Joey : I like pizza.
Joey : Put olives on the pizza.
UNK: We could eat the wax! It's organic!
Chandler : Oh, great. Food with hair on it.
Phoebe : No, not the used wax.
Chandler : Because that would be crazy?
UNK: Could I get in on that? Because I'm kind of hungry myself.
UNK: Fine.
UNK: Hi, yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
Ross : - No anchovies. - With extra anchovies.
UNK: That's okay. I'll pick them off.
Rachel : And could you please chop some up and just put it right in the sauce?
Ross : You can have the last piece if you want.
Rachel : Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
UNK: They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
UNK: Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.
