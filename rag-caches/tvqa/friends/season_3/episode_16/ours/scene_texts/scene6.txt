UNK: Okay, I got an idea. Why don't you pull off mine, and I pull off yours?
UNK: Or, you pull of yours, and I will leave mine on...
UNK: ...because I think I can make this look work.
UNK: Come on, Phoebe. We can do this.
Monica : - All right. - All right.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: - What is it? - What's going on?
UNK: - We're all right. - It's okay. It's okay.
Monica : - We were just waxing our legs. - Off?
Phoebe : For your information...
Phoebe : ...this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
UNK: I don't think you can make that statement unless you've been kicked...
UNK: ...in an area God only meant to be treated nicely.
UNK: I think women just have a lower threshold for pain than men, that's all.
Joey : I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah? Come here.
UNK: Oh, that's mature.
Joey : Okay, fine. So now what, I just pull it off?
UNK: That's right.
UNK: Okay, Tin Man.
Ross : Rachel, come on. Talk to me. Please!
Rachel : Talk to you? I can't even look at you right now.
UNK: What?
Chandler : Nothing. Nothing.
Monica : - Rachel said everything was okay. - What are they talking about?
Rachel : - Just get away from me! - I made a mistake, okay?
Rachel : A mistake? What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?
Phoebe : Where did he put it?
Rachel : Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Rachel : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : I knew something had to be wrong...
Phoebe : ...because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Chandler : Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...
Monica : You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?
Chandler : He has sex and we get hit in our heads!
Rachel : Know what? I want you to leave! Just get out! Now!
UNK: I want to stay. I want to talk about this.
Rachel : Okay. All right. How was she?
Mark : - What? - Was she good?
UNK: Don't answer that.
Rachel : You said you wanted to talk about it. Let's talk about it. How was she?
Ross : - She was... - Awful.
Chandler : - She was not good. - Horrible. Nothing compared to you.
Ross : She was different.
Rachel : Good different?
Ross : Nobody likes change.
UNK: - Just stop! - What? Okay! Okay! Okay!
Phoebe : Should we do something?
Chandler : Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.
UNK: I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I was disgusted with myself...
Ross : ...and this morning I was upset...
Ross : ...and then I got your message and I was so happy.
