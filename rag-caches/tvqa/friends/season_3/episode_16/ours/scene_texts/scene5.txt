Ross : How am I supposed to do that without being totally honest?
UNK: Ross, look, I'm onboard about the total-honesty thing. I am.
UNK: Just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
UNK: He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
UNK: Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
UNK: Don't you think...?
Chandler : Look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait till the timing's right.
UNK: And that's what deathbeds are for.
Ross : - Yeah, okay. - All right.
Joey : Okay. Now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.
Joey : Did you think about the trail?
Ross : What trail?
Joey : The trail from the woman you did it with...
Joey : ...to the woman you hope never finds out you did it!
Joey : You always have to think about the trail!
UNK: I don't think there's any trail.
UNK: Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.
UNK: Isaac's sister is Jasmine, and Jasmine works at the massage place with Phoebe.
UNK: And Phoebe's friends with Rachel, and that's the trail! I did it!
UNK: "After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one..."
Monica : - Did that! - Okay.
UNK: "Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy-grab tab...
Phoebe : ...and pull it off in one quick, pain-free motion."
UNK: Was it not "pain-free"?
Monica : No, it was pain-ful!
UNK: Oh, my God, they should call it "Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
Phoebe : The girls in the satin nighties on the commercial...
UNK: ...don't seem to think it's that bad.
UNK: That's because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.
UNK: But, hey, you know, if you don't believe me, please, be my guest.
Rachel : Oh, my God!
UNK: Now aren't you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Ross : Chloe, hi.
Chloe : Is this about me taking your watch?
Ross : - You took my watch? - I'm sorry. I do that.
Ross : You keep it. Listen, did you tell anyone about us?
UNK: Oh, no. I feel like it really isn't anybody's business, you know?
UNK: Exactly. So you didn't mention anything to Isaac, right?
UNK: - Oh, I tell Isaac everything. - You do? Of course you do.
UNK: Hi, Isaac. You know, we haven't actually met.
Issac : You dog!
Ross : Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.
Issac : Oh, right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
UNK: Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
UNK: Oh, hey, man, I know. It doesn't matter how much we love them.
Issac : Monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Ross : Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
UNK: Oh, no problem, dude. We gotta look out for each other.
UNK: We're the same, you and me.
UNK: Actually, no, we're not.
Issac : Yeah, we are.
UNK: No, we're not.
Issac : Yeah, we are.
UNK: No, we're not.
UNK: - Okay, we're not. - Right.
Issac : But we are.
Ross : Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Issac : I can promise not to tell her again.
UNK: Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.
Jasmine : You did a bad thing!
Ross : - Yes, I did. - Very bad!
Jasmine : - Very bad. - Very, very bad!
UNK: I'm agreeing with you.
Ross : Listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Ross : - No. - Okay, Jasmine...
UNK: ...please. Please don't.
Ross : I love my girlfriend very much...
Ross : ...and I want more than anything to just work it out with her, okay?
Monica : All right.
Ross : Thank you. Thank you.
Jasmine : But you should probably talk to my roommate.
Jasmine : I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.
UNK: Who's your roommate?
UNK: Gunther!
Ross : Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel...
Ross : ...about me and the girl from the copy place.
UNK: I'm sorry.
Gunther : Was I not supposed to?
