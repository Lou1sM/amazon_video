UNK: They've got to.
UNK: What if they don't?
Joey : You think I need a new walk?
UNK: What?
UNK: Well, you know, I've been walking the same way since high school.
UNK: You know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice?
UNK: I think I need a take-notice walk.
Chandler : Are you actually saying these words?
UNK: What, now you're not even talking to me?
UNK: Look, Rachel, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.
UNK: I thought I'd lost you.
Ross : How insane must I have been to do something like this?
UNK: I don't cheat, right? That's not me. I'm not Joey!
Ross : Yeah, okay.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: It's 3 in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet.
Monica : You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am?
UNK: Yeah, you know, people can be so self-involved.
UNK: You know what? I'm not the one that wanted that break, okay?
UNK: You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one...
UNK: ...that ran the moment things got a little rough.
UNK: - That's... - That's what?
Rachel : - That is neither here nor there. - Here we are...
Ross : ...in a tough spot again. What do you want?
Ross : How do you want to handle it? You want to fight for us or bail?
UNK: Look, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing, okay?
UNK: And I'm sorry. I wish I could take it back, but I can't.
UNK: I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.
Ross : Rachel, I love you so much.
UNK: No, Ross! Don't!
UNK: You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away.
UNK: It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better.
Chandler : Okay. Okay.
Rachel : I think you should go.
UNK: What?
Rachel : I really think you need to go now.
Chandler : Okay. Okay.
Ross : This morning you said there was nothing so big we couldn't work past it.
Rachel : What the hell did I know?
UNK: There's got to be a way we can work past this.
UNK: I can't imagine my life without you. You know? Without...
Ross : Without these arms...
UNK: ...and your face and heart...
UNK: ...your good heart, Rach, and...
UNK: No.
UNK: I can't. You're a totally different person to me now.
Rachel : I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me.
UNK: Ever.
UNK: God, and now I can't stop picturing you with her.
UNK: I can't. It doesn't matter what you say or what you do.
UNK: It's just changed everything.
UNK: Forever.
UNK: This can't be it.
Rachel : Then how come it is?
UNK: They've been quiet for a long time.
Joey : Maybe she killed him.
UNK: Let's go.
Chandler : Is that your new walk?
Joey : No. I really have to pee.
