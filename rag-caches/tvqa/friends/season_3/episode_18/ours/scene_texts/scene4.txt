UNK: I couldn't help it. Their love is so pure.
Phoebe : What about you, huh?
UNK: I'm the ring bearer.
UNK: I'm so glad you could come. I've got a real home-ec emergency.
Alice : - Oh, my God. Who died on this? - Yeah, I know.
UNK: It's a real "mustard-tastrophe."
Phoebe : Can you help?
UNK: Absolutely. First, we'll start with a little club soda and salt.
UNK: - Then if that doesn't work... - Forget it. It's ruined.
UNK: Never say that. If you can't get it out, cut around the stain...
Alice : ...add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Phoebe : Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank?
Pete : Can we make it smaller? Make it fit on the head of a pin?
Pete : I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
UNK: You have a Monica Geller here.
Pete : Absolutely. Yeah, send her in.
UNK: Hi.
Monica : What the hell is this?
UNK: Hang on for a sec. I'll talk to you in the morning?
UNK: You got it.
UNK: - I'm sorry. What? - What is this supposed to mean?
UNK: Well, you know, I never know how much to tip.
UNK: You double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania.
UNK: Are you buying me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
UNK: I'm still here.
UNK: You're taking this wrong. If I didn't leave you that tip...
UNK: ...you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument...
UNK: ...and there wouldn't be this heat between us.
Pete : You gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.
UNK: You were the chef and I was the customer.
UNK: But now we're, like, this couple that fights.
UNK: You're a loon.
Pete : Look, forget the check, okay? I like you.
UNK: I think you're great.
Pete : Come on, what do you say?
UNK: I don't know.
Pete : Why not?
UNK: Because I don't wanna encourage this kind of behavior.
Pete : One meal. That's all I'm asking for. Please?
Pete : We go out, we eat.
UNK: If you don't have a good time, I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.
Joey : - Hi. - No!
Frank : Wait, no. Just put the mail down. It's me.
Phoebe : Sorry. Why were you just, like, all in the dark?
UNK: Well, your laundry smelled so good that I thought I'd curl up in it.
Frank : - Is that all right? - Yeah, sure.
Phoebe : So how was your day?
Frank : Well, just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
Phoebe : What happened?
UNK: Alice... She called it off.
Joey : Oh, no.
