UNK: "Let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes." Remember?
UNK: And then you say, "Let's just hang out at your place."
UNK: Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.
Rachel : I think you should go out with this guy.
UNK: He doesn't do anything for me.
UNK: Last Saturday night, what happened on Walker, Texas Ranger?
UNK: Well, Walker was looking for this big busload of kids.
Monica : - All right, I get your point. - All right.
Joey : - Hi. - Hey.
Chandler : I forgot the combination to this about a year ago.
Chandler : I just carry it around.
UNK: - You got any Chap Stick? - Yeah.
Rachel : - How are those tapes working out? - Good. I haven't smoked yet today.
UNK: I feel great and confident. That is a stunning blouse.
Rachel : Thank you.
Ross : - Here you go. - Thanks.
UNK: Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance. He was funny. He seems really nice.
Rachel : That check thing was adorable.
Chandler : What check thing?
UNK: As a joke, this customer who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip.
UNK: His number's on the check. He did it so I'd call.
Chandler : Pete Becker. Pete...
Chandler : Is this him?
UNK: That's Bill Clinton.
UNK: Who's he hugging?
UNK: Oh, my God. That's Pete. Why is Bill hugging Pete?
Chandler : This guy invented Moss 865.
Chandler : Every office in the world uses that program.
Rachel : - We use it! - There you go!
UNK: Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
UNK: - I'm not gonna go out with him. - Why not? He's a millionaire.
UNK: Oh, my God. I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check. This is so exciting.
Monica : - Or incredibly offensive. - Yeah, sure. That too.
UNK: What?
UNK: All we're saying is, don't rush into anything.
Joey : Come on, think about it. You're 18, okay? She's 44.
UNK: When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
UNK: What? You don't think I know that?
UNK: All right, I'm gonna go play basketball.
UNK: Or let the really good guys use my ball...
UNK: ...while I say, "Can I play?"
UNK: Joe, you left your keys in the door.
Ross : Here you go.
Joey : The point is...
UNK: ...there's a lot of women you haven't had sex with yet.
UNK: He's right. He's right. This is your time.
UNK: You're young. You're weird. Chicks dig that.
UNK: Isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really care about?
Joey : Yeah, in a poem, maybe.
UNK: No, the man's right. That's what I had with Rachel.
UNK: - You don't have it anymore? - No. I slept with someone else.
UNK: So wait. So how did that make things better?
UNK: It didn't.
Frank : What you used to have with Rachel is what I got with Alice.
UNK: - Now, what is that like? - It's so cool, man.
UNK: It's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.
UNK: - Why can't I find that? - I had it and I blew it.
Joey : - Well, I want it! - You can have it.
UNK: Maybe there's something wrong with me.
UNK: No, it's out there, man. I've seen it! I got it!
Joey : - Then, you hold on to it! - All right, man!
Joey : All right! Congratulations, you lucky bastard!
UNK: You're Frank's best man?
