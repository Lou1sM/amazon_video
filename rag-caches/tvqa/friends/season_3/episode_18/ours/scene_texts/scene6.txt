UNK: You know...
Frank : ...I would storm out of here...
Frank : ...if I had some money or a place to go.
UNK: Ross, if you had a million dollars, what's the first thing you'd buy?
UNK: I'd get some municipal bonds, put the rest in the bank...
UNK: ...and live off the interest.
UNK: Well...
UNK: ...we've heard from Dr. Fun.
UNK: - Oh, my God! The millionaire's here! - Oh, my God!
UNK: I'm just gonna have dinner with him.
Chandler : Okay, just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.
Phoebe : I know.
Chandler : Okay, then get the lobster.
Ross : - Hey. - Hi.
Joey : - Hi. - Hey.
UNK: How much cash you got in your pocket now?
UNK: And that's why I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye.
UNK: Why not? Hey, come in for a drink.
UNK: - Where do you wanna go? - You like pizza?
UNK: - That sounds great. - I know a great little place.
UNK: You're not paying for the pizza.
UNK: Come on, it's only fair. You paid for the flight.
UNK: Is that enough lira?
UNK: I'd throw another 1000 on that.
Monica : - How much is that? - That's about 60 cents.
Joey : Every night!
UNK: You don't need to smoke.
UNK: Cigarettes don't control you.
UNK: Hypnosis Tape : You are a strong, confident woman...
UNK: Hypnosis Tape : ...who does not need to smoke.
UNK: Hypnosis Tape : A strong, confident woman...
UNK: Hypnosis Tape : ...who does not need to smoke.
UNK: So can I.
Phoebe : Hey, Frank.
UNK: Look, I know that you think I did this totally evil thing.
UNK: But I so didn't.
UNK: There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Phoebe : Hi, Frank.
Frank : Hi, Mrs. Knight.
UNK: Phoebe's right, Frank.
UNK: It's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.
Alice : I was being selfish.
UNK: Even though we want the same things right now...
Alice : ...in the future, we may not.
Alice : - Is that what it is? - Yes, but not just that.
Phoebe : Not just that.
Alice : Even though we love each other as much as we do...
UNK: ...nonetheless...
UNK: - Nonetheless. - Nonetheless.
UNK: You're too young...
Alice : ...to really know what you want.
UNK: That's right, exactly.
UNK: All right, that's a goodbye kiss. That's good.
UNK: Bye-bye.
UNK: But no, the important thing is, is that you see what I'm saying.
Phoebe : This is clearly wrong.
UNK: I've decided I'm gonna let this happen.
Phoebe : Okay, can I just get my purse? I'm sorry.
Phoebe : Okay, all right, good.
UNK: Cigarettes don't control you.
UNK: Hypnosis Tape : You are a strong, confident woman...
UNK: Hypnosis Tape : ...who does not need to smoke.
UNK: Joey's your best friend.
UNK: You wanna make him a cheese sandwich every day.
UNK: You wanna buy him hundreds of dollars' worth of pants.
