Phoebe : Did she say why?
UNK: No. Just that I was too young.
UNK: I don't see how I could suddenly be too young...
UNK: ...because I'm older than I was when we first got together.
UNK: Yeah, yeah. No. I don't...
UNK: I don't know. But you know what? Maybe it's just all for the best.
UNK: Well, yeah, if the best is, like, unbelievable pain.
Phoebe : Oh, sweetie.
UNK: You know, I was just finally happy.
Frank : For the first time in my life...
Frank : ...after my dad left me...
Frank : ...and then getting arrested for stealing those birds...
Frank : ...and then the whole punctured-lung thing.
UNK: It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather...
Frank : ...but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.
UNK: And now it's gone, and I don't know why.
Phoebe : Well, I can tell you why. It's because of me.
UNK: But you know what? I only did it because I love you, okay?
UNK: What?
UNK: I kind of had a little chat with Alice...
Phoebe : ...and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.
UNK: And you'll see it too, one day. You really, really will.
Frank : Wait a minute. This is because of you?
UNK: Okay...
UNK: My mother didn't want us to be together...
Frank : ...but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
UNK: You know, I came to you because I thought you'd understand. Oh, no!
