Chandler : Okay, Jerry. Thanks for stopping by.
Janice : - Hi. - Hey.
Monica : Oh, my God!
Chandler : Hey, Mon.
Monica : - Wanna hear something that sucks? - Do I ever!
UNK: - Chris says they're closing down the bar. - No way!
UNK: Apparently, they're turning it into a coffee place.
Chandler : Just coffee?
Chandler : - Where are we gonna hang out now? - You got me.
UNK: - Can I get a beer, please? - Hey, did you pick a roommate?
Chandler : - You betcha. - Is it the Italian guy?
Chandler : Yeah, right.
UNK: He's so cute.
UNK: That's what I want. A roommate I can walk around with...
Chandler : ...and be referred to as the funny one.
UNK: Pool table's free. Rack them up. Back in a minute.
Monica : Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Chandler : Okay, but after that, we're shooting some pool.
Rachel : No, no, no, no. Excuse me? Hello? Hi.
Rachel : My friend ordered an onion...
Rachel : ...not an olive.
Rachel : And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke...
UNK: ...which I don't think this is.
Waitress : - I am so sorry. - That's all right.
UNK: I mean, how hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
UNK: Friend No. 1 : I would like to propose a toast...
UNK: Friend No. 1 : ...to the woman who, in one year from today, will become...
UNK: ...Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.
UNK: I think it's time to see the ring again.
UNK: Isn't it exciting? I mean, it's like having a boyfriend for life.
Rachel : Yeah. I know.
UNK: What?
UNK: Oh, I don't know.
UNK: Well, maybe it's just the idea...
Rachel : ...of Barry for the rest of my life.
UNK: I don't know, I think I... I feel like I need to have one last fling...
UNK: ...you know, just to sort of get it out of my system.
UNK: Friend No. 1 : - Rachel, stop! - You're so bad!
UNK: I'm serious. I really think I need to just have...
UNK: ...some meaningless sex, you know?
UNK: With the next guy I see.
UNK: Excuse me, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Rachel : Yeah, so?
UNK: And now I've picked it up again.
Monica : My God! I went to high school with her.
UNK: Rachel!
UNK: Hi!
UNK: Monica!
UNK: Is she giving me the finger?
UNK: Monica!
UNK: Look! Hi! What do you think?
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: You can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Rachel : Yes, his name is Barry. He's a doctor, thank you very much.
Monica : Just like you always wanted. Congratulations.
UNK: Thank you. So how about you? Are you seeing anybody?
Monica : Not right now.
UNK: Oh, well, that's okay.
Rachel : I know.
UNK: So I think I'll get back to my friend.
Rachel : Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
Rachel : Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
UNK: That'd be great.
Joey : - Okay. - Thanks.
Monica : - Bye. - Bye.
Monica : Ten bucks says I never see that woman again in my life.
UNK: No, honey, really. It's fine.
UNK: Just...
Ross : Go with Susan.
Rachel : Really, I think...
Ross : I think girls' night out is a great idea.
Ross : Okay. Okay. Bye.
Phoebe : - So, what are they doing? - I don't know. Something girly.
UNK: Hey, you're early.
Monica : What are you doing with the lamp?
UNK: I'm just taking it to get rewired.
