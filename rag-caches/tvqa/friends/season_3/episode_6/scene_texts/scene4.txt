UNK: Mr. Heckles : Who are you?
UNK: I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
UNK: I'm Chandler's new roommate.
UNK: - I don't think so. - I could be Chandler's new roommate.
Eric : - But he told me over the phone... - He told me in person.
UNK: That's weird.
UNK: Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now.
Monica : Hi, again.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Thank you so much.
UNK: No, no, no. Don't thank me. Thank the jerk that didn't show up.
UNK: Okay, I gotta get to work.
UNK: And not just for the money. But because every now and then...
UNK: ...someone walks out of the bathroom with a little bit of toilet paper on their shoe.
UNK: - You need some help with that? - No, thanks. I got it.
UNK: No. No, I don't!
UNK: Okay?
UNK: Stood up too fast. Got a little head rush.
UNK: It's the heat.
Monica : And the humidity.
UNK: That's a...
UNK: That's a tough combination.
UNK: Do you want to come in for some lemonade?
UNK: Like you wouldn't believe.
Joey : This is a great place.
Rachel : Thank you.
Monica : Just make yourself comfortable.
UNK: Gotcha.
UNK: So this place is really my grandmother's.
Monica : I got it from her when she moved to Florida.
Monica : Otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
Monica : So if the landlord ever asks...
UNK: ...I'm an 87-year-old woman who's afraid of her VCR. You thirsty?
Joey : You bet I am!
UNK: Okay...
UNK: ...here's your penis!
Monica : Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing?
UNK: You said, "You wanna come in for some lemonade?"
UNK: So?
UNK: Were you just gonna give me lemonade?
Monica : Cover yourself up!
UNK: Oh, right. Sorry.
UNK: God, I don't believe this!
Monica : Someone asks you in for lemonade and to you that means they want to have sex?
UNK: Usually, yeah. Well, not just lemonade.
Joey : Iced tea, sometimes juice.
UNK: Look, sorry. I just...
Joey : I thought you liked me.
UNK: I'm such a jerk.
UNK: It's okay.
Monica : I suppose it could happen to anyone.
Monica : Not anyone I know, but...
Monica : By the way, I can still see it.
