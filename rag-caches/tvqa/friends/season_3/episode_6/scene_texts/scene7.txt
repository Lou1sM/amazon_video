Monica : You okay?
Monica : Phoebe moved out.
UNK: Right.
UNK: I don't understand.
UNK: Am I so hard to live with? Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
UNK: No!
UNK: You don't have a boyfriend because...
UNK: I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.
Chandler : You should have a boyfriend.
Monica : Well, I think so.
Chandler : Come here.
Chandler : Come here.
Chandler : Listen, you are one of my favorite people...
Chandler : ...and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
UNK: Hi.
Ross : Where is everybody?
UNK: Oh, it's already closed. Chris gave me the keys to lock up. What is wrong?
Ross : I think my marriage...
UNK: ...is kind of over.
Phoebe : Oh, no! Why?
UNK: Because Carol's a lesbian.
UNK: And...
UNK: And I'm not one.
UNK: And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: I don't believe it!
Phoebe : Oh, you poor bunny.
UNK: I'm an idiot.
UNK: I mean, I should have seen it.
UNK: I mean, Carol and I would be out, and she'd see some beautiful woman...
UNK: ...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"
UNK: And I'd think, "God, my wife is cool."
Phoebe : Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Ross : Well, now I do!
UNK: I'm sorry.
Ross : Seven years!
UNK: I mean, we've been together seven years.
UNK: She's the only woman who's ever loved me.
UNK: She's the only woman I've ever...
Phoebe : Oh, Ross.
Chandler : This is nice.
UNK: I know. It is, isn't it?
Chandler : No, I mean it. This feels really good.
Chandler : Is it a hundred percent cotton?
UNK: Yeah. And I got it on sale too.
UNK: I mean, it looks nubby, but...
UNK: But it's not.
Chandler : Anyway, I should go.
Chandler : One of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
UNK: If you want to get a drink later, we can.
Chandler : That sounds great.
UNK: - Oh, and listen, it's gonna be... - I know.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Maybe this wouldn't have happened if I'd been more nurturing...
UNK: ...or I'd paid more attention...
Ross : ...or I had a uterus.
UNK: - I can't believe it. - I know.
UNK: You know, you don't deserve this. You don't, Ross. You're really...
UNK: - You're so good. - Thanks.
UNK: And you're so sweet.
Chandler : - Thanks. - And you're kind.
UNK: Thanks.
Chandler : Come here.
Ross : Wait, wait, wait.
UNK: Okay. It's okay.
Ross : Wait, wait, wait! My foot is stuck in the pocket.
UNK: What?
UNK: Monica And Rachel : - What? - I can't get it out.
UNK: That's not something a girl wants to hear.
UNK: Come on, don't start.
UNK: Monica And Rachel : - What? - Stupid balls are in the way.
Monica : Oh, well.
UNK: That probably wouldn't have been the most constructive solution.
Phoebe : You have chalk on your face.
UNK: Oh, Ross, you're right. I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
UNK: Honey, you okay?
UNK: My wife's a lesbian.
UNK: Cool!
UNK: Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.
Joey : - Hey. - How's it going?
UNK: I can't believe you came back.
UNK: Don't say anything.
UNK: I don't wanna speak. I don't wanna think.
Rachel : I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here...
Monica : ...right now.
UNK: Rachel.
UNK: Rachel!
UNK: Monica And Rachel : - What? - You missed the exit.
Rachel : - Oh. Sorry. - My God, what were you thinking about?
UNK: Barry.
