Monica : - Pheebs? - Huh?
UNK: Where's your bed?
UNK: It's not in the apartment?
Rachel : Oh, no.
UNK: I can't believe this is happening again.
UNK: Monica And Rachel : - What? - Okay, enough with the third degree!
UNK: I don't live here anymore.
Monica : - What are you talking about? - I'm sorry.
UNK: I don't live here anymore.
UNK: I didn't know how to tell you. But, you know, everybody else knows.
Monica : Everybody knows?
Phoebe : That was supposed to be a good thing. I forget why.
UNK: I don't understand. I thought we were doing better lately.
UNK: Yeah, 'cause I moved out.
UNK: [scene : Monica, I...
UNK: Do you know, okay, I couldn't sleep for, like, a month...
UNK: ...because I got a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions?
UNK: Well, you could've just turned the cushion over.
UNK: I would have, except I had a spaghetti stain on the other side.
UNK: What?
UNK: Okay. This is what I'm talking about.
Phoebe : I need to live in a land where people can spill!
UNK: Well, you can spill.
Monica : In the sink.
UNK: Oh, honey. It's not your fault, you know. This is who you are.
Phoebe : And I love you. And I want us to be friends.
Phoebe : And if I keep living here, I don't see that happening.
Monica : - I love you too. - Oh, good.
UNK: What?
UNK: What? I'm just sad.
UNK: No, you're not. You're wondering which cushion it is.
UNK: Well, why can't I think of both? I mean, I can think two things.
UNK: Go ahead. Look. You know you want to. Go.
Monica : Oh, my God!
UNK: - So, what are you watching? - Baywatch.
UNK: What's it about?
UNK: Lifeguards.
UNK: Well, it sounds kind of stup...
UNK: Who's she?
Joey : Nicole Eggert.
UNK: We like her.
Chandler : Wow! Look at them run!
