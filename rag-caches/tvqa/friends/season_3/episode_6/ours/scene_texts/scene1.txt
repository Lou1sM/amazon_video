UNK: What else?
Eric : During the summer I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house...
Eric : ...which you are welcome to use.

UNK: Well, listen, I still have one more person to meet...
Chandler : ...but unless it turns out to be your sister...
UNK: ...I think your chances are pretty good.
Chandler : All right.
Chandler : Bedroom, bathroom, living room.
Chandler : This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.
UNK: Don't you wanna ask me any questions?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: Well, I'm an actor.
UNK: I'm fairly neat.
Joey : I got my own TV.
UNK: Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
Chandler : What gay thing?
UNK: Just, you know, in general. The whole people being gay thing.
Joey : Totally cool with that.
