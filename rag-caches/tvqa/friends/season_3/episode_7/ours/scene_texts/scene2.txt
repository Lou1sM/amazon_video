Ross : It was a joke. I made a joke.
Rachel : Actually, Daddy, Ross is allergic to lobster.
UNK: What kind of person's allergic to lobster?
UNK: Dr. Green : I guess the kind of person that works in a library.
UNK: - It's not... - I know. It's a museum!
UNK: You're the only who can make a joke? At least mine was funny.
UNK: Waiter.
UNK: Dr. Green : We will have two lobsters and a menu.
UNK: So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?
UNK: They found rust. Do you know what rust does to a boat?
Ross : Gives it a nice antique-y look?
UNK: Dr. Green : Rust is boat cancer, Ross.
UNK: Wow, I'm sorry.
Ross : When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.
UNK: Dr. Green : Excuse me for a moment, will you?
UNK: I wanna say good night to the Levines before we go.
UNK: Honey, stop. It's not that bad.
UNK: Your dad must have added wrong. He only tipped like 4%.
UNK: Yeah. That's Daddy.
UNK: "That's Daddy"? Doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Rachel : Yes, it bothers me.
Rachel : If he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
Ross : - So? - So, Ross...
UNK: ...I've bugged him about this a million times. He won't change.
UNK: Do you really serve people sneezers?
UNK: Well, I don't.
UNK: All right, kids. Ready?
UNK: Thanks again, Dr. Greene.
UNK: Dr. Green : Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
