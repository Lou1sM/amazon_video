UNK: Dr. Green : What is this?
UNK: Who put a 20 down here? Huh?
Ross : Oh, yeah, that would be me.
Ross : I have a problem. I tip way too much. Way too much.
UNK: - It's a sickness, really. - Yeah, it is.
UNK: - We have to do something about that. - Excuse me.
UNK: You think I'm cheap?
UNK: He didn't mean anything by that. He really didn't.
Ross : Nothing I do means anything. Really.

UNK: You put down $20 and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot.
UNK: Dr. Green : You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here. I'll tell you what :
