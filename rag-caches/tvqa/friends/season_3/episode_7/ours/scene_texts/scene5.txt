Rachel : Tonight was about the two of you getting along.
Rachel : Would you just see my chiropractor already?
UNK: I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to medical school in a mini-mall.
Ross : Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?
UNK: I'm freaking out!
UNK: Monica trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!
UNK: I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you.
UNK: Does Monica still turn the lights on in her bedroom?
UNK: I am so dead!
UNK: Look, here's the bottom line. This is fixable if we act fast, okay?
UNK: I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow, and you can make nice.
Ross : Honey, I have tried to make nice. It doesn't work.
UNK: Look, I realize my father is difficult.
UNK: But that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Ross : Sweetie, I could be the bigger man. I could be the biggest man.
Ross : I could be a big, huge, giant man, it still wouldn't make a difference.
UNK: Except I could pick your father up and say, "Like me! Like me, tiny doctor!"
UNK: Can't you just try it one more time? For me? For me?
Ross : One brunch is not gonna solve anything.
Ross : Face it. We're never gonna get along.
UNK: Well, you are just going to have to.
UNK: I've already got a mother and father who cannot stay in the same room.
UNK: I don't want to have a separate room for you too!
UNK: I'll get the bagels.
UNK: What's this?
UNK: Isn't it cool?
Monica : - This is not the bed I ordered. - I know!
UNK: You must have won, like, a contest or something.
Monica : Why is this car in my bedroom?
UNK: I'm sorry. I wasn't looking...
UNK: ...and the store won't take it back because you signed for it.
Monica : - When did I sign for it? - When I was you.
UNK: It's all Joey's fault, because he left his nose open!
Monica : Did you make brownies today?
Chandler : - Knock, knock! - Quick!
Monica : Take off your dress. He won't notice the bed.
UNK: I'm going for sushi. Does anybody want...?
UNK: Somebody missed the off-ramp!
UNK: - It's Monica's bed. What? - Okay.
UNK: It's a racecar!
UNK: This has always been Monica's bed. You just noticed?
Phoebe : How self-involved are you?
UNK: If this bed isn't new, then how come there's plastic on the mattress?
Monica : Sometimes I have bad dreams.
UNK: Look...
Student : ...I just saw my best friend's brain smeared across the canvas.
UNK: It's not gonna be me.
Joey : Not me.
Joey : That was good.
Joey : That was...
Joey : - Tweezers? - No.
Joey : - That was really good. - Thanks.
Student : Any suggestions?
Chandler : You told him to play the boxer gay?
UNK: Well, I might have said :
UNK: "Super-gay."
UNK: Joey, the last time an actor did something this bad, a president died.
UNK: Lincoln. Booth.
UNK: Something happened at the tunnel?
UNK: You're this guy's teacher. How could you do this?
UNK: Because, Monica, the guy's so good. And I really, really want this part.
Phoebe : Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
Rachel : - Hi, Daddy. - Baby.
UNK: [scene : - Ross. - Dr. Greene, how are you?
UNK: Dr. Green : Thanks for dinner last night.
Ross : Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
UNK: Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?
UNK: That's it. I can't take it anymore.
UNK: What? He's interested in you. He likes your hair.
Rachel : - He just wants to know how you got here. - Oh, please.
UNK: - It's hopeless. I'm just gonna go. - What? Ross...
