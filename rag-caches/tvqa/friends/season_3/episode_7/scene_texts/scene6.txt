UNK: - I'm sorry. It's just... - Ross?
UNK: What's with the neck?
UNK: He has this thing. I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor.
UNK: You still going to him?
UNK: That man couldn't get into med school in Ixtapa!
Rachel : Thank you. That's what I keep saying.
Rachel : Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
UNK: Dr. Green : Wait a minute. His name is Dr. Bobby?
UNK: - That's his last name. - And his first name.
UNK: He's Bobby Bobby?
UNK: It's Robert Bobby.
Rachel : And excuse me, he helps me.
Ross : - Please. Ask her how. - What do you need help for?
Rachel : My alignment. One leg's shorter than the other.
Phoebe : - Oh, my God. - Argue with that.
UNK: It's true! My right leg is two inches shorter!
UNK: Come on, you're just tilting!
UNK: Dr. Green : - Her legs are fine. - I know that.
UNK: - So why do you let her go to him? - "Let her"?
UNK: She doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
UNK: Dr. Green : Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?
UNK: What if you're robbed?
UNK: How will you run after the robber with one leg shorter than the other?
Ross : - Would you like some juice? - I'd love some juice.
Ross : This is going so well! Did you see us? Did you see?
Rachel : Yeah, honey. I was standing right there.
UNK: Why don't you tell him about the mole I haven't checked yet?
UNK: Excellent!
Joey : There will come a time in each of your careers...
UNK: ...when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
Joey : I had such an opportunity in the recent present.
UNK: And I'm ashamed to say...
Joey : ...that I took it.
Joey : I advised a fellow actor to play a role...
UNK: ...homosexually.
Joey : We both auditioned for the part...
Joey : ...and as it turned out...
UNK: ...they...
Joey : They liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
Joey : And now...
UNK: ...he's got a two-year contract opposite...
UNK: ...Susan Lucci...
Joey : ...the first lady of daytime television.
Joey : And me?
UNK: Me, I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people...
Joey : ...most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.
UNK: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Rachel : Thank you.
Jester : - May I help you? - Yes, hi.
UNK: We spoke earlier. I'm the lady stuck with the racecar bed.
UNK: Look, it's like I told you. There's nothing I can do.
Phoebe : You signed for it. "Monica Felula Geller."
Joey : All right, jester man, we wanna see the King.
Jester : Nobody sees the King.
UNK: - Okay. I'm talking to the King. - Hey, you can't go back there!
Phoebe : Oh, my God.
Chandler : Watch it, lady!
UNK: Hey, good-looking.
UNK: All right, I'll leave.
UNK: My bed's so boring.
