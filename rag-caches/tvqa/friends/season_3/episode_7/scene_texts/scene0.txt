UNK: So I told Carl, nobody, no matter how famous their parents are...
Ross : ...is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.
Ross : But, of course, it went right in one ear...
Rachel : I love how he cares so much about stuff.
Rachel : If I squint, I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Monica : Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.
Monica : When are those gonna become extinct?
Chandler : If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible...
Chandler : ...that would be the best.
Gunther : What does Rachel see in this guy?
Gunther : I love Rachel.
Gunther : I wish she was my wife.
UNK: Who's singing?
Ross : When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days...
Ross : ...who were you? I was Richie.
UNK: I was always Joanie.
Question : Was "Egg the Gellers!" The war cry of your neighborhood?
UNK: - It's the Mattress King! - Don't look, honey. Change the channel!
Janice : Wait! I wanna see this! After I divorce him...
Janice : ...half of that kingdom is gonna be mine!
UNK: Despair fills the mattress show room.
UNK: Matress King : My kingdom is suddenly without a queen.
UNK: I'm so depressed...
UNK: ...I'm going to slash...
UNK: Matress King : ...my prices!
UNK: Matress King : Check it out! 599 for a California king!
UNK: 499 for a pillow-top queen set!
UNK: I'm going medieval on prices!
Chandler : What a wank!
UNK: I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses!
UNK: I know. At 499 for a pillow-top queen, who cares about the divorce?
Monica : Those babies will sell themselves!
UNK: And I'm appalled for you, by the way.
UNK: I'm close! I'm cheap! I'm the King!
UNK: He stuffs that codpiece, right?
Ross : Oh, yeah.
UNK: Okay, here you go.
UNK: Dr. Green : You know what? I asked for no cinnamon on top.
UNK: Okay, Daddy. We'll see you tomorrow night. Okay, bye.
UNK: "We"?
UNK: - Are having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.
Ross : Oh, shoot! Tomorrow's not good.
UNK: I'm supposed to fall off the Empire State Building...
Ross : ...and land on a bicycle with no seat, so...
UNK: Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
UNK: Please. He refers to me as "Wet-Head."
Rachel : Honey, he calls everybody by a nickname.
UNK: I know. Just one dinner. One night. For me. Please?
Rachel : I just want him to love you like I do.
Rachel : All right. Well, not exactly like I do.
Rachel : But if you do come to dinner...
UNK: ...I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
UNK: Dr. Green : I'll go.
Ross : - Fine. - Thank you.
Ross : Hi, Gunther.
UNK: Yeah. We'll see.
Joey : Hey, you guys!
Joey : - Guess what. - What?
Joey : - I got a gig! - Great!
UNK: See, that's why I could never be an actor. I can't say "gig."
UNK: I can't say "croissant." Oh, my God!
UNK: - What's the part? - It's not a part.
UNK: I'm teaching Acting for Soap Operas at the Learning Extension.
UNK: Come on! That's great!
UNK: It's, like, my chance to give something back...
Joey : ...to the acting community.
UNK: You're probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Monica : I know.
UNK: I don't know, Monica. It feels funny just being here.
Phoebe : I mean, if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband...
UNK: ...that's like betraying Chandler.
Monica : Not at these prices!
UNK: You know, in England this car would be on the other side of the store.
Monica : Phoebe. Come here.
