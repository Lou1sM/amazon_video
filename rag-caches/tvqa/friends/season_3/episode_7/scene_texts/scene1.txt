Monica : This is my new bed!
Monica : You gotta feel this bad boy!
UNK: Monica, it still feels so weird, you know?
UNK: Chandler's your friend.
Phoebe : Oh, my God!
Phoebe : All right, take this bed. You can make other friends.
Joey : Good evening.
UNK: I am Mr. Tribbiani.
Joey : And I'll be teaching Acting for Soap Operas.
UNK: Unfortunately, tonight will be my only class...
UNK: ...because due to a rare blood disease I only have two weeks to live.
UNK: So do we get our deposit back?
UNK: That was supposed to be an example of acting for soap operas.
UNK: Then why are you only teaching tonight?
UNK: I'm not. Look, why don't we get straight to the lesson, okay?
UNK: Now...
UNK: ...on my first day as Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives...
UNK: ...I learned one of the most important things in soap opera acting...
Joey : ...is reacting.
Joey : This does not mean acting again.
UNK: It means you don't have a line, but someone else just did.
UNK: And it goes something like this :
Joey : Thanks. Thanks a lot.
UNK: By the way, before I forget : To work in soap operas...
UNK: ...some of you are gonna have to become much more attractive.
Joey : All right, moving right along...
Phoebe : - How was teaching last night? - Great! You get to say stuff like :
UNK: "Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you. I dismiss you."
Phoebe : Oh, nice.
Joey : Guess what? I got an audition for All My Children!
UNK: It's this great part. This boxer named Nick.
UNK: And I'm so, so right for it. He's just like me.
UNK: Except that he's a boxer...
Joey : ...and has an evil twin.
UNK: Hear ye, hear ye! Delivery from the Mattress King!
Guy : - You Miss Geller? - Okay.
Guy : Sign here.
Phoebe : Do I have a middle name?
UNK: All right. Monica "Felula"...
UNK: ...Geller.
UNK: It's that bedroom there.
Joey : Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Phoebe : So please, please, please don't say anything to Chandler.
UNK: - You want me to lie to him? - Is that a problem?
UNK: Oh, hey, "Nick the boxer." Let's see what you got!
UNK: - All right, put them up. Come on. - Hey, you're pretty good at this.
Phoebe : I had to learn. I was staying at the Y...
UNK: ...and some of the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Joey : Hey, now!
UNK: And I'm bleeding. Okay, great.
UNK: Wow! And I'm a vegetarian!
UNK: I'm sorry. We'll put some ice on it.
Phoebe : - Put your head back. - All right.
UNK: - I can't see. - I have you.
Phoebe : Oh, God!
UNK: Which bedroom do you want it in, Ms. Geller?
UNK: It's the compulsively neat one by the window.
UNK: Gotcha.
Rachel : Hi, Daddy!
UNK: This is where they put us?
UNK: What, there was no table available in the kitchen?
UNK: Dr. Green : - Hello, baby. - You remember Ross.
UNK: Nice to see you again, Dr. Greene.
UNK: So...
UNK: - How's the library? - Museum.
UNK: Dr. Green : - What happened to the library? - There never was a library.
Ross : I mean, there are libraries. It's just...
UNK: ...that I've never worked at one.
UNK: You know what's really good here? The lobster.
UNK: - What do you say? Shall I order three? - Lf you're really hungry.
