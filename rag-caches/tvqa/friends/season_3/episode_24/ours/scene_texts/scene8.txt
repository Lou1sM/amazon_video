UNK: They're interviewing his opponent.
Monica : Apparently, he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
UNK: [scene : - Hot dog? - Four, please.
UNK: I'm really nervous.
Ross : Thank you.
UNK: So, Ross, how did it go with Bonnie?
Ross : Oh, I gotta tell you, I wasn't expecting to like her at all.
UNK: I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now.
UNK: But she's really terrific.
UNK: It's too bad.
UNK: No, I'm saying I liked her.
Phoebe : There are other fish in the sea.
UNK: I think she's great, okay? We're going out again.
Phoebe : I hear you. Are you capable of talking about anything else?
UNK: Which one's my turkey burger?
Ross : The one next to my foot. Sorry.
UNK: - Fight's starting! - We'll be right in.
UNK: So did your boss try to slap you again today?
Chandler : Nine times.
Chandler : I had to put on lotion.
UNK: But it'll be okay. Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.
Chandler : And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack-free.
UNK: Fight's over!
Chandler : Excuse me, Doug?
Chandler : Hey there, sports fan!
Doug : Bing! You got those numbers for me?
