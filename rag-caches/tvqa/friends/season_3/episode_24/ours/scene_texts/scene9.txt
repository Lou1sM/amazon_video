UNK: Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.
UNK: That's okay. You're still my number-one guy! Bing!
UNK: Doug!

UNK: Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the sentiment.
UNK: It's just that I have a rather sensitive posterior.
UNK: And besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.

UNK: Bing, you're okay.

Phoebe : ...or inside his shower drain?
