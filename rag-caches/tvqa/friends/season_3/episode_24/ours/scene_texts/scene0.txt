UNK: Do you think there's a town in Missouri or someplace...
Chandler : ...called Sample?
UNK: And as you're driving into the town, there's a sign and it says :
UNK: "You're in Sample."
UNK: - How did it go with Pete? - Tell us.
UNK: You're not gonna believe this. So I go...
UNK: I'm sorry. Excuse us.
UNK: - It's a little crowded. Do you mind? - Could you scooch?
Billy : Move over just a little bit.
Robin : Keep on scooching.
Monica : So, guys, listen. I go over there and, you know, I'm...
UNK: Why? What is wrong with me?
UNK: - What's the matter? - Tim...
UNK: ...I have a feeling...
Robin : ...my wife is sleeping with her gynecologist.
Billy : How do you know?
UNK: - He's got access. - I know.
UNK: It's a feeling you get.
UNK: Like when you're in somebody else's bowling shoes?
UNK: That's the one.
UNK: - So you went to Pete's. - What happened?
Robin : Why is this happening to me?
UNK: Maybe it's my wound.
Monica : Forget it.
UNK: It's not healed yet?
UNK: It's oozing!
UNK: Would you pass the cream? There's the cream.
UNK: Thank you very much.
UNK: Tomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me.
Robin : - What is it? - I've been sleeping with your wife.
UNK: You're the gynecologist?
UNK: I'm trying to have a private conversation.
Robin : Can I have a napkin? Could you please hand me a napkin?
UNK: Just give me the thing, all right?
UNK: Enough! And you are no longer my friend!
UNK: We are finished! Nada! No more!
UNK: You are a bastard for doing that!
UNK: Stay away from me!
Billy : Come back!
UNK: So, what were you gonna tell us?
Monica : I have no idea.
Rachel : What was the big news Pete wanted to tell you?
UNK: Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?
Phoebe : Oh, keep your name. Don't take his name.
UNK: He didn't ask me to marry him.
UNK: Then definitely don't take his name!
UNK: He wanted to tell me he's going to compete in some Ultimate...
Monica : ...Fighting Competition thingy.
Rachel : - Pete? - Why? What is it?
UNK: I don't know exactly. It's sort of like wrestling.
Monica : But without the costumes.
UNK: And it's not fake. It's totally brutal.
UNK: It's two guys in the ring and the rules are, "There are no rules"!
UNK: - I heard you made a great 12-year-old. - It was the best year of my life.
UNK: You can bite and pull people's hair and stuff?
UNK: Anything goes except eye-gouging and fish-hooking.
UNK: - What's fish-hooking? - What's fish-hook...?
UNK: Thanks. That would have been hard to describe.
Ross : What is that taste?
Joey : My hands are totally clean. I just gave the duck a bath.
