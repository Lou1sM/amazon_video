Rachel : Oh, my God.
UNK: Look. It's Ross and that girl.
UNK: Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
UNK: Right. Oh, yeah. It looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
Phoebe : I hope he lets her down easy.
Rachel : Look at that! They are not breaking up! Look at them!
Rachel : You know what that is? A second date, that's what that is.
UNK: Look, she just put her hand on his thigh.
UNK: That's nothing. She's very sexually aggressive.
UNK: Oh, God!
UNK: It's your fault. Now he loves her. He'll marry her. It's all your fault.
Phoebe : You said it was okay.
Rachel : You said she was bald!
UNK: Was! Was, was, was!
