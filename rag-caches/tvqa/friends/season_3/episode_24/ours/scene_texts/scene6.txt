UNK: Who else would it be?
UNK: Earlier, when you were coming to, you called me Fran.
Monica : Can I just tell you how proud I am of you?
Pete : It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant, "You suck!"
Monica : I thought you were nuts at first...
UNK: ...but you did it.
Monica : Now you can just look back at this with no regrets.
Monica : Look back?
UNK: You're not gonna keep going?
UNK: Let me ask you a question : Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Monica : Well, no. But...
UNK: I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
