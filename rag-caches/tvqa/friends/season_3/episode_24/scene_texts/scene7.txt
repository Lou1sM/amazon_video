Monica : That guy stood on your neck until you passed out.
Pete : Let me tell you a story.
Pete : When I set out to create MOSS 865, do you think it happened overnight?
Pete : No. There was MOSS 1 that burned down my dad's garage.
Pete : There was MOSS 2 that would only schedule appointments in January.
Pete : And 862 others that I learned from.
Pete : Just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
UNK: You didn't know that already?
UNK: Look, I'm gonna get better.
Pete : Okay? I promise you.
Monica : Just get a lot better.
UNK: Fast.
Pete : One other thing.
UNK: Hoshi thinks you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
UNK: Yeah.
Monica : That was the problem.
UNK: - How long until Pete's fight? - About five minutes.
