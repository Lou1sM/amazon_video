Rachel : You said she was bald.
UNK: She was bald. She's not now.
Rachel : How could you not tell me she has hair?
UNK: I don't know. I hardly ever say that about people.
UNK: Oh, well, this is just perfect!
UNK: Well, I'm sorry. I thought you said it was okay.
UNK: I said it was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.
UNK: That girl has got hair all over her head!
UNK: - Maybe Ross won't like her personality. - Does she have a bad personality?
UNK: Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!
