Doug : Thanks for the warm welcome.
UNK: It's good to have you guys on my team. I come to play. I hope you do too.
UNK: Let's go out there and get them! And remember :
UNK: There is no I in "team."
UNK: Yes, but there's two in "martini." So, everybody, back to my office.
UNK: You! Chuckles. What's your name?
UNK: It's Bing, sir. I'm sorry. I was just...
UNK: No, no. I heard what you said. Funny. I like funny.
UNK: This team's about hard work, but it's also about having fun.
Doug : Good to have you aboard, Bing!
UNK: That's right. Ryder.
UNK: Winona Ryder for six.
Ross : Thank you.
Ross : Yeah. We have the reservations.
Chandler : All right, buddy! Way to go!
Ross : Dude, what are you doing?
UNK: Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my butt and acting like it's no big deal.
UNK: What'd you do about it?
UNK: I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy...
Chandler : ...who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
UNK: I gotta tell you, I think it's okay to be that guy.
UNK: Maybe it's that jock thing.
UNK: You know, how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
UNK: You know, I don't understand guys.
UNK: I mean, I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew...
UNK: ...by, you know, grabbing her boob.
Chandler : I know. For a really great stew, you'd just...
UNK: ...stick your head in between them.
Monica : Can we please go eat?
Joey : - Yeah, what are we getting? - Anything but stew.
UNK: So from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you.
UNK: Don't turn your back to him.
UNK: Or you could teach him a lesson, you know?
UNK: What you do is rub something that smells really bad on your butt, right?
UNK: Then, when he goes to smack you, his hand will smell.
Joey : Now, what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
UNK: What if Joey was president?
Phoebe : Can I ask you something?
Phoebe : Okay, you can totally say no...
UNK: ...but would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Rachel : With who?
Phoebe : My friend Bonnie. She always thought Ross was cute...
UNK: ...and she asked if I could set it up.
UNK: - But if that's not cool... - Which one is Bonnie?
Phoebe : You remember her from my birthday party?
Phoebe : Average height...
Phoebe : ...medium build, bald...
UNK: That's fine.
Ross : - Really? - Ross and the bald girl? Absolutely.
Phoebe : Great! Okay! Good for you! All right!
Hoshi : You are iron! You are steel!
UNK: Let me ask you, how come when I call your computer support line...
Hoshi : ...I have to wait an hour and a half?
UNK: We're adding operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
UNK: It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get.
Chandler : - Hi. - Monica.
Pete : - Hi, honey. - On the table. On the table, please.
UNK: So listen, my friends were telling me a little bit about...
UNK: ...this Ultimate Fighting thing.
Monica : It sounds really dangerous.
