UNK: We can't let it happen. We have to do something. We have to break them up.
UNK: Just go in there and shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!
Phoebe : Okay, first of all, breathe.
UNK: Second of all, I don't get it.
UNK: Aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with Ross?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Well, isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
UNK: So?
UNK: It's just, you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.
Rachel : - Oh, no. - What?
Phoebe : We killed them all!
UNK: It's not as bad as it looks. It's a precaution.
UNK: I'm not supposed to move my spine.
UNK: Please tell me you're stopping now.
UNK: I'm fine. I'd fight tonight if they'd let me.
UNK: Now, see this circle I'm marking off here?
Pete : This is my Zone of Terror.
Monica : You are insane! You've got to give this up!
UNK: I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter.
Pete : I will do it.
Pete : The day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight...
Pete : ...me or Superman.
UNK: Not that I could beat Superman, but kids are stupid.
UNK: Just sit down.
UNK: Please listen to me.
Monica : You are terrible at this, okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever.
UNK: Ever!
Pete : I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm...
UNK: ...and a severely bruised Adam's apple, but that really hurt.
UNK: Well, then, you know what?
UNK: I care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this.
Monica : So if you have to do this, you'll have to do it without me.
UNK: If you're asking me to quit...
UNK: ...then you're asking me to be someone I'm not.
UNK: I've got to do this.
UNK: Then I've gotta go.
UNK: Bye.
UNK: [scene : - Monica? - Yes?
Pete : Could you leave a note? I'm on painkillers...
UNK: ...and I might not remember this tomorrow.
UNK: So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I'm happy.
UNK: Great job, team! Tomorrow at 8 : 30.
UNK: Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!
UNK: Goldberg, you maniac!
Monica : I love you!
UNK: - Couldn't have done it without you. - Thank you, sir.
Stevens : Oh, excuse me.
UNK: I forgot my briefcase, you know, by accident.
Doug : Of course, you did. Forgot something else too, you bastard!
Doug : Well, what about you?
UNK: You're not feeling left out, are you?
UNK: No, not at all. That's ridiculous.
Doug : Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
Chandler : Yes, I do.
Doug : Now, get on out of here, you!
UNK: Pete Becker circles the ring.
UNK: Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.
UNK: - Bruiser is charging! - Run.
Chandler : Run, you crazy, rich freak!
UNK: I can't watch this.
UNK: Check it out! Pete's winning!
Ross : - Really? - No!
UNK: Tv Announcer : Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area!
UNK: Wait! If that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Ross : This is ironic.
UNK: Your last boyfriend, Richard, didn't want to have kids.
Ross : From the looks of it, now Pete can't.
