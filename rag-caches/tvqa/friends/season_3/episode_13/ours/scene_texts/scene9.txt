Robert : Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
UNK: I don't know what to say.
Gunther : Hey, buddy? This is a family place. Put the mouse back in the house.
UNK: Really? It's just like everyone else's apartment.
UNK: It's got rooms and walls and ceilings.
Monica : Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Richard : - This is the living room. - That's nice.
UNK: And this is the kitchen.
UNK: That's real pretty. Wait a minute. Don't I get to see the bedroom?
UNK: The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much your typical...
UNK: ...bedroom.
UNK: We're still on this side of the door. But I didn't get to see it.
Richard : Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.
Richard : Thanks for a lovely evening.
UNK: So who is she?
Richard : That was the blind date that I told you about.
Richard : She called and switched it from Tuesday.
Monica : Did you like her?
UNK: I'm just asking as a friend because I am totally fine with this.
Richard : Well, you seem fine.
UNK: Okay, you know what? I'm not fine. I'm not.
UNK: I mean, how could I be fine? Hearing you come in with her.
Monica : She wants to see your bedroom.
UNK: You know what?
UNK: What if we're friends...
UNK: ...who don't see other people?
Richard : You mean like exclusive friends?
Monica : Why not?
Monica : I mean, this has been the most amazing week.
Monica : Would it be so terrible?
Monica : Even if we were friends who lived together?
Monica : Or maybe someday, friends who stood up in front of their other friends...
Monica : ...and vowed to be friends forever.
UNK: You know, we're back where we were.
Richard : Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
UNK: That's not true. You don't have a mustache.
UNK: Okay, one thing's changed.
Richard : But we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end.
UNK: You know what?
UNK: I gotta walk out of here right now...
UNK: ...because getting over you is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
UNK: I don't think I could do it again.
UNK: I know I couldn't.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: So...
UNK: How about one last game of racquetball?
Monica : Watch the thorns!
UNK: What?
Joey : Beth is really, really sick.
UNK: Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she can do.
UNK: [scene : - Joey? - Yeah.
UNK: You wanna put the book in the freezer?
