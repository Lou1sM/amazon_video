Monica : See that guy? He's in classics now...
UNK: ...but as soon as we leave, he's going straight to the porn.
UNK: He'll go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.
UNK: This is nice. I miss this.
Monica : - Yeah. - Excuse me.
UNK: We're gonna be here for a while, so just go back there.
UNK: Yeah, we're not judging.
UNK: So you want to get a hamburger or something?
UNK: I don't know if that's a good idea.
Richard : Look, just friends. I won't grope you. I promise.
UNK: I think it's too soon.
UNK: No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11 : 00.
