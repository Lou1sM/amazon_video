Chandler : Yeah, baby!
Ross : - What are you doing? - Making chocolate milk. You want some?
UNK: No, thanks. I'm 29.
Rachel : Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!
UNK: What time do you think you're gonna get off tonight?
UNK: - I don't know. It could be really late. - Come on. Not again!
UNK: I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a deal with you, okay?
UNK: For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Rachel : ...I will wake you up in a way that has proved very popular in the past.
UNK: Well, now if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Monica : - Hi. - Hey.
Joey : Look at you. Since when do you rollerblade?
Phoebe : Since tomorrow.
Phoebe : I met this really cute guy in the park.
UNK: And he, like, jogs and blades and swims, and so we made a deal.
UNK: He's gonna teach me how to do all sorts of jock stuff.
UNK: And what are you gonna do for him?
UNK: - I'm gonna let him. - Okay.
UNK: Cool.
UNK: - Good morning. - Hey.
Rachel : Somebody got in late last night.
Monica : Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.
Rachel : When did this happen?
UNK: Around 8 : 02.
UNK: We talked for a little while, and then we went out for an innocent burger.
UNK: There's no such thing as an innocent burger.
Ross : - Are you gonna see him again? - Tomorrow night.
Rachel : Monica, what are you doing?
Chandler : She spent the last six months getting over him...
UNK: ...and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
UNK: It's not a date, okay?
UNK: I'm just gonna teach him how to make a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.
UNK: You might wanna make extra, because you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
UNK: We're not gonna have sex.
UNK: Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children, and I still do.
UNK: So that's why we're gonna just be friends.
Ross : Naked friends.
Monica : - Hey. - Hey.
Rachel : - Do you have any ice? - Check the freezer.
UNK: If there's none in there, we're probably out.
UNK: Are you just getting home from work? It's late.
Rachel : Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day, though.
UNK: I got to sit in on a meeting with reps from Calvin Klein.
Rachel : I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie. She ordered a ton. How was your day?
UNK: I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth using just my tongue.
Rachel : Why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Joey : I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so...
UNK: But you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Joey : Well, safer.
Joey : I never start reading The Shining without making sure we got room in the freezer.
Rachel : How often do you read it?
UNK: Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Rachel : I read Little Women more than once.
UNK: That's a classic. What's so great about The Shining?
UNK: The question should be, Rach, what is not so great about The Shining?
UNK: And the answer would be, nothing. All right?
UNK: This is the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
UNK: We'll just see about that, okay?
Rachel : I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
Joey : - All right, you got it. - All right.
UNK: Now, Rach, these little women.
Joey : How little are they?
Joey : I mean, are they, like, scary little?
UNK: You know, I love this fabric.
UNK: I think I'm gonna have a suit made out of this.
Phoebe : Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Monica : - Hey. - Hi.
UNK: You have lipstick right here.
UNK: That's okay. It's mine. We just kissed.
UNK: So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?
UNK: Well, I'm from California.
Chandler : Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flame.
UNK: I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.
UNK: Anybody want anything?
UNK: - I'll have coffee. - Me too.
Ross : Make that three.
UNK: Okay, Ross, why don't you come with me?
