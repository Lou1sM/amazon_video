Ross : What is the matter with you? What's going on?
UNK: Robert's coming out.
Ross : What do you mean? What? Is he gay?
UNK: He's coming out of his shorts.
UNK: What?
Chandler : The man is showing brain.
UNK: Are you sure? Hold on.
UNK: I'm sorry, you guys. That was a coffee and a...
UNK: Coffee. We could write it down.
UNK: No, no, that won't be necessary.
Monica : - Well? - Yeah.
Chandler : - What do we do? What do we do? - Well, I suppose we just...
Ross : ...try to not look directly at it.
Chandler : Like an eclipse.
UNK: When people compliment me on my cooking tonight, what do I say?
UNK: You say, "Thank you very much." And then you buy me something pretty.
UNK: Come on, we're gonna put our hands in this bowl...
UNK: ...and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Richard : This feels very weird.
UNK: You touch people's eyeballs, and this feels weird?
Richard : Sure, I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them.
UNK: That's my hand.
Monica : - Gotta keep squishing. - The tomatoes are squishing.
Monica : You got some on your shirt.
UNK: Hold on one second.
Monica : Just put a little club soda on it. Get to it right away.
UNK: It should do...
UNK: ...the trick.
UNK: What?
UNK: You've got some on your pants.
UNK: I'll just throw them out.
Joey : These little women!
UNK: You're liking it?
Joey : Oh, yeah. Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.
UNK: I don't see how he could forgive her.
UNK: Jo's a girl. It's short for Josephine.
UNK: But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.
UNK: You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?
UNK: Because that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
UNK: No, actually, Laurie's a boy.
Joey : No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Monica : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: How'd the basketball go?
Phoebe : I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.
UNK: You mean a 3-pointer?
UNK: I get more because I'm dainty.
Robert : So is there a phone here I check my messages?
Phoebe : Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter?
Robert : No, thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
Ross : What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the...
UNK: Hello!
UNK: Hi, I'm Joey. We haven't met.
Robert : Good to meet you. Robert.
UNK: What?
Phoebe : What? You guys, what is going on?
UNK: Do you not like Robert?
Phoebe : Why are you laughing?
Ross : Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
Phoebe : - You guys! Come on! - We're sorry.
UNK: We're sorry. It just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area...
UNK: ...as one may have hoped.
Ross : What do you mean?
Monica : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: Robert, could you pass me those cookies?
UNK: Sure.
Monica : - Ball? - Yeah.
UNK: So how'd the lasagna go over?
Monica : Really? Good. So you owe me three pretty things.
