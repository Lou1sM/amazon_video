UNK: - How's it going? - Good.
Joey : Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Rachel : Danny just went into room 217.
UNK: The next part's the best! When that dead lady in the bathtub...
UNK: No! Come on, you're gonna ruin it!
UNK: All right, I'll talk in code.
Joey : Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
UNK: Yeah, that's very cool.
UNK: All blank and no blank makes blank a blank-blank.
Joey : No, the end! When Jack almost kills them all with that blank...
UNK: ...but in the last second they get away.
UNK: Joey, I can't believe you just did that.
UNK: I can't believe she cracked your code.
Rachel : All right. Okay. Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no...
UNK: ...even though she's still in love with him. And then he ends up marrying Amy.
Joey : Hey, mine was by accident!
Joey : All right. The boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad.
Rachel : Beth dies.
Joey : Beth... Beth dies?
Joey : Is that true? If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?
UNK: No, Beth doesn't die. She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?
Monica : - What? - Joey's asking if you've ruined...
UNK: ...the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson.
UNK: No. She doesn't die.
Joey : Then why would you say that?
Rachel : Because I wanted to hurt you.
Robert : There they are. I dropped my keys.
UNK: Got them.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Sorry. I'm sorry.
Monica : You would not believe my day.
Monica : I had to work two shifts. And then to top it off...
Monica : ...I lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire.
Monica : What are you smiling at?
UNK: I was just thinking your day could still pick up.
UNK: Hello.
Monica : I love this friend thing!
UNK: Robert's gonna be here any second, so could one of you just tell him?
Phoebe : Please, right now.
UNK: Every time I see him, it's like, "Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"
UNK: We can't tell him.
UNK: You can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his stuff.
UNK: He's right. Even if it's to say something complimentary.
UNK: Why don't you just tell him? You're going out with him.
UNK: Way too awkward. No. I haven't even seen it with permission yet.
UNK: So, what do I do? Just break up with him?
