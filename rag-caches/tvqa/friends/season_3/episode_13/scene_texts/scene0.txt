UNK: Hi.
Clerk : Six dollars, please.
Monica : Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
UNK: Eight o'clock's the cutoff, and it's 8 : 02.
UNK: You know, in a weird way, you have too much power.
UNK: You have to help me out here because I only have three.
Richard : I can help with that.
Monica : Oh, my God. Richard?
Monica : - Hi. - Hi.
Monica : Your lip went bald.
UNK: Thanks.
Richard : You look great!
UNK: Right.
Richard : No, you do. You just...
UNK: What?
UNK: You got panties stuck to your leg.
UNK: That's because I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and static cling.
UNK: Or maybe it's because God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
UNK: It's good to see you.
UNK: It's good to see you too.
