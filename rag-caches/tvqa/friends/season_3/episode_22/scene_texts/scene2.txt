UNK: You've ruined my life.
UNK: The Director : Please stuff your talentless faces...
UNK: ...with my mother's crab cakes!
Ross : Excuse me!
UNK: Does anyone mind if I save this?
Phoebe : - Is the play over? - Where were you?
UNK: Hold Voice : Thank you for your patience. You're the next caller.
UNK: You were "the next caller" hours ago. You must be going crazy.
UNK: I've kept myself busy.
UNK: Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in her room and her stuff in your room.
Joey : You okay?
UNK: Fabulous.
UNK: Drama critics, they're nothing but people who couldn't make it as actors.
UNK: - You know what to do? - Become a drama critic.
UNK: The Director : I am hurt!
UNK: The Director : A plague...
UNK: The Director : ...on both your houses!
Kate : By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Joey : Oh, classy.
UNK: I sure know how to pick them.
UNK: You know I gave up a part on a soap for this?
Joey : I gave up a job too.
Kate : - Really? What? - Declawing cats.
UNK: Hey, tell you what, let me walk you home.
UNK: We'll stop by every newsstand and burn every copy of The Times and The Post.
Kate : - Why The Post? - You didn't see The Post?
Kate : - No. You? - No. Why?
UNK: You really think these newspapers are just jealous of me?
UNK: Absolutely. You're talented and you're good-looking.
UNK: You're sweet and cute.
UNK: I know. That's why they trashed me.
UNK: - Wait. Wait a minute. - What?
UNK: I don't get you.
Joey : I mean, first you hate me.
Joey : Then you sleep with me.
Joey : Then you want nothing to do with me. Now you want me again?
Kate : You never went out with an actress before?
Joey : Kate, do you even like me?
Kate : - Of course I do. - So how come you blew me off?
Joey : - How come you were with him? - I don't know.
UNK: I just do this.
UNK: I always have to pick, like, the smartest guy...
Kate : ...or the most talented guy.
UNK: Why can't I just pick someone like you?
UNK: Thanks.
Kate : You know what I mean.
Kate : I mean, like, the sweetest guy.
UNK: You're just so...
Gunther : You're so...
UNK: ...so...
UNK: The Director : Here we go. Let's get your feet up there.
Joey : Good night.
Joey : Sweet dreams.
UNK: I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
UNK: Hold Voice : Please stay on the line. Your call is very important to us.
UNK: You've been up for 24 hours. Go to sleep.
UNK: This isn't healthy.
UNK: No, no, I'm fine.
UNK: And you know why? Because of all the riboflavin.
