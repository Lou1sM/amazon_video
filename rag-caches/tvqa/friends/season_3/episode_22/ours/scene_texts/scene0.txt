Rachel : Are you still on hold?
Rachel : I was supposed to call my dad back two hours ago.
UNK: Oh, yeah. He clicked on.
Phoebe : Call him as soon as you get a chance. He's at Flimbees.
UNK: What's Flimbees?
UNK: That's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
UNK: Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!
UNK: No. That's what they want me to do.
Phoebe : My warranty expires tomorrow. If I don't get through...
UNK: ...they won't fix my crappy, broken phone for free!
Phoebe : We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
UNK: Yes!
UNK: I say hang up.
UNK: It's Chandler and us versus Monica and them.
Phoebe : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: I gotta double-check for tickets tonight. Who got what?
UNK: I have one.
UNK: I need two. I'm bringing Pete.
Monica : My boyfriend.
Monica : I have a boyfriend now.
UNK: Two it is. How about you?
UNK: Yeah, I also need two.
UNK: Really? Who's number two?
UNK: Whose Number Two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
UNK: No one, it's just this person.
UNK: Like a date-type person?
UNK: Yeah, kind of. It's this woman from work.
UNK: I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
UNK: Not at all. I was actually gonna bring someone myself.
UNK: But you said one ticket.
Rachel : I meant me plus one.
UNK: Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?
UNK: All right. I'll see you tonight.
Rachel : Okay. Bye-bye.
UNK: Bye-bye.
Rachel : Okay, I need a date!
Joey : Oh, hey! You guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
UNK: And I borrowed your cologne. I hope she likes it.
Monica : What are you doing? She's seeing somebody.
UNK: Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
Joey : - Bottle next to the shaving cream. - Worm medicine for the duck.
Monica : - Here you go. You can wear this. - Thanks. Okay.
UNK: I'm setting the phone down.
UNK: But I'm still here.
UNK: Just don't go anywhere. I'm still here.
UNK: Don't switch or anything, because I'm right here. Just one sec.
Phoebe : One sec. One second!
Phoebe : Wait! One second! Just...
UNK: What? Monica, I'm scared!
UNK: Honey, that's a sleeve.
UNK: And we also have a speakerphone.
UNK: Hold Voice : Please stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Monica : You gotta hang up. We'll be late.
UNK: Hold Voice : Thank you for your patience. You're the next caller.
UNK: Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!
Phoebe : You were gonna have me hang up.
Chandler : Can you take a duck and a chick to the theater?
Monica : Of course not.
Chandler : I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
UNK: All right, fellas, back to Nintendo.
