UNK: Didn't you have that on last night?
UNK: I stayed at Kate's but nothing happened.
UNK: Yeah, last time I was at Pete's we just watched a movie...
UNK: ...of us...
UNK: ...that we'd made earlier.
UNK: I'm sorry, I can't help it. I have a boyfriend.
UNK: Hey, where were you?
UNK: I'm so, so sorry. I am definitely gonna see your play.
UNK: I swear, your play is very important to us. Thank you for your patience.
UNK: Your play is the next play I'm gonna see.
UNK: How'd it go with Kate?
Joey : It was great!
Joey : I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected.
Joey : Then she passed out.
Joey : But then she woke up.
Joey : And we stayed up all night talking.
UNK: And now we're crazy about each other!
UNK: You had "the night"!
UNK: When two people realize their feelings for each other...
UNK: ...and they talk for hours and learn all about the other person.
Joey : You think?
UNK: - Did you learn about her family? - Two brothers. One died!
UNK: Yes!
Gunther : This is from the woman at the bar.
Gunther : Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
Rachel : - What time is it? - One.
UNK: 7 : 15.
UNK: Watch doesn't work.
UNK: Tommy's supposed to be here soon. We're going to lunch.
UNK: Look, I wasn't gonna say anything to you, but...
UNK: All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
UNK: You don't?
Ross : The guy is mean. I mean, really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Rachel : Or maybe I should stay away from all men.
UNK: It's not just because I'm jealous.
UNK: I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.
UNK: Look, the guy actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Chandler : Yeah, and at the end of the play...
UNK: ...he got up, and he just started, like, banging his hands together.
UNK: You don't want to believe me, that's fine.
UNK: We're kidding.
UNK: No one believe me. I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!
Ross : - Sorry, Tommy. - What's in the cup?
Tommy : What is in the cup?
UNK: Okay, it's coffee.
UNK: Iced coffee? Tell me it's iced coffee.
