UNK: Oh, hi, how are you?
UNK: Good.
UNK: - Looks like we're the first ones here. - Looks that way.
Ross : First ones here!
Rachel : Oh, Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin. Cailin...
UNK: Sorry.
Ross : And break!
UNK: I think I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.
UNK: - I'll join you. - I'll get our seats.
UNK: Well, this is...
UNK: ...awkward.
UNK: Well, because Rachel and I used to go out.
UNK: Oh, I didn't know that.
Ross : Well, then this is awkward.
Ross : - So, what do you...? - I think we're here.
UNK: Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Ross : I think you may be in our seats.
UNK: No, I don't think so.
UNK: - Could we take a look at your ticket? - Sure.
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13"...
Man : Oh, well, I thought that...
UNK: You thought? Well, that didn't really work out for you. Idiot!
Tommy : What are you, a moron? It says, "D-13"! Okay?
UNK: You're surrounded by even numbers! Does that give you a clue?
UNK: - The usher told me... - The usher must be right!
UNK: With all his training!
Tommy : Get out!
UNK: Here!
Tommy : - Hey, man, you want the aisle? - No, I'm good.
Chandler : - There he is! - There's our star!
UNK: You were great!
UNK: So? What'd you think?
UNK: Almost as good as the play with the two naked girls on the seesaw.
UNK: - I wasn't in that. - I know.
Joey : I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
UNK: The Director : Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart!
UNK: Come!
UNK: So that's the girl you like.
UNK: I tell you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy.
UNK: He viciously screamed at total strangers. I think he's bad news.
UNK: Wait a minute. You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?
UNK: Well, that's odd.
Joey : Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
UNK: Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.
Lauren : I ran into you in the hallway in your building.
Lauren : It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
UNK: So how'd you guys meet?
UNK: The short version is, I pursued her for a couple of months.
UNK: Then I gave her a check for $20,000 and she was mine.
Monica : In the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Estelle : Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
Joey : You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Estelle : How do you do?
Estelle : Oh, you two girls were outstanding!
UNK: Do they have representation?
UNK: They weren't in the play.
UNK: We're not actors.
Estelle : What a shame!
UNK: With her face and her chest, I could really put something together.
Chandler : Could I borrow it?
Cailin : Hi. Remember me?
UNK: Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line for the bathroom...
Ross : ...and someone just cut. I think he's gonna snap.
UNK: I'm gonna go.
Ross : Go? Why?
UNK: I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like...
UNK: ...waiting all night for a guy who may or may not scream.
Ross : He definitely will scream.
UNK: Goodbye.
UNK: The Director : Here we go, people!
UNK: "Boxing Day.
UNK: The Director : The Lucille Lortel Theatre...
UNK: Joey Tribbiani gives an uneven performance.
UNK: But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst thing in this production."
UNK: Yes!
UNK: "Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable."
UNK: Here it is! "The direction...
UNK: ...by Marshall Townend is..."
UNK: The Director : Thank you, boys and girls.
