Monica : Julio, someone left their book here.
Julio : Actually, that is mine.
Monica : What are you reading?
UNK: Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire. Have you read it?
Monica : Have I read it?
Monica : No. Are you enjoying it?
UNK: I thought that I would, but the translation's no good.
UNK: You're a poet, and you don't know it.
Julio : Actually, I...
Julio : I am a poet.
UNK: So you do know it.
Monica : So, what kind of things do you write about?
UNK: Things that move me :
Julio : The shadow of a tree...
Julio : ...a child laughing...
Julio : ...or this lip.
UNK: Mine?
Monica : Right here?
UNK: I could write an epic poem about this lip.
Monica : How would that go?
Monica : Well, it didn't rhyme...
Monica : ...but I liked it.
UNK: Lovely.
Director : Just lovely.
Joey : Really? Thanks.
Director : Listen, Joey. We definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
UNK: Excellent!
Joey : - I'll be there. - Okay.
Director : And listen, don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
UNK: My agent said that it wasn't a dancing part.
UNK: Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.
Director : Believe me, with your dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.
UNK: "Three years of modern dance with Twyla Tharp"?
UNK: "Five years with the American Ballet Theatre"?
Joey : Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay?
Joey : I wasn't one of the Zoom kids either.
UNK: Well, can you, like, dance at all?
Joey : Yeah, I can dance. You know...
Chandler : Oh, no, no, no, no.
Phoebe : What is that?
Joey : Sure, it looks stupid now. There's no music playing.
Chandler : I have to get that. But, no, no.
UNK: Hello. Hi.
UNK: Yeah, listen, I'm in need of a stripper, and I was told that you do that.
UNK: Let me ask you this. What do you do for the extra hundred?
UNK: So would I have to provide the grapes?
UNK: Hi.
Phoebe : How was last night with Julio, senorita?
UNK: It so was amazing. He's so sexy and smart, which makes him even sexier.
UNK: I gotta tell you this. Last night, we were fooling around...
UNK: ...and all of a sudden he stops to write a poem.
Joey : Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Chandler : Okay, we have our stripper, a Miss Crystal Chandelier.
Joey : Sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Monica : Anyway, when he left, he forgot to take the poem with him.
UNK: Now, I am totally dense about poetry, but I think this is pretty good.
UNK: Check it out. Read it.
UNK: "The Empty Vase." Translucent beauty...
Chandler : To yourself.
UNK: You know what? That's pretty good.
Monica : Good. I think so too. Phoebe?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Great! I'm so glad you guys like it!
Monica : - All right, I gotta go to work. - Hold on. I'm not done.
UNK: All right, give it back when you're through.
Monica : - See you guys. - Bye-bye.
Phoebe : Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Poor Monica!
Chandler : What? What? What?
Phoebe : What? He was with her when he wrote this poem!
