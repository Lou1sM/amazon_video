Ross : And I lost her.
Ross : And now, if it's possible, I think I love you even more.
Ross : So it's hard for me to believe I'm not gonna...
UNK: ...well, that someone else isn't gonna take you away.
Gunther : Let it be me. Let it be me!
Rachel : Honey, that's very sweet.
Rachel : It just seems to me, though, that if two people love each other...
Rachel : ...and trust each other, like we do...
Rachel : ...there's no reason to be jealous.
Ross : I gotta get going. Bye, Chandler.
UNK: Okay, Ross, this pen's getting kind of boring. Can you pick me up some porn?
UNK: Where you going?
UNK: I've gotta go pick up Ben. We got a play-date this afternoon.
Rachel : With who?
UNK: Just this woman I met last night at the party.
Rachel : There was a woman at...?
Rachel : The stripper?
Chandler : - Yeah. - You have a play-date with a stripper?
Chandler : Man, I gotta get a kid!
UNK: Yeah, we started talking after she did her thing...
Ross : ...and it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age.
UNK: So we're gonna take the kids to a Gymboree class.
Ross : - Is that okay? - Sure. Is she married?
UNK: No.
Ross : Are you jealous?
UNK: No, I just don't see why she has to play with you. That's all.
UNK: I mean, doesn't she, you know, have any other stripper-mom friends of her own?
Ross : You are totally jealous!
Rachel : I'm not jealous, all right. This is about...
Rachel : ...people feeling certain things...
UNK: ...you know, about...
UNK: ...strippers. And, you know...
Ross : I love you too.
UNK: Bye.
Rachel : Wait, wait, wait!
UNK: What?
UNK: Well, there's a kiss he won't forget for a few hours.
Chandler : Either that or you just turned him on and sent him to a stripper.
UNK: All right, I'm jealous. I'm jealous!
UNK: "Oh, no. Chandler, please don't. No, I beg of you to not..."
Man : Is there a Julio here?
Julio : I am Julio.
UNK: Mr. Pretentious
