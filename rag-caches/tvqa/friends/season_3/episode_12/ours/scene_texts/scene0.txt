Rachel : - Does everybody hate these shoes? - Yeah.
UNK: But don't worry. Nobody's gonna focus on that if you wear that towel-dress.
Rachel : Tell him.
Ross : It's her first day at this new job. You're not supposed to start with her.
Chandler : All right, I suppose I can wait a day.
Chandler : - What are you doing Friday? - Why?
UNK: I need you at a bachelor party for my weird cousin, Albert.
UNK: You know, he's the botanist?
Ross : Oh, God!
Ross : Botanists are such geeks.
Chandler : Is that a dinosaur tie?
UNK: Morning!
Phoebe : Rach, I'm here with the purses!
Chandler : It must take you forever to find your keys.
Rachel : Thank you, Pheebs.
UNK: You're welcome. Please want the one with the turtles.
Rachel : No, turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Ross : Honey, just relax. It's gonna be fine.
Ross : Why don't I come down there, and I'll take you to lunch?
Rachel : Honey, thank you! But Mark's taking me out.
UNK: Mark? Is that the same Mark that helped you get the job?
UNK: Yeah, it's kind of like a "good luck on your first day" sort of thing.
UNK: Is this a lunch box?
Phoebe : No, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Chandler : - So can you make it on Friday? - What?
Ross : Yeah, I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Chandler : Apparently, Albert has no friends.
Chandler : He's very excited about the bachelor party.
UNK: I think, actually, he's only getting married so he can see a stripper.
Phoebe : A stripper at a bachelor party. That is so cliche.
UNK: Why don't you guys get a magician?
UNK: Well, if a magician can open my beer with his butt cheeks, then all right.
Ross : She's having lunch with him? Lunch with him?
UNK: You should've seen the hug he gave her when she got the job!
UNK: And he's really good-looking.
Ross : - What am I gonna do? - You don't do anything.
Chandler : Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings.
UNK: Don't cry out loud.
UNK: Guess who has an audition for a Broadway musical?
UNK: I wanna say you, but it seems like such an easy answer.
Joey : It is me! It's a musical version of A Tale of Two Cities.
Joey : So I think I'm gonna sing "New York, New York"...
UNK: ...and "I Left My Heart in San Francisco."
Ross : Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Chandler : - What? - Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.
UNK: Who?
Chandler : I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Joey : - The what? - The abridgment.
UNK: Okay.
Joey : The what?
UNK: Then the style number...
Mark : ...the invoice number and the shipping date.
Mark : Good. Any questions so far?
Rachel : What kind of discount do we get?
Mark : - Twenty percent. - I love this job!
Rachel : - My first call! - Here, let me.
UNK: Rachel Greene's line. How may I help you?
Ross : Hi, is Rachel there?
Mark : - And who may I say is calling? - This is Ross.
Mark : Ross of...?
Ross : Of Ross and Rachel.
UNK: Hi, it's Mark.
Ross : - Hey, Mark. - Hey.
Mark : Hold on a second. It's Ross.
