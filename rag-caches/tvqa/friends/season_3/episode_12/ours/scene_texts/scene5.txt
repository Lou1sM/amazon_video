UNK: What?
UNK: Joey, come on. It's easy. You know, it's hand, hand...
Director : ...head, head...
UNK: ...up, pas de bourree, pas de bourree, big turn here, rond de jambe.
UNK: Slide, step, step...
Director : ...and jazz hands!
UNK: It's steppity-step and jazz hands.
Director : Have fun.
UNK: Bye.
Rachel : - Hey. - Hey.
Phoebe : What are you wrapping?
Monica : Look what I got Julio.
Phoebe : Yeah, it's a vase.
Monica : Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Phoebe : Not exactly like the one in the poem.
Monica : What do you mean?
Phoebe : Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry?
Monica : So I'm just an empty vase?
UNK: What?
Monica : So, I don't read as many important books as you do.
Monica : And I don't write trick poems that aren't actually what they seem.
UNK: And you know what? I get excited about stupid stuff...
UNK: ...like when my People magazine comes on Saturday...
Monica : ...and the new Hold Everything catalog.
UNK: But that doesn't mean I'm empty. I care about things, like friends and family.
Monica : You have no right to make that kind of judgment! You don't even know me!
Julio : The poem is not about you.
Chandler : - What? - "The Empty Vase" is not about you.
UNK: My baby preciosa, you make me so sad that you would think this.
UNK: I'm sorry. It's... My friend Phoebe said...
Phoebe : No, it's... It's about all women.
Julio : Well, all American women.
Julio : You feel better now?
Director : All right, let's do it.
Director : What was that?
UNK: I know. It's the best I could get out of them.
Director : Well, people!
Joey : People, people, people!
Director : Let's try it again. And this time, let's everybody watch Joey.
UNK: Show them how it's done.
UNK: Count it off, Mack.
Rachel : Did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Chandler : Yeah, look what I got! See, she's fully dressed, right?
Chandler : And then you click it, and she's naked!
Chandler : And then you click it again, and she's dressed.
Chandler : She's a business woman, walking down the street.
Chandler : She's window shopping, and she's naked!
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: You know what? I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Ross : I'm sorry. I was an idiot.
Rachel : A big idiot.
Rachel : A big idiot.
UNK: It's just you have to realize this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.
UNK: Honey, why is it hard? We've been together for almost a year now.
Ross : Well, I was with Carol for, like, eight years.
