Joey : She was, like, the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
UNK: - Where are your parents? - They're in Vermont, buying cigarettes.
UNK: Where's Mary Angela?
UNK: - She's right in there. - Okay.
Ross : - Hey, Chandler! - Hey, Chandler!
UNK: I can't believe Mark didn't call.
UNK: - It's Sunday night and he didn't call. - Bummer.
Rachel : Yeah, right. Look at you. You're practically giddy.
UNK: I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out.
Ross : Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Monica : Wait a minute. Why don't you just call Mark?
Monica : Who says you have to sit and wait for him?
UNK: You've got to make stuff happen!
UNK: Yeah, but you don't wanna seem too pushy.
UNK: It's not pushy. He gave her his home number.
Ross : He gave you his home number, as in, to his home?
UNK: And you don't mind if I call, because you want good things for me.
UNK: That's right, good things. That is what I said.
Rachel : Hello. Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Greene.
Rachel : Oh, no. Don't you apologize.
UNK: Yeah, I'll hold.
Rachel : He left my number at work and was gonna get it...
UNK: ...but he had to help his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Ross : That is so made up!
Rachel : Oh, my God! Tomorrow?
UNK: That's... No, it's perfect.
UNK: Oh, God! Thank you so much!
Rachel : Great. Bye.
Rachel : - I got the interview! - There you go!
Rachel : He even offered to meet me for lunch and prep me for it.
Monica : That is amazing!
Ross : Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do...
UNK: ...I'd expect nothing less.
UNK: I gotta figure out what to wear.
Ross : High collar and baggy pants say, "I'm a pro!"
Rachel : Yeah, right. Okay, I'll see you guys later.
UNK: You go get them!
Ross : What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Joey : - What? - "Why don't you call him?"
Ross : Well, thank you very much. Now he's gonna prep her...
UNK: ...as in what you do before you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Monica : Are you crazy?
Ross : Am I? Am I out of my mind? Am I losing my senses?
UNK: This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend out for a meal!
UNK: This isn't even about you!
UNK: It's about something wonderful happening for Rachel.
UNK: Even if you're right, and he wants to sleep with her...
UNK: ...does that mean he gets to?
UNK: - No, but... - Don't you trust her?
Monica : Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Ross : You grow up.
UNK: This tiramisu is excellent. Did you make it, Mary Angela?
UNK: Well, it's yummy.
UNK: So... Mary Angela, do you like it?
UNK: Of course. It's her favorite.
UNK: So... Mary Angela, what's your second favorite?
UNK: More of Grandma's tiramisu.
UNK: Oh, would you just please...
UNK: ...give me your recipe, because this is great! It's topnotch!
Chandler : So will I.
Chandler : I was just squinting. It doesn't mean anything.
Chandler : Will you excuse me, I have to...
