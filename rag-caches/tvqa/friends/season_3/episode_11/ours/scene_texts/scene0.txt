Joey : Okay, pick a card. Any card.
Joey : All right, now memorize it.
UNK: Show it to everybody.
Joey : Got it?
Joey : All right. Give it back to me.
UNK: Five of hearts.
Ross : Real magic does exist.
UNK: - Joey, how do you do it? - I can't tell you that.
UNK: Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
UNK: That's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
UNK: He took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.
UNK: Why don't you go ask him to just, "Step lightly, please?"
Monica : I have, like, five times. But the guy is so charming...
Monica : ...I go up there to yell, then I end up apologizing to him.
Phoebe : That is silly!
UNK: I'll go up there. I'll tell him to keep it down.
Monica : - All right, be my guest. - Good luck.
Joey : All right, all right...
UNK: ...if you wanna know how I did it, I'll show you.
Joey : When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was...
Joey : ...I looked at it so fast, it was invisible to the naked eye.
Joey : I just did it.
Joey : Just did it again.
UNK: Here, I'll slow it down so you guys can see it. Ready?
UNK: - I got it now! - Okay.
Phoebe : Thank you.
UNK: Hi. Anybody got a length of rope about six feet long...
UNK: ...little noose at the end?
UNK: - Honey, what's the matter? - I just saw Janice.
Chandler : She was at Rockefeller Center, skating with her husband. She looked so happy.
Chandler : I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
Joey : I remember the first time I saw Katherine after we broke up.
UNK: She was with her friend Donna. Just laughing and talking.
Joey : God, it killed me!
Chandler : Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Joey : Sorry, I just... Any excuse to tell that story, you know?
UNK: Chandler, there's a party tomorrow. You'll feel better then.
UNK: I'm gonna be okay. You don't have to throw a party for me.
UNK: It's Joey's birthday.
Chandler : Then if anybody should have a party, it should be him.
Monica : I cannot believe she's still up there.
Chandler : Well, he totally screwed up the punch line.
UNK: You know, it's supposed to be...
UNK: - How's that coffee coming, dear? - Right away, Mr. Kaplan.
UNK: I'm not suppose to drink coffee. It makes me gassy.
Rachel : I know.
UNK: I'll bet you're thinking, "What's an intelligent girl...
UNK: Mr. Kaplan : ...who wants to be in fashion doing making coffee?"
Rachel : You got me.
UNK: Don't think I haven't noticed your potential.
UNK: I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion.
UNK: Mr. Kaplan : - How does that sound? - That sounds great!
UNK: Mr. Kaplan : - Come on over here, sweetheart. - Thank you so much.
UNK: Mr. Kaplan : I need these hangers separated ASAP.
UNK: You're welcome.
Rachel : - Oh, God, I hate my job! I hate it. - I know, honey. I'm sorry.
Rachel : I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out.
UNK: Then I think :
UNK: "Why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job...
UNK: ...just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?"
UNK: Gee, I don't know, Rach.
UNK: Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans and a Howdy, hold the Doody.
UNK: Come on, I'm sorry. I didn't... I don't mind paying my dues, you know?
UNK: But how much will I learn about fashion...
UNK: ...by walking Myra, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom?
Rachel : Hi. Is my misery amusing to you?
