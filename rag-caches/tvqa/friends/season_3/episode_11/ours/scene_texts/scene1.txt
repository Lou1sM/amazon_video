UNK: I'm sorry, I was just...
UNK: It's not funny. This is actually my job.
UNK: No, believe me, I've been there.
Guy : I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
UNK: Well, then. I'm just gonna go back to talking to my friend here.
Rachel : You can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
UNK: Actually, that's a Barbra Streisand-wich.
UNK: What? I named that one.
Guy : - Just one other thing. - Yes?
UNK: I work at Bloomingdale's.
Guy : I might know of a job possibility, if you're interested.
Rachel : Do you want my pickle?
Gunther : - Hey, guys. - Hey, Gunther.
UNK: You're going on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
UNK: - Well, he's very charming. - I know. He's too charming!
UNK: But if you go out, it'll be harder for me to hate him.
UNK: Well, you're just going to have to try.
Monica : Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?
UNK: I don't know. Chandler's passing them...
UNK: Chandler!
UNK: Hello-dee-lo!
UNK: Well, somebody's feeling better.
Monica : - Stick out your tongue! - Take off your shirt!
Monica : - Oh, my...! - Oh, my God!
UNK: How many did you have? These are pure vodka.
Chandler : Yeah, Jell-O. Just like Mom used to make.
Rachel : The most unbelievable thing happened today.
UNK: I'm having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me.
Rachel : He works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's.
UNK: There's an opening there! So I gave him my phone number.
UNK: He's gonna call me this weekend to get me an interview!
Rachel : I know!
UNK: What, so this guy's helping you for no apparent reason?
UNK: - And he's a total stranger? - Yeah. His name is Mark something.
Ross : Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex!
UNK: What?
UNK: I'm just saying. Why else would he swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?
Rachel : To be nice.
Ross : Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Joey : - No, only for sex. - Thank you.
UNK: So did you tell Mark Something about me?
UNK: I didn't have to.
UNK: I was wearing my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board and ringing my bell.
UNK: Joey! Happy birthday!
Chandler : How many of that girl are you seeing?
Monica : How hammered are you? These are Joey's sisters.
UNK: Hi, Joey's sisters!
UNK: What are we drinking over here?
UNK: Well, I have a vodka and cranberry juice.
UNK: No kidding?
UNK: That's the same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
UNK: Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
UNK: What you doing?
UNK: I'm taking my ex-girlfriend off my speed dialer.
UNK: No, it's a good thing.
Chandler : Why must we dial so speedily, anyway? Why rush through life?
UNK: Why can't we savor the precious moments?
Chandler : Those are some huge breasts you have!
Joey : - Hi. - Hi.
UNK: So I heard about this Mark guy that Rachel met today.
UNK: - Isn't it great? - Oh, yeah!
UNK: So yeah, pretty good... He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Monica : Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy!
UNK: I mean, when he left, I actually used the phrase :
UNK: "Hummina, hummina, hummina."
UNK: That's excellent.
UNK: So he's "just a nice guy."
UNK: Do you really think this Mark doesn't want anything for helping you?
UNK: Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him.
UNK: But, you know, that's true of any job.
