Chandler : We should all calm down...
UNK: ...because your brother's not gonna punch me.
Chandler : - Are you? - That is usually what I would do.
UNK: But I never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it.
Joey : How could you do this?
UNK: Hey, where'd everybody go?
UNK: Why don't you go into the den? I think Cops is on.
Chandler : If you wanna punch me, go ahead. I deserve it.
UNK: But I want you to know that I'd never soberly hurt you or your family.
UNK: You're my best friend.
UNK: And I would never do anything like this, ever again.
Cookie : So what? I say punch him!
All : Yeah, punch him!
UNK: No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.
UNK: - I'll do it. - No, you won't!
Joey : He knows he did a terrible thing, and I believe him. He's sorry.
UNK: But you got one more apology to make. You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.
UNK: - Okay. Absolutely. You got it. - All right.
Joey : - Cookie, now you can punch him! - What?
UNK: Hey! What are you doing here?
UNK: You know, this building's on my paper route, so...
UNK: How did it go?
Rachel : The woman I interviewed with was pretty tough...
UNK: ...but thank God Mark coached me.
UNK: Once I talked about the Fall line, she got all happy.
UNK: - I'm so proud of you. - Me too!
UNK: Listen, I'm...
UNK: I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and...
UNK: It's just, I like you a lot, so...
Rachel : - I know. - Yeah?
UNK: - Rachel. Hi. - Hi, Mark.
Mark : I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got the job.
Joey : - I did? - Yes!
Joey : Oh, my God!
UNK: Congratulations...
UNK: So, Phoebe, how was your date?
UNK: Oh, well, you know...
Monica : Yeah, I do know.
Phoebe : You were eavesdropping?
Rachel : Eavesdropping? Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry.
Phoebe : But I really like this guy...
Phoebe : ...and I think he really happens to likes me.
UNK: Maybe he's just...
UNK: ...jumping on a pogo stick and he really likes it.
UNK: Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.
UNK: All right, that's it. He cannot do this to Phoebe!
UNK: This guy's gonna get the butt-kicking of a lifetime!
Joey : But is he a big guy?
UNK: We'll all go. Come on.
UNK: Well, let's see, I just got beat up by a girl...
UNK: They need me.
Phoebe : - Thanks, you guys. Thank you! - Don't worry!
UNK: God! I hope they kick his ass!
UNK: Honey, I'm sorry.
UNK: If it's any consolation...
Monica : ...he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
