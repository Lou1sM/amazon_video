UNK: How you feeling?
UNK: Well, my apartment isn't there anymore because I drank it.
UNK: Where'd you go? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Chandler : I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
UNK: No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."
Phoebe : Why, what happened?
UNK: I fooled around with Joey's sister.
UNK: - That's not the worst part. - What is the worst part?
UNK: I can't remember which sister.
Ross : You see what men do? Don't tell me men are nice.
Ross : This is men!
Monica : Are you insane?
UNK: Joey will kill you. He'll actually kill you dead.
UNK: You don't think I thought of that?
Phoebe : - How can you not know which one? - That's unbelievable.
Monica : - Was it Gina? - Which one's Gina?
UNK: The dark, big hair, with airplane earrings.
UNK: No, that's not Gina. That's Dina.
UNK: You see? You can't tell which is which either!
UNK: We didn't fool around with any of them.
UNK: It's gotta be Veronica. The girl in the red skirt.
Chandler : I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat!
Monica : That was me.
UNK: When I drink, sometimes I get overly friendly and I'm sorry.
UNK: - That's okay. - That's all right.
UNK: That's okay.
Joey : Can I talk to you for a second?
Ross : Hey, Joey!
UNK: Mr. Kaplan : Come on.
UNK: Why can't we talk in here...
Chandler : ...with witnesses?
Joey : I just got off the phone with my sister.
Phoebe : - Which one? - Mary Angela.
UNK: - Mary Angela. - Yeah.
UNK: Now which one is she again?
UNK: Why don't you ask Chandler? He fooled around with her.
Joey : She told me you said you could really fall for her.
UNK: - What's it about? - I don't remember.
Monica : - Do you wanna take a walk? - Yeah, I do.
UNK: "Dear Mary Angela :
UNK: Hi, how's it going?
Ross : This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write."
UNK: What the hell's the matter with you?
UNK: How will Joey react to you blowing off his sister with a letter?
UNK: That's the part where you tell him that I moved to France...
UNK: ...when actually I'll be in Cuba.
UNK: Look, you've got to do this yourself. In person. At least you know her name.
Ross : You just go to the house and ask for Mary Angela.
UNK: When whichever one she is comes to the door...
Ross : ...you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
UNK: What if Mary Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary Angela?
Ross : Where in Cuba?
UNK: Joey! What are you doing here?
Joey : Waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry.
Joey : - What about you? - I'm here to see Mary Angela.
UNK: You are so the man! Come on.
Joey : Now look, listen. Listen...
UNK: Be cool, because Grandma doesn't know about you two.
UNK: And you do not wanna tick her off.
