UNK: Kids, in the spring of 2011, Zoey and I broke up.
UNK: But the good news...
UNK: Goliath National Bank was finally ready to demolish The Arcadian
UNK: and build the new headquarters I'd designed for them.
UNK: The only problem was I kept butting heads
UNK: with my project supervisor on one very important issue.
Ted : I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!
Barney : - I want to press it! - No, I want!
Barney : I want to press it!
Robin : I dated you both and neither of you is good at pressing
Robin : or even finding the button.
Robin : After some awkward pawing around, that building
UNK: is going to fake an implosion, say, "Baby, that was great",
Robin : and go to sleep.
UNK: Both Ted and Barney, at the same time : She means you.
Barney : I want to press it.
UNK: Both Ted and Barney, at the same time : I'm gonna press it!
