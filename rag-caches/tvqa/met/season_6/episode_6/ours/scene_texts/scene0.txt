UNK: Kids, in the fall of 2010, our friends Stuart and Claudia had a baby,
UNK: and Marshall and Lily were the first to visit the happy new parents.
Marshall : So, have you guys landed on a name yet?
Stuart : We're trying, but it's tougher than you think. You see, I like "Tiffany."
Claudia : And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.
Stuart : - That's my mother's name. - I know.
UNK: I got it. How'bout we name the baby after you... "Frigid Shrew."
Claudia : That's good.
Claudia : Let's call her "Vodka."
Claudia : Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go!
Stuart : Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it.
Marshall : Stuart, you are so...
Marshall : That's not gonna be us, right? I mean,
Marshall : how hard can it be to name a baby?
Marshall : Right? I mean, just look at her.
Lily : She's clearly a...
Lily : - Lisa. - Emily.
Lily : - Emily?! - Lisa?!
UNK: 6x06 - Baby Talk 1.00 . : : www.sous-titres.eu : : .
UNK: I made a list of awesome baby names.
UNK: Starting at the top : number one...
Ted : I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall.
Ted : You name a chubby white kid "LeBron,"
Ted : and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.
Marshall : Then I'm also crossing off, "Shaquille"...
Marshall : "Hakeem,"
Marshall : and "Dikembe."
Marshall : What about "Rob"?
Marshall : "Rob"?
Marshall : Why not?
Lily : Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?
Rob : Honka, honka!
Lily : Not "Rob."
Marshall : How about "Ryan"?
Lily : Not "Ryan."
Marshall : "Johnny?"
Lily : Hey, where's the goldfish?
Lily : Not "Johnny."
Lily : Or "Gil."
Marshall : "Jeremy."
Lily : Definitely not "Jeremy."
Lily : His stuff was so derivative.
Marshall : Well, I mean, geez, Lily.
Robin : Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby "Becky," right?
Marshall : Why? What?
Robin : Becky. My new co-anchor?
Robin : Don't you guys ever watch the show?
Lily : - I really try. - Our DVR won't recognize it
Marshall : as a television program.
Ted : I watched.
Ted : Robin insisted I confirm how "awful" Becky is,
Ted : so last night I checked it out.
Robin : Peace talks in the region have been described as "productive."
Robin : Becky?
UNK: Last night, in Staten Island,
UNK: a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint.
UNK: That's so sad.
UNK: Becky, we're journalists.
Robin : We can't get emotional about the news, we...
Becky : They stole all his money and then pelted him with his own taco meat!
Becky : Who would do that?
Robin : If you read the story, we might find out.
Becky : Can I do this one, about the horse?
Becky : I love horseys.
Becky : The horse died.
Becky : Guys!
Becky : This news is all really sad.
Robin : Okay, no holds barred...
Robin : What'd you think of Becky?
Ted : - I thought she was charming. - You, too?
Robin : Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?
UNK: Long or short version?
Barney : Short version.
Barney : Short version.
Barney : Who's your daddy?
Lily : You know, when you think about that,
Lily : that phrase is really creepy.
Marshall : No, it's not. It's fun.
Marshall : Here, watch this.
Barney : Who's your daddy?
Robin : Let me get this straight. So, in this scenario,
Robin : because you make such sweet love to Lily,
Robin : she is now your daughter.
Marshall : No, she is not my daughter. I'm just...
Marshall : her daddy.
Ted : - That is disgusting. - Exactly. And it's not like
Robin : the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around
Robin : - talking like a little boy. - Challenge accepted.
Barney : I, Barney Stinson,
Barney : will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.
Lily : Here's my list of baby names.
Lily : What about "Tara"?
