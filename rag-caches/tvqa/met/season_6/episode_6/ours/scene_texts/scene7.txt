Barney : No guy's gonna say "Who's your daddy?" to you.
Barney : You're your own daddy.
Barney : And mommy.
Barney : And weird survivalist uncle
UNK: who lives in a cabin with a gun blaming the government.
Barney : That is what makes you the most...
Barney : amazing, strong...
Barney : independent woman I've ever banged.
Robin : There's something I wanted to ask you,
Robin : and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes.
Robin : Who's the crazy chick in the apron?
Woman : Someone naughty left his toys on the floor
Woman : and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.
UNK: I'm in "twubble."
Woman : You did it? How?
Barney : Last night, after admitting defeat,
Barney : I just let myself go.
Woman : That looks so good. Can I have some?
Barney : It's my ice cream, you can't have any.
Woman : Someone needs to teach you how to share.
Woman : Who's your mommy?
Barney : Challenge completed!
UNK: Can you get her out? I'm scared.
Robin : I got this.
Lily : So you finally agreed on a name?
Claudia : The other night she ran a really high fever.
UNK: We rushed her to the ER at 3 : 00 in the morning,
UNK: but they wouldn't admit her without a name.
UNK: Right then,
UNK: we realized how stupid we were being.
Claudia : We looked at each other
UNK: and we just knew.
Claudia : Our baby's name is...
Lily : Esther.
Marshall : Beautiful.
Lily : We're idiots.
UNK: Names and gender, it's like...
Marshall : it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control.
Marshall : I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound...
Marshall : Ten-pound?
Marshall : - Eight-pound? - I guess,
UNK: but you're writing checks my vagina can't cash.
Marshall : I love you.
Marshall : And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have.
Lily : Me, too.
Ted : You know what?
Marshall : We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy.
Stuart : Like...
UNK: Marshall & Lily : Jamie.
Lily : We just named our baby.
Lily : Not Jamie.
Ted : Shoe's untied. I got it.
Ted : This is over.
