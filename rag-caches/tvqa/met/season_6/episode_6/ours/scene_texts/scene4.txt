Robin : Of all the women in New York,
Robin : you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?
Ted : Not what it sounds like.
Robin : You know that I hate her. How could you go out with this girl?
Ted : It wasn't a date.
Ted : She came over to the apartment looking for you.
Becky : I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies.
Becky : But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.
Becky : A spider!
UNK: Let me guess : she acted like a helpless little girl,
UNK: and you stepped in as the big, strong man.
Ted : I don't know if that's totally true.
UNK: It's okay, darlin'.
Becky : Poor spider.
Ted : Spiders gotta die,
Ted : so trees can grow.
Ted : Then I held her tight
Ted : and told her it was all gonna be okay.
Ted : By the way, I think I only wounded the spider.
Ted : It crawled off into my bedroom.
Robin : Is that why you slept on the couch last night?
Ted : I slept.
Barney : I'm dying out here.
Robin : Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.
Barney : Wow, lady.
UNK: You got some tig ol'bitties!
Barney : Gosh!
Barney : Your body's a perfect...
Barney : this many.
Barney : Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places?
Barney : Come on!
UNK: I need two seconds, baby.
Lily : I know you think that's a compliment, but I'd rather you took your time.
Marshall : I'll be right back.
Marvin : Ancient Norse wisdom tells us that, to sire a son,
Marvin : you must do three things right before you lay with your maiden.
Marvin : First, eat pickled herring.
Marvin : Eat it!
Marshall : This is ridiculous.
Announcer : Gentlemen, on the main stage, throwing her life away,
ANNOUNCER : give it up for Marshall's daughter!
UNK: Who's your granddaddy?
UNK: That guy.
Barney : Want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend?
Barney : His name's Otis.
Barney : Want to come to my house and play telephone?
UNK: I got the string, you got the cans.
