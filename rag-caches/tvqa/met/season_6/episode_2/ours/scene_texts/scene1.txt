Robin : Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.
UNK: But that is not the point. You broke the first rule
UNK: of setting people up : undersell.
UNK: It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid,
UNK: you don't say, "It's the greatest movie ever."
UNK: You say, "it's pretty good"
UNK: And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind.
UNK: Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, "Sweep the leg!"
UNK: And Daniel-san's all like...
Robin : Maybe I did oversell you a bit.
James : Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.
Lily : It gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson.
Lily : Like, look at this.
Lily : Who was a cute little basketball player
Lily : before he became the biggest pervert in the world?
Barney : I loved Pee Wee basketball.
Barney : Well, until they kicked me off the team...
Barney : I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit
Barney : because it wasn't fair to the other kids.
Marshall : That sounds plausible.
Barney : It's true.
Barney : Tell him, James.
James : Yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap.
James : He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside...
James : He sucked.
James : Coach cut him from the team, mom fed him that so he'd feel better.
Barney : Oh, my God! Look at this.
Barney : My letter from the Postmaster General.
UNK: I can't believe he took the time to write this...
UNK: "Dear Barney..."
UNK: I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations
Loretta : you sent out to your eighth birthday party.
UNK: That's why none of your classmates showed up.
UNK: Not because you threw up
UNK: when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium.
UNK: No one even noticed that.
UNK: Janey Masterson's mother is a whore,
UNK: and with gin on her breath at 10 : 00 in the morning,
UNK: she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool.
UNK: Love, Postmaster General.
James : Thank you.
UNK: - Does your mom make that up a lot? - Constantly.
James : She put more effort into some lies than others.
Barney : Mom? Who's my dad?
Barney : All the other kids at school know who their dad is.
Barney : Who's mine?
Loretta : I don't know.
Loretta : That guy.
Robin : Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?
James : I heard Flip Wilson,
James : Bill Cosby,
James : James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon...
James : The list goes on.
UNK: I can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is and Barney's no help.
James : He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up.
James : Not me. I caught on early.
Barney : Careful!
Barney : Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...
Ted : Damn.
Ted : Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.
Lily : She's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper,
Lily : his mom would suddenly decide he was "sick"
Lily : and give him cough medicine until he passed out.
Marshall : That's what stunted my growth.
Marshall : I hit 6'4" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.
Lily : And then there's the most popular parental lie in history.
Lily : Santa.
Marshall : That's a good lie.
Marshall : Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.
