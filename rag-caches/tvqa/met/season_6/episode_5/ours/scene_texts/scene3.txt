Ted : Look, she's really hot, okay?
Ted : Come on! Come on!
Ted : We all change a little for whoever we're into.
Ted : Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.
Barney : Asian girls love them some Jews.
Ted : And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.
Lily : I think you got that backwards there, Chief.
Marshall : And you're welcome.
Ted : The point is, you weren't pretending
Ted : to like the Indigo Girls for the other person.
Ted : You realized you liked them because of the other person.
Ted : Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian.
Ted : Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?
Barney : Technically, they were eggs.
Ted : - Did you just say "eggs"? - I don't recall saying "eggs."
Max : So I walk into my boss's office
Max : and suddenly I realize,
Max : "Holy crap, I'm about to quit".
UNK: Small penis.
UNK: You have a small penis.
UNK: That's super interesting, but you have a small penis.
UNK: Damn it, Marshall!
UNK: Think of any two words other than "small" or "penis".
UNK: Got it : small penis.
UNK: Damn it!
Robin : I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.
Max : Right now it's a pretty small practice.
Marshall : I bet it's not that small.
Max : Bro, it's pretty small.
UNK: But you know what they say. The important thing is how you use it.
Marshall : "The motion of the ocean". That whole thing.
UNK: He said it's small and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.
Marshall : I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks.
Marshall : And thick.
Max : Everything about it is tiny.
Max : The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny.
Max : Plus, I got a very small staff.
Robin : Let's order!
UNK: Ted from 2030 : As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey
UNK: Ted from 2030 : and tell her my true identity...
Ted : Zoey...
Ted : I'm Batman.
Ted : That'd be cool.
UNK: ... the strangest thing happened.
Zoey : I need your help.
Zoey : Just to warn you.
Zoey : What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal.
Ted : Wasn't expecting bunnies.
Zoey : I stole them.
Zoey : My animal rights group liberated these guys
Zoey : from an evil cosmetics company.
Zoey : And I figured, "Hey, Ted's a vet.
Zoey : He can check them out and make sure they're okay".
Ted : Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies.
Ted : Why would I say that?
Max : Well, I know what I'm getting.
Max : The porterhouse.
Max : I've had it here before.
Max : It is like this. It's huge.
Marshall : Spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me and get dessert.
Marshall : Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.
Max : Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me.
Max : - Excuse me. I'll be right back. - Totally.
Marshall : We'll just be here.
Marshall : You're great.
Max : Thanks, bro.
UNK: It's... it's going on a while.
Max : I know.
Max : Thanks.
Lily : Damn, baby, be cool!
Robin : You're acting like he has six months to live.
Marshall : It's your fault!
Marshall : You ladies and your salty sailor talk!
Robin : Come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?
Robin : Locker room talk.
Marshall : Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?
Marshall : It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes
Marshall : trying to get out of there as quickly as possible.
Marshall : And one old guy just letting it all hang out.
Lily : Are you suggesting
UNK: that guys don't talk about sex?
Marshall : Yes, we do, but you know what we say?
Marshall : "I hit that."
Marshall : "I got some."
Marshall : "I tapped it."
Marshall : "I squeezed those." Discreet and efficient.
Robin : Not to mention classy.
Marshall : Thank God that I'm not dating.
UNK: If Lily talked in that much detail about our sex life,
Marshall : I'd probably kill myself.
Marshall : - What did you tell her? - Practically nothing.
Lily : We don't talk about you!
Marshall : Are you sure?
Robin : That argument has no traction whatsoever.
UNK: You broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?
Zoey : Nah. I've been arrested lots of times.
