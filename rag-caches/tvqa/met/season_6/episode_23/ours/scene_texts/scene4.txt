Chairman : Right.
UNK: The chairman asks you...
Chairman : Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?
UNK: But before you can answer...
UNK: You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja
UNK: Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.
Robin : That one's less likely.
Robin : What I'm saying...
Robin : what I hate saying...
Robin : is this.
Robin : You and Zoey are gonna break up.
Robin : But you can still save your career
Robin : and Barney's.
Ted : Okay, first of all,
Ted : no ninja's getting a jump on me.
Ted : I have the reflexes of a jungle...
Lily : Tree?
Ted : Second of all,
Ted : I don't care that the odds are stacked against us.
Ted : I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey
Ted : than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds,
Ted : which, by the way, I've shown you how to download,
Ted : like, 20 times. I've got to say,
Lily : I'm with Ted on this.
Chairman : Thank you. I mean, yes,
Lily : this is a huge, divisive issue for them.
Lily : Which means no matter what happens,
Lily : there's gonna be a lot of resentment.
Lily : Probably lasting
Marshall : for years...
Lily : infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship.
Lily : So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.
Chairman : Thank you.
UNK: That night,
UNK: as I slept soundly...
Ted : Barney, what are you doing?
Ghost : Who is this Barney?
Ghost : My name is John Clifford Larrabee,
Ghost : architect of The Arcadian.
Ghost : And I am
Ghost : visiting you
Ghost : in a dream...
Ted : Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend
Ted : renting a costume and breaking into my apartment
Ted : in the middle of the night
Ted : for what I wish I could say was the first time.
UNK: Look, it's a dream, it is.
UNK: So just... okay?
Ghost : Theodore...
UNK: heed my words :
UNK: do not try to save The Arcadian.
Ted : Barney, there's condoms in the drawer.
Ted : Just take them and get out.
UNK: Ghost, shouting dramatically : I am not
Robin : Barney...
Ted : Whoa! Lighting change!
Ghost : Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built,
Ghost : architecturally unimportant rat's nest
Ghost : designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict
Ghost : with two thumbs.
Ghost : This guy.
Ted : Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building,
Ted : but... does that mean we have to knock it down?
Ted : I mean, it's not bothering anyone.
Ted : Just anyone who lives in it.
Ted : Or looks at it.
Ted : Or smells it.
Ghost : New York is never finished, Theodore.
Ghost : She's a lady
Ghost : only a handful of architects ever get to dance with.
Ghost : Do not miss
Ghost : your turn.
Ted : The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?
Ghost : Indeed.
Ted : You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.
Ghost : Mo' buildings, mo' problems.
Ted : This is a dream, right?
Ted : Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...
Ghost : Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.
UNK: Ted, panting : Dream! Dream!
UNK: Ted, panting : It was just a dream.
UNK: ? ?
UNK: Ted, panting : Hey. I know it's late, but, uh...
UNK: Ted, panting : you want to meet up?
Zoey : Hello, Mr. Lion.
Ted : "Look on my works,
Ted : ye mighty, and despair""
Zoey : Hey, I met you right...
UNK: Ted from 2030 : ...here.
Ted : Right. And I mistook you
Ted : for a prostitute right...
UNK: Ted from 2030 : here.
Zoey : As far as you know, I still could be one.
Audience : Ah. And you,
Zoey : my good man, have run up quite a tab.
Ted : Worth every penny.
Chairman : All right...
Zoey : this was fun.
Zoey : I'm gonna take this cab.
Zoey : Big day tomorrow.
Zoey : We need to get some sleep.
Zoey : And yet...
Ted : No, we should get some sleep.
Ted : But this was fun.
Zoey : Yeah.
Zoey : It's nice getting one last look
Zoey : to remember what we're trying to save.
Ted : Exactly.
Zoey : You okay?
Ted : Yeah. Good night.
UNK: Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time.
UNK: Should The Arcadian be a landmark?
Ted : No, it shouldn't be a landmark.
Ted : There are a lot
Ted : of important buildings in New York.
Ted : The Arcadian isn't one of them.
Zoey : E-Excuse me,
Zoey : I have a question for Mr. Mosby.
