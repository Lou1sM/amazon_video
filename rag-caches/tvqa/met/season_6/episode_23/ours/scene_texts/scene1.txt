Chairman : Mr. Mosby,
Chairman : do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?
Chairman : It's not a difficult question.
UNK: Actually, it was a difficult question.
UNK: Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier,
UNK: I would have immediately said...
UNK: "Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."
UNK: And then the crowd "Oh, my God!
UNK: "Did he really just say that?
UNK: "Oh, heavens!
UNK: "Oh, my stars!
UNK: I must clutch my pearls!"
Zoey : So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?
UNK: Almost exclusively. But here's my point :
UNK: If they ask GNB's chief architect-- aka me--
UNK: if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say "yes"?
Zoey : That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed;
Zoey : that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.
Marshall : I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.
Zoey : Yeah.
Zoey : The Arcadian's gonna be all like...
Marshall : Nice.
Robin : I have a message from Barney.
UNK: Things between Barney
UNK: and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty.
UNK: First this happened.
Zoey : Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.
UNK: And then this happened.
Zoey : What kind of dirtbag
Zoey : doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead,
Zoey : sides with some self-righteous bitch
Zoey : with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!
Ted : Dude! That's my girlfriend.
Ted : And ya know what?
Ted : I'm on her side now, too.
UNK: Which led to this happening.
Zoey : Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave.
Zoey : Good night, guys.
Zoey : - I love you. - Mmm. Love you, too.
Zoey : Good night. Good night.
Chairman : All right, what's the message?
Lily : 'Cause if it's another hypothetical
Lily : yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs . .
Robin : Yeah, I have that, too.
Lily : Damn it.
Robin : All right, here's the message.
Robin : "Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there.
UNK: "I was too busy feelin' fine and..."
Robin : Really?
Robin : "Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine."
UNK: "You may have noticed the giant plate
UNK: "of hot wings in front of me.
UNK: "I know how much you love hot wings.
UNK: "Too bad someone bribed the kitchen
UNK: "to take them off the menu tonight.
UNK: "So, if you want some,
UNK: "you're going to have to come back to GNB.
UNK: "But hurry, this offer
UNK: will be gone lickety-split."
UNK: "Do evil laugh."
Robin : Oh, um...
Robin : So, what are you turds up to?
Marshall : Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days.
Marshall : I have my whole presentation worked out.
Marshall : I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.
Ted : Why does it need to rhyme?
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Mm.
Marshall : If you end an argument with a rhyme,
UNK: it's convincing all the time. Yeah.
UNK: It's why in our apartment :
UNK: If you're a-hopin' to score,
UNK: don't leave your socks on the floor.
Marshall : And she hasn't since. No.
Barney : Okay, okay. A couple of things.
Barney : Lily, how'd I do? Nailed it.
Barney : Secondly, Ted,
Barney : I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey.
Barney : Are you really going to walk away from this project
Barney : just because you're mad at me?
Ted : It's not because I'm mad at you.
Ted : Barney, The Arcadian was designed
Ted : by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee.
Ted : And even though he's been dead for half a century,
Ted : it's my duty, architect to architect,
Ted : to keep his work alive.
Ted : Please tell me a little part of you understands.
Barney : I understand.
Barney : Zoey has magic lady bits. What?
Barney : Zoey's lady bits...
Barney : are magic, and that's how she controls your mind.
Barney : You see, every few hundred millennia,
Barney : lady bits leap forward... I know
Lily : you're only just getting started,
Lily : but this is already gross.
Barney : I once knew such a girl.
UNK: It was last call.
