UNK: There are certain moments in life when you have to decide
UNK: which things you can stand to see torn down,
UNK: and which things you have to preserve, no matter what.
UNK: Such a moment came for all of us
UNK: in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the
UNK: New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission,
UNK: Ted from 2030 : where the fate of The Arcadian
UNK: would be decided once and for all.
UNK: A symbol of strength and constancy,
UNK: the stone lion of The Arcadian
UNK: has watched over New Yorkers for generations.
UNK: So remember :
UNK: if the lion head stonework is regal,
UNK: then tearing it down should be illegal.
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Well...
UNK: Did you like that? All right, uh...
UNK: We must make sure the lion is always there.
UNK: Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare.
UNK: Yeah? Yeah? Okay.
UNK: Try this one on for size...
UNK: If you want New York's history at your beck and call...
Chairman : All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.
Marshall : I just have...
Chairman : We will now hear from the architect
Chairman : of the proposed GNB Tower,
Chairman : Ted Mosby.
Chairman : Now, uh,
Chairman : Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase.
Chairman : Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?
Chairman : Okay, it's killing me. What rhymes with "beck and call?"
Marshall : Wrecking ball.
Marshall : Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.
Audience : Ah...
Chairman : Thank you.
