Ted : Right?
Robin : What?
UNK: Ted from 2030 : So, Barney,
Cherryl : You have a pretty big job with a bank?
Ted : I do.
Barney : I make a ton of money.
Barney : How much do you make, JJ?
JJ : I'm 11.
Barney : Now we all know you make excuses.
Barney : I was talking about money.
Cherryl : Actually, JJ has a job. Tell him.
JJ : I got a paper route.
Barney : Good time to get into print media.
Barney : - Right, Dad? - Good slam, Barney.
Lily : Jerry.
Jerry : It's all good fun.
Jerry : Just ribbing among long lost brothers.
Cherryl : JJ's a heck of a basketball player.
Barney : You don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj.
Barney : Dad, check it.
Barney : Triceps.
Barney : What gym do you go to?
JJ : Fourth period?
Barney : Sounds like you're having your fourth period.
Barney : - Am I right, Dad?! - Got him again.
Jerry : Uh, maybe that's enough.
Barney : Why? JJ started it. What does JJ even stand for anyway?
Barney : Jerky... Jerkface?
Jerry : JJ stands for Jerome Jr.
Jerry : Jerome Jr...
Barney : He's named after you.
Barney : Excuse me.
JJ : I like having a brother.
UNK: You add too much water to oatmeal.
Marshall : I drown the son of a bitch.
Robin : You consistently miss at least one belt loop.
Marshall : It's like I'm blind.
Lily : You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.
Marshall : Guys... my dad just died.
Lily : Honey.
Marshall : No, I'm just kidding. This is great.
Marshall : I really, I really missed this.
Jerry : What is going on?
Barney : - This is mine. - I don't understand.
Barney : JJ gets a childhood, a dad,
UNK: a real family and a basketball hoop?
Barney : No. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.
Jerry : Come down and talk to me.
Barney : Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay?
Barney : You're just some lame suburban dad.
UNK: So why are you so mad?
Barney : If you were gonna be some lame suburban dad,
Barney : why couldn't you have been that for me?!
Jerry : I know I screwed up.
Barney : "Screwed up" doesn't even begin to describe...
Jerry : I know, I know!
Jerry : I want to fix this, and I don't know how!
Jerry : Tell me what I can do! I'll do anything!
Jerry : You're never gonna get it down like that.
Jerry : Just put the pointy end into the grooves.
Jerry : That's it. Now turn it.
Jerry : Righty tighty, lefty loosey.
Jerry : I have no good excuse, Barney.
Jerry : It took me years
Jerry : before I was even able to look myself in the mirror
Jerry : for the way I let you down.
Jerry : It took courage to send me that letter.
Jerry : More courage than I've ever had.
Jerry : I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I...
Jerry : I just have no idea where to begin.
Barney : Can you help me with this?
Jerry : Here, got it.
Jerry : Look, if you...
Jerry : ever feel like you're ready,
Jerry : I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.
Robin : Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?
Barney : I'm fine.
UNK: Buddy?
UNK: You, still want a basketball hoop out there?
Ted : I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea.
Barney : You were right.
Barney : A kid needs a hoop.
