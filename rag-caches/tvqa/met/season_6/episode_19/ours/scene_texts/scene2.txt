Robin : Please, no.
Scott : So this really sucks,
Scott : but I'm going to be in the North Pole for three months.
Robin : Seriously? The North Pole?
Robin : If you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight.
Robin : Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.
Scott : I'm going to be studying the mating habits of...
Robin : Of who?

Robin : You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott.

Robin : It works its way up to Candyland, and then, congratulate me,

Robin : I still think about him in the shower.
