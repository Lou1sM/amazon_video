Marshall : At our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.
Ted : Barney's dad.
Jerry : You're Barney's friends, right?
Marshall : Aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?
Robin : What?
Jerry : I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains.
Jerry : And I need your help. Barney won't return my calls.
Lily : Barney won't return your calls?
Lily : He said you two had an amazing night together.
Jerry : That's not what happened.
UNK: Jerry Barney's dad : I'm not sure how to start this.
Barney : I need a drink.
Jerry : Me, too.
Both : - Glen McKenna, neat. - Milk, skim.
Barney : Milk?
Barney : You're taking it easy. Crazy night?
Jerry : I'll say.
Jerry : Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.
UNK: I think it was the chili dog.
UNK: I had to take four Tums.
UNK: I was up till, like, 9 : 30.
UNK: When I was a kid, you were a roadie.
Barney : You still do that?
Jerry : I switched lanes years ago.
Jerry : I should explain. I'm a driving instructor.
UNK: Now you get it, right?
Barney : I get it.
Barney : But when I was a kid, you were this total badass.
Barney : I know.
Jerry : I was a real hard partier.
Barney : Now we're getting to the good stuff.
Jerry : The drugs, the alcohol, the women...
Jerry : - I was out of control. - Out of control
Jerry : So when your mom said I couldn't see you anymore,
Jerry : it was rock bottom for me.
Jerry : I'm so sorry.
Barney : You ever bang Stevie Nicks?
Jerry : Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool.
Jerry : And I was so desperate to connect with him,
Jerry : I did something I'm not proud of.
UNK: I started bragging.
Jerry : I bet you didn't know this about me,
Jerry : but I've published two nonfiction books about Asparagus.
Jerry : And one fiction.
Jerry : I'm credited with inventing the word "furgling."
Jerry : It means fumbling for keys.
Jerry : So then all the county fair judges started chanting,
Jerry : "More quiche! More quiche!"
Jerry : I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.
Jerry : I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man,
Ted : so...
Jerry : What a hottie, huh?
Jerry : I'm sure you're a real player.
Jerry : Big-time.
Jerry : Observe.
Jerry : Excuse me, that's my son over there.
Jerry : I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years.
Jerry : Would you just write down any seven numbers here,
Jerry : so that I can impress him?
Jerry : Please, I'm desperate.
Barney : My God, you're a natural.
Barney : Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo.
Barney : There's the "Father Knows Breast,"
Barney : there's the "Bush Dynasty," the "Lick Father, Lick Son."
Jerry : I couldn't do that.
Barney : - Why? - I have a family now.
Jerry : That's my wife, Cheryl,
Jerry : my daughter Carly, she's in college.
Jerry : This is my son JJ.
Jerry : I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.
Barney : You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute.
UNK: I gotta get going, Jerry, but...
Barney : This was great. Glad we did this.
Jerry : I made him wait all these years for me and...
Jerry : I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be.
