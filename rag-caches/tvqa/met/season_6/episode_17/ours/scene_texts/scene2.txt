Robin : So, Barney,
Robin : I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.
Barney : I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.
Robin : Not according to her.
Nora : My God, this was so much fun.
Nora : - We have to do this again. - We do, we have to.
UNK: - Wanna grab a drink right now? - No, I'm kind of tired, but...
Nora : This is my number, give me a call.
Barney : Absolutely.
Robin : - How is that a disaster? - She didn't want to get drinks.
Barney : And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...
UNK: - Wanna grab a drink right now? - No, I'm kind of tired.
Barney : Absolutely.
