Robin : with the innocence of a child?
Robin : - Innocence of a child. - Coming up. Here we go.
Man : Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got
Man : to use multiplication.
Man : To the joystick!
Man : Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply!
Man : Five times six?
UNK: Robin Sparkles : 30.
Man : Seven times four?
UNK: Jessica Glitter : - 28! - Keep going!
Man : Eight times nine?
UNK: Jessica Glitter : - 72! - Don't stop now!
Man : Almost there!
Man : 23 times three?
Robin : I'm sorry.
Barney : We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island,
Barney : and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like,
Barney : seaweed on her and a seashell bra.
Barney : You all feel me?
Lily : If you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?
Robin : It was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card
Robin : from her every year, but, we're not really friends anymore.
Lily : But BFFs are forever.
Marshall : Come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.
Ted : - I'm still friends with Punchy. - Dude, he lives in Cleveland.
Marshall : You see him once a year, at which point,
Marshall : he punches you really hard in the arm
Marshall : and tells everyone how you dookied your pants.
Marshall : I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.
Ted : Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter.
Marshall : Observe.
Punchy : - Schmosby! - Punchy!
Punchy : - Good talking to you. - You, too.
Ted : - If you're ever in New York. - Definitely.
Ted : We are just two peas.
Lily : I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends?
Lily : Best friends don't do that.
UNK: We did. And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it.
Robin : I got to go.
Lily : What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?
Ted : Much like our friends, the Space Teens,
Ted : I think I can solve this crime
Ted : with math.
Ted : Here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin.
Ted : - How old would you say that kid is? - Four years, three months.
Ted : Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago, right around the time
Ted : - she and Robin stopped being friends. - Of course. Robin hates kids.
UNK: The last thing she would wanna do is hang out with some little brat.
Ted : Thus, if I may...
Ted : When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear,
Ted : Robin said,
UNK: "To hell with this, I'm outta hare."
Ted : Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.
Marshall : That's got to be it, right, Lil?
Lily : Robin's gonna dump me!
Marshall : Sweetheart.
Ted : When a second uterus plumped becomes...
Robin : Dude.
Marshall : Feel the room.
Ted : We've been waiting all day!
Robin : Just watch it without me.
Barney : Two dudes on the couch together watching porn? That's kind of weird.
UNK: It's not porn, it's a kids' show.
Ted : Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.
Robin : Fine, I'll watch it with you. But if either of you makes
Robin : even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.
Robin : I'm serious.
UNK: Robin Sparkles : Jessica, how's your beaver?
UNK: Jessica Glitter : Great. How's your beaver?
UNK: Robin Sparkles : Busy as ever!
Robin : Our characters had pet beavers.
Ted : Sure.
Robin : The beaver is the official animal of Canada.
Robin : It's our national mascot.
Barney : It's a noble creature.
Man : Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood.
