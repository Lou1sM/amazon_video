Robin : off my ass.
Barney : Sorry, sorry.
LILY : What do you mean, you're going to say yes?
Marshall : I-I want to keep working at GNB.
Lily : But I thought that you...
UNK: Guys, guys, guys?
UNK: Architecture fun fact :
UNK: If you stand right here, and you whisper,
UNK: a person all the way across the other end of the room
UNK: hears it like you're standing right next to them.
UNK: It's one of the most sophisticated pieces
UNK: of acoustical design in the world. Watch.
whispers : Diarrhea.
UNK: Right? Right?
Lily : But a five-year contract.
Lily : I thought you hated GNB.
Marshall : Look, I don't hate all of it.
Marshall : Tonight's fun.
Marshall : Take a look around.
Marshall : I mean, this is pretty high-class.
whispers : Poo-poo.
UNK: Ted, whispering : Poo-poo platter.
Ted : Zoey?
Ted : Well, well, well.
Zoey : You have got to be kidding me.
Ted : So, what are we protesting tonight?
Ted : Rising cost of jet fuel?
Ted : The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?
Zoey : And what are you doing here?
Zoey : Oh, right.
Zoey : Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down.
Zoey : Can I finish my drink first?
George : Darling, there you are.
Ted : Hi. Hi.
Zoey : Ted, this is my husband.
Ted : Yeah, old stuff's great.
Robin : Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?
Barney : This is ridiculous.
Barney : We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection
Barney : of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere,
Barney : and look at what we're doing.
Robin : You're right.
Barney : Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?
Robin : Yeah, I do.
Ted : So, Captain.
Ted : How'd you get that name, anyway?
George : Gave it to myself.
George : A real man chooses his own name.
Ted : Well, pleased to meet you, Captain.
Ted : I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.
Zoey : This is Ted. Capital.
George : Honey, I may cut out early.
George : I have to go check up on the boat.
Ted : The boat? There's a boat?
Ted : You must tell me about this boat, Captain.
George : Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.
Ted : She! Do you like boats?
George : Does the sea call to you like it calls to me?
Ted : Yes. The sea is all like, "Ted, come hang out."
George : I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.
George : You're coming on the boat sometime.
George : Stepping off.
Ted : Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.
Zoey : Oh. You want to make this personal?
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Okay.
Zoey : Destroy Ted Mosby.
Zoey : Now it's personal.
Ted : No, if I wanted to make it personal,
Ted : I'd call you a bored little trophy wife
Ted : who likes to play activist
