Marshall : Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.
Randy : It's not fraud. I'm asking you to get me a lot of money
Randy : to not work here and not tell anyone about it.
Marshall : Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...
Randy : Come on, Arthur can't remember that.
UNK: Arthur, entering the room : What a memorable talk we had yesterday.
UNK: Arthur, entering the room : On behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry.
UNK: Arthur, entering the room : And I want to assure you you will never be fired again.
UNK: Arthur, entering the room : You're going to work here until you die!
UNK: Arthur, entering the room : Green tie?
UNK: Arthur, entering the room : Nice choice.
Randy : Thanks. It brings out my eyes.
Arthur : I'll bring out your eyes.
Marshall : Listen, Randy, I'm sorry,
Marshall : but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil.
Marshall : I will not let GNB change me.
Marshall : I will never fire anyone again ever.
Randy : We'll see about that.
Barney : Anyhoo, while I got you, big smile.
Barney : "We care about making dreams come true", in three, two...
Ted : What?
Randy : Are you unhappy with my performance?
Randy : Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.
Marshall : No, it's actually...
Marshall : nice having some of this clutter off my desk.
Randy : And there's more.
UNK: I dunno what I'll use this for, but it's great.
