Man : Isn't that right, Tugboat? Yeah.
Marshall : Okay, get that camera out of my face
Marshall : before I flip you like a cheese omelet.
Barney : All you have to do is say,
Barney : "I care about making dreams come true."
Marshall : First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker
Marshall : and saying it makes me feel like a hooker.
Barney : Everyone is in this video.
Barney : Randy's in the video.
Randy : I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes,
Randy : I only threw up thrice.
Marshall : Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?
Randy : I did.
Randy : I sent them downtown.
UNK: Why are you saying it like that? They never arrived at the downtown office.
UNK: Ted from 2030 : They...
Randy : To make sure we're on the same page, is "send them downtown"
Randy : not an expression for shredding a document?
Marshall : You shredded them?
Randy : I sent them downtown.
Randy : You know, down into the shredder.
Randy : You feed the paper
Randy : in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from.
Marshall : That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!
Randy : I can fix this. I am all over this project.
UNK: I'll say this, there is no quit in that guy.
UNK: - You should fire him. - Okay, that, that right there.
Marshall : That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video.
Marshall : Because GNB doesn't care.
Marshall : They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oeuvres.
Marshall : Last week, I was talking to Arthur...
Arthur : You're wearing a green tie now.
Arthur : I'm wearing a green tie.
Marshall : GNB treats people like they're disposable,
Marshall : and I will not be a part of that.
Marshall : Marshall Eriksen
Marshall : does not fire people, period.
Randy : Just want you to know, we are making good progress on this new project.
Randy : You gentlemen keep talking, I will answer that.
