Robin : And I think they're about your dad.
UNK: - I don't wanna talk about it, okay? - Why not?
Barney : Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you?
UNK: You're the most secretive one I know. You never tell anybody anything.
Lily : I've never... told anyone this before.
UNK: I was 16.
UNK: I was awakened around midnight
UNK: by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner,
UNK: Andy Grenier.
UNK: As things grew heated...
UNK: I watched my father's hand
UNK: slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk.
UNK: The sun was just starting to rise
UNK: over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down
UNK: with the flats of our shovels.
UNK: My dad and I got our stories straight.
UNK: We walked back to the house in silence and...
UNK: haven't talked about it since.
Ted : But sometimes...
UNK: on a still night...
UNK: you can still hear that clock,
Lily : ticking...
Lily : ticking...
Lily : ticking.
Crowd : That's...

Barney : Is it true?
Robin : But it did get you to drink three scotches,

Barney : Fine!
Barney : The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB
UNK: Ted from 2030 : is...
UNK: Ted from 2030 : is...
Barney : The meatball sub.
Barney : It all started months ago in the GNB commissary.
Barney : It was Meatball Sub Day.
UNK: How I used to love Meatball Sub Day.
UNK: And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.
Marshall : Buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.
