Barney : Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?
Barney : Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.
Robin : Or maybe he was.
Robin : Think about it.
Robin : The way that she bats her eyelashes
Robin : and shakes her tail feathers in his face?
Robin : She wants it.
Lily : Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of this?
Ted : Of course you feel that way.
Ted : You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob.
Ted : And that's fine for you guys.
Ted : But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.
Lily : You guys are in screaming matches all the time.
Ted : Growing matches.
UNK: It was true, Zoey and I loved to challenge each other.
