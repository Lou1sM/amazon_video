Marshall : Mom. Dad.
Marshall : What are you doing here?
UNK: We hadn't heard from you in two days. We were worried about you.
Marvin : For God's sake. Do you have any sixes?
Marshall : Go fish.
Marshall : Excuse me.
Marshall : Can I just talk to you in here for a minute?
Lily : Isn't it great? They just showed up.
Lily : Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen,
Lily : organized my closet
Lily : and she asked me if I lost height.
Lily : Not weight. Height.
Marshall : I'm very excited that they're here, too.
Marshall : But right now, I have to get excited about something else.
Lily : Okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents.
Lily : And you handle your, well...
Lily : Wait, Marshall.
Marshall : Thank you, baby. You're the best.
Judy : I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer.
Judy : It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine?
UNK: Me in a two-piece
Judy : bathing suit at my age?
Judy : Just picture it!
UNK: Picture it!
Marvin : That's why Fred Cox
Marvin : is the greatest kicker the Vikings ever had.
UNK: Seriously, Marshall, picture it.
UNK: Just picture it.
UNK: Give me a <i>C. Give me an </i>O. Give me an X.
Marvin : What's that spell?
Marvin : Cox! Cox!
Ted : Okay, I did a bad thing last night.
Ted : - I looked up his address. - Who?
Ted : Sorry. You said "who."
Ted : It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius.
Woman : Sandy. How dare he laugh at you.
Ted : Who does he think...
Ted : Sorry. "Who."
Ted : Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.
Robin : God. Tell me you didn't go over there.
Ted : I just thought...
Ted : he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.
Robin : God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists.
Ted : They're my feet. I'm more of a kicker.
Ted : So I went to his apartment.
Sandy : You're not the pizza guy.
Robin : Oh, my God. This is...
Ted : This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again.
Ted : I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice.
Ted : So new advice.
Ted : Steer into Sandy, and run him down.
Robin : If people found out Sandy wears a toupee...
Ted : Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?
Robin : No. He's very open about that.
Robin : That's Gregory.
Robin : Nice guy.
Judy : And the top is so low-cut.
Judy : Your father says he has
Judy : front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins.
Judy : By the way, Marshall, we do need to know
Judy : if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming?
Judy : Marshall, are you coming?
Marshall : This isn't working.
Marvin : - Where you going, son? - I'm going to...
Marshall : I'm going to...
UNK: Kids, to this day,
UNK: your uncle Marshall is thankful for what Lily said next.
UNK: He's going to masturbate.
UNK: Marshall, tell them what's going on.
UNK: And so Marshall told his parents everything.
UNK: Now, I'm scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild.
Judy : We don't care about that one bit.
Judy : And if you guys want kids,
Judy : there are other ways. Adoption.
Judy : Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm?
Marshall : Maybe adoption.
Marvin : What I'm saying is,
Marvin : we love you no matter what.
Marvin : Why don't you pretend you're in high school,
Marvin : get back in that bathroom,
Marvin : and "blow dry your hair."
