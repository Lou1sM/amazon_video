UNK: Kids, when Lily and Marshall started trying to have a baby,
UNK: they went a little crazy.
Lily : We've been trying and trying,
Lily : and still nothing's happened.
Lily : I'm just worried we can't have children.
Doctor : - And how long have you been trying? - Six days.
UNK: But then, months went by, and still nothing happened.
Lily : Something must be wrong.
Lily : We're doing it a lot.
Marshall : And everywhere...
Marshall : the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room,
Marshall : outside in your wait... the kitchen.
Lily : Seriously, Doc,
Lily : why isn't this happening?
Doctor : Look, if you're really worried,
Doctor : here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel.
Doctor : He's the best in the city.
