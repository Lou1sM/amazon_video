Lily : Well, you're a big...
Lily : stupid octopus face!
UNK: That was it! I remember now!
Lily : Wow. Thanks, Barney.
Barney : You saved me.
Barney : You saved us.
Lily : If there's one thing you never do,
Lily : it's call a woman "fat" right to her face!
Barney : I'm sorry, Lily.
Barney : Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
Marshall : Oh...
Lily : You're a jerk.
UNK: Barney chuckles
Barney : Hey. Hey, wait.
Barney : Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait!
Barney : There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory.
Barney : A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become
Barney : a mermaid again through one simple act.
Lily : What's that?
Barney : Breast-feeding. Hot.
Lily : Really?
Ted : Really.
Barney : When those things swell up to three times their normal size...
Barney : so do I.
Lily : That's so sweet!
UNK: See kids? Told you I'd get it!
Ted : Okay, now we're even!
UNK: Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story.
UNK: We'll get there.
Captain : So you really thought I was gonna kill you?
Ted : Well... ish.
Captain : Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous.
Captain : If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge.
Captain : It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have
Captain : to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.
Ted : See? It's stuff like that.
Ted : Why-why do you talk that way?
Captain : Oh, I'm just jesting for sport.
Captain : See, sometimes I don't bond as well
Captain : with Zoey's younger friends.
Captain : But I know she really likes you.
Captain : I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.
Ted : We can.
Ted : We can be buddies.
Ted : Just not on a boat.
Captain : Fair enough.
Captain : The hunting lodge it is.
UNK: Ho-ho-ho!
slurring : You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation
UNK: Robin, slurring : and just focused on the drinking...
UNK: Robin, slurring : I had fun.
Marshall : Yeah, me, too.
UNK: And then a terrible thing happened.
UNK: Marshall's beer goggles kicked in
UNK: and his very drunk mind started to see...
Marshall : No... No, no!
Robin : No! No,
Marshall : don't turn!
Lily : Uh-oh.
Robin : I don't feel so good.
UNK: vomits
Robin : Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry!
Robin : Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.
Marshall : I really do.
UNK: And from that moment on
UNK: Marshall never worried
UNK: about Robin becoming a mermaid again,
UNK: and the two of them were closer than ever.
UNK: There you go.
Zoey : Hey, Ted.
Ted : Hey. You feeling better?
Zoey : I have a confession to make.
Zoey : I wasn't really sick.
Ted : You weren't?
Lily : I'm sorry.
Zoey : I was just feeling guilty
Zoey : that I lied to The Captain and...
Zoey : I don't know, I just thought it would be good
Zoey : if you two spent some time together.
Ted : I get it.
Ted : And you were right.
Ted : He's a nice guy.
Ted : I mean, he can be a little scary.
Zoey : Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous.
Ted : Yeah, he's a creepy dude.
Ted : But I like him.
Ted : And I just want to make sure
Ted : you and I hanging out
Ted : doesn't, you know, cross any lines.
Marshall : Me, too.
Ted : I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint
Ted : of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out.
Ted : You don't, do you?
Zoey : No. Do you?
Marshall : No.
UNK: clock ticking
UNK: Sailor #1 : Still no sign of land.
UNK: Sailor #2 : It's been 243 days since we've seen
UNK: Sailor #2 : another living soul.
UNK: Sailor #2 : What are you looking at?
UNK: Sailor #1 : Dude, we need to find land.
