Nate : I like you guys.
Marshall : If you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.
Robin : What?
Robin : You told me to meet someone.
Marshall : I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice,
Marshall : but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.
Robin : Actually, I met him in the park.
Ted : Should have just let you get a dog.
Barney : I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second?
UNK: So, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.
Lily : And you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?
Lily : Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?
Lily : Okay, fine.
Lily : On one condition.
Lily : You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora.
Lily : She seems like something special.
Barney : Okay, I promise I won't lie to her.
UNK: I may, however, lie "on" her.
Barney : I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.
UNK: The cardiologist : Are we done?
UNK: The cardiologist : - Barney, your heart sounds fine. - See, Lily?
Barney : She was worried.
UNK: The cardiologist : Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia.
Lily : Nails, nails!
UNK: The cardiologist : It's probably nothing to worry about,
UNK: The cardiologist : but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.
Barney : Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.
UNK: The cardiologist : Don't worry. It's totally safe.
UNK: The cardiologist : Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.
Barney : Now it doesn't.
UNK: And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results.
UNK: The cardiologist : Everything looks fine here,
UNK: The cardiologist : although I did notice a few irregularities.
UNK: The cardiologist : There's nothing to be...
UNK: The cardiologist : alarmed about.
Barney : Go on, Doctor.
UNK: What happened at 8 : 46 p.m. last night?
Barney : Well, let's see...
UNK: Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups...
Barney : I was at dinner.
Nora : This might be a little forward,
Nora : but do you have a bomb strapped to your chest?
Barney : This? No, no.
Barney : It's a heart monitor.
Barney : It's a medical thing.
Nora : I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.
Barney : What's that like?
Nora : So is everything okay?
Barney : My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack.
Barney : So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.
Nora : Oh, I am so sorry.
Nora : Barney, what I'm about to say
Nora : is going to sound a little weird,
Nora : but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.
Barney : For what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked.
Barney : Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just...
Barney : What is it?
Nora : I want to get married.
Nora : I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily.
Nora : But that's what I want.
Nora : And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now.
Nora : I want a family, and I want to live in a little house
Nora : with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb.
Nora : And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side,
Nora : and wake up next to him in the morning every morning
Nora : for the rest of our lives.
Nora : Just thought you should know that.
Lily : You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!
Barney : That's exactly what I want, too.
UNK: I love gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes.
Nate : Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, "get out of here!"
Nate : They run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, they're back.
Nate : And I'm like, "get out of here!"
Nate : So annoying.
Nate : I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen?
Robin : Okay, but...
