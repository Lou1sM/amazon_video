Barney : your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?
Lily : Mr. Buttons?
Lily : You son of a bitch.
Lily : Fine. I'll be nice.
Barney : - Marshall? - You got nothing on me.
Barney : - The calzone? - Checkmate.
Robin : Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream,
Robin : The Mr. T dream...
Ted : Go ahead. Give me your best.
Ted : My life's an open book.
Barney : The ballet class.
Ted : I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.
Barney : The 'N Sync concert.
Ted : 1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row.
Ted : Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?
Barney : The thermos.
Ted : I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.
Barney : I do!
Barney : So be cool!
UNK: There's a man who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.
Robin : Sorry, toots. He's taken.
Nora : - So. How do you all know Barney? - I don't know how we know Barney.
Lily : How does anyone know how they know anyone?
Lily : I like your pretty hair, help me.
Marshall : We did not meet him at a strip club.
Marshall : No, sir. Because...
Marshall : Barney don't go to no strip clubs.
Nora : Come on. Barney's been to a strip club once.
Ted : - Once? - Thermos.
Ted : Nope. Not even once.
Ted : Really?
Nora : So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy.
Lily : I don't recall.
Marshall : I think that we're done here,
Marshall : I think that we have adequately established that Barney is
Marshall : the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents.
Marshall : Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?
Nora : It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town.
Nora : They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow.
Nora : Do you want to meet them?
UNK: This was a big deal for Barney.
Barney : I only have one rule.
Barney : Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.
Ted : Not even if she's hot?
Barney : Not even if her mom's hot.
Barney : I'd love to meet your parents.
Nora : It's a date.
Nora : We should get going. Walk me home?
Nate : Walk? Somebody say walk? I love a good walk.
UNK: No, Scooby, you stay!
Robin : I got called back in to work.
Robin : Can you keep an eye on him until I get back?
Robin : He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.
Ted : I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.
Nora : Good night.
Nate : What do we do now?
Nate : I got an idea. I was in the park today, and this guy sold me a big bag of...
UNK: Kids, it was a big bag of sandwiches.
Marshall : - Put that away. - Wanna fire these up?
Lily : Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.
Ted : - Sandwich brownies? - Okay.
Marshall : Sandwiches make me hungry.
Ted : Truth.
Ted : I have a question.
Ted : What did Barney mean when he said
Ted : "calzone"?
Marshall : Okay, I'll tell you.
Marshall : One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk,
Marshall : pick it up, and then keep eating it.
Marshall : It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...
Ted : Dude. Listen to me.
Ted : You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Ted : That calzone sounds amazing.
Lily : Guys, I found this on the floor.
Ted : Scooby ate the whole tray.
Ted : Wait. Where is he, anyway?
Ted : Dude.
Lily : Scooby got out!
Nora : Here we are.
Nora : I had a really great time tonight.
Barney : Yeah, me, too.
UNK: Do you wanna come upstairs?
Nate : I'd love to.
Barney : There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but...
UNK: I don't wanna get married. I've been saying that to get in your pants.
Barney : Can you believe...
Lily : I found Scooby's wallet.
