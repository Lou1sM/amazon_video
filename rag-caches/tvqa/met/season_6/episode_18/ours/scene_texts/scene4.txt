Marshall : That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.
UNK: Ted, on the phone with Robin : Remember Scooby? Well, he got out.
Robin : What do you mean?
Ted : He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.
Marshall : - It wasn't me. - Me neither.
Lily : He must've figured out how to open it himself.
Ted : He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.
Marshall : I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.
Robin : Guys, get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby.
Robin : - I'm on my way home. - Wait wait!
Ted : Can you pick up some calzones?
Barney : Nora, wait. Wait.
Barney : I'm sorry I misled you.
Nora : Misled?
Nora : You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!
Barney : - I was on the spot. This is your fault. - My fault?
Barney : With the whole "I wanna get married" thing.
Barney : You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship.
Barney : This... isn't England.
Ted : - Great idea. - No, great idea!
Lily : If you were new in town
Lily : and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?
Marshall : Of course.
Marshall : Back to the pizza place!
Ted : - Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went. - Who's Scooby?
Robin : - Hey, guys. - Hey, have you seen Scooby?
UNK: Isn't him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?
Nate : It's my friends!
UNK: And that explains 12 : 51 a.m.
UNK: Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue.
UNK: Your heart's fine.
UNK: With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life.
UNK: If nobody stabs you.
Lily : Day's not over.
Barney : I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.
Lily : No, that wasn't the lie.
Lily : The lie was when you told Nora you were lying.
Lily : Because you weren't.
Lily : You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.
Barney : Maybe, eventually, I could settle down.
Barney : 50 years from now,
Barney : if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins.
Barney : But those twins
Barney : won't even be born for another...
Barney : 32 years.
Nora : I mean...
Barney : Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...
Lily : - What time was your dinner reservation? - Last night? 8 : 30.
UNK: What did his heart do at 8 : 30?
UNK: It... literally skipped a beat.
Lily : Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it?
Barney : I lied.
Barney : When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.
Nora : - I'm confused. - So am I.
Barney : This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but,
Barney : I know it's what I want. I want to be confused.
Lily : With you.
Nora : Mom, Dad...
Nora : This is Barney.
Barney : I'm Barney. Great to meet you.
UNK: You wanna see a magic trick?
