Marshall : So Ted's in love with Zoey
Marshall : and Zoey's in love with Ted?
UNK: Well, that's not gonna work. I gotta call Ted.
UNK: Listen, Ted, I gotta tell you something about Zoey.
Ted : I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.
UNK: I wasnear by and I thought of that beer you're about to offer me.
Ted : Can I get you a beer?
Zoey : I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one.
Zoey : Lead the way.
Zoey : What?!
Zoey : Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you?
Ted : What?
Ted : Listen, Zoey, I...
Ted : I need to tell you something.
Judy : I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything?
Marshall : Get off the phone!
UNK: - Could you get some Bugles, please? - Of course, dear.
Marshall : Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up!
Marshall : And we need ice cream.
Zoey : Go on.
Ted : I can't be friends with you anymore.
Ted : And this may seem strange, but,
Ted : you can't ask me why.
Ted : And that was it. No more Zoey.
Marshall : Buddy, that's Lily. I should take that.
UNK: Ted from 2030 : But... you're a good guy, Ted.
Lily : We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.
Marshall : Ted's a son of a bitch!
Marshall : Nice.
UNK: But... baby?
Marshall : Go easy on Ted, okay? He just ended things with Zoey.
Robin : I know. But did he tell you the whole story?
Ted : I can't be friends with you anymore.
Ted : And you can't ask me why.
Zoey : Why?
Ted : Lily hates you.
Zoey : You hate me?
Lily : That's crazy. I don't hate you.
Zoey : Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything.
Lily : Really?
Lily : And what did Ted say, exactly?
Ted : Lily hates you.
Ted : She hates you so much
Ted : it's hard to be around you.
Ted : So we can't be friends.
Lily : I guess there's no use hiding it anymore.
Lily : I hate you.
Marshall : Bitch.
Zoey : I can't believe it.
Zoey : I really thought you and I were friends.
Zoey : Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been...
Zoey : going through some pretty difficult stuff.
Marshall : Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?
Lily : - I don't know. - Well, you did the right thing, baby.
Lily : Not entirely.
Lily : Zoey, wait!
Lily : I don't hate you!
Lily : We just can't be friends anymore because...
Lily : Robin hates you.
Marshall : And that's Robin on the other line.
Lily : Well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!
Marshall : Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking. Listen, Robin,
Marshall : I know, I apologize for my wife. She never should have...
Robin : I told Zoey you hate her.
Zoey : Me? You dragged me into this?!
Robin : You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...
Marshall : That's my other line.
Marshall : It's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!
Robin : - Just don't answer it. - I can't not answer. It's impolite.
Robin : - You can beat this. - I can't turn my back on politeness.
Marshall : - Good manners are what separate us... - You can just let it ring.
UNK: - ... from those Wisconsinites. - I believe in you.
