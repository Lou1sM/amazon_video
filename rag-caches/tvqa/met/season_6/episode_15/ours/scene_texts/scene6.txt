Barney : why else would he let 30 years go by?
Barney : He's ashamed to have me as a son.
Honey : Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you.
Honey : He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you.
Honey : You're do so great without him.
Honey : I mean, you have an airline and
Honey : three Nobel Prizes,
Honey : and you play for the Yankees.
Barney : Four. Four Nobel Prizes.
Barney : Four.
Honey : See? That is impressive.
Honey : How many does he have?
Barney : Only three.
Honey : There you go.
Marshall : Listen, Honey, while I've got you,
Marshall : do you have any idea what kind of
Zoey : difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?
Honey : I can't tell you about that.
Honey : The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.
Marshall : I am her therapist.
Honey : Well, in that case...
Marshall : Okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today.
UNK: I gotta go. Bye.
Zoey : What's this really about?
Ted : I told you. Lily hates you.
Zoey : I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me,
Zoey : and you're too chicken to come out and say it.
Zoey : All right.
Lily : I... hate you.
Honey : Great.
Honey : See?
Zoey : Was that so hard?
Zoey : Can you at least tell me why?
Zoey : Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought...
Zoey : I just want to know why.
Marshall : So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey.
Marshall : Zoey has no idea.
Marshall : Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney,
Marshall : and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?
Marcus : Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know.
Marshall : So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other,
Marshall : which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard.
Marshall : I mean, The Captain.
Marshall : Except now, as Honey informs me...
Ted : And we miss you.
Ted : But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.
UNK: Fine, I will make it happen.
Marshall : Good-bye.
Zoey : I guess I'll take it.
Marshall : Zoey and The Captain...
Marshall : are getting divorced.
Marshall : Which means...?
Marcus : So help me, Marshall,
Marcus : if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids,
Zoey : I will.
Marshall : Give me that phone.
Ted : Why do I hate you? Are you kidding?
Ted : You're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream.
Ted : So there's that. Plus,
UNK: you're stubborn and argumentative.
Ted : And what kind of name is Zoey, huh?
Ted : What is that, short for Zoseph?
Ted : Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second.
Zoey : Yes, I am.
Zoey : Yes, I am.
Zoey : He is?
Ted : - Why was Marshall calling? - Don't worry about it. Go on.
Ted : You talk during movies.
Ted : You sneeze with your whole body.
Ted : To my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.
Zoey : Well, actually...
UNK: I speak a little Portuguese.
Ted : You're a show-off.
Zoey : You better take that.
Ted : Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with...
Ted : She is?
Ted : She is?
UNK: Marshall, I gotta go.
Neighbour : - They're kissing. - They're kissing?!
Marshall : They're kissing!
UNK: They're kissing, Mom! They're kissing!
