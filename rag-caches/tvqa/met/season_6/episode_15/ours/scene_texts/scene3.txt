Barney : Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable phones.
Barney : I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one.
Barney : And then I'll do the same with my phone.
Marshall : So Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.
Barney : Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.
Zoey : - This is my cousin... - Honey.
Marshall : - Robin's version was... - That is exactly how it happened.
Barney : So Ted did his best to impress her,
UNK: but as per us', he bored the pants very much on her.
Ted : Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect.
Ted : Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits.
Honey : An architect.
Honey : How fascinating.
Ted : Rambling architecture anecdote.
Ted : Something about a bridge.
Barney : Straw.
Barney : Coaster.
Honey : Okay, time to go home.
Barney : Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.
Barney : Who's your daddy?
Marshall : Okay, can we skip this part, please?
Barney : Sure, I'll just summarize it.
Marshall : - That's been going on a while. - Only way I know how.
Barney : Any-who, next day, I'm going into work.
UNK: I run into Zoey.
Barney : That cousin of yours, Honey...
Barney : I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.
Zoey : Thanks.
Barney : We had a great time last night.
Barney : And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...
Zoey : - Wait, she didn't go home with Ted? - Nope, he let me have her.
Barney : I have to say, it was pretty noble of him.
Barney : He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine.
Barney : I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize...
Barney : She hugged me.
Barney : What was that all about?
Marcus : Zoey's in love with Ted.
Marcus : Wait, hear me out.
UNK: Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married,
UNK: so she tried to push him away
UNK: by setting him up with her cousin instead.
UNK: But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear,
UNK: so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn.
UNK: But then, the next morning,
UNK: upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar,
UNK: her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.
Marcus : Zoey's in love with Ted.
Marcus : I stopped by that new doughnut shop, Hertz Donuts.
Marcus : - Would you like a Hertz Donut? - Sure.
Marshall : Where's the...?
Marcus : Hurts, don't it?
Marcus : I can't believe you fell for that.
