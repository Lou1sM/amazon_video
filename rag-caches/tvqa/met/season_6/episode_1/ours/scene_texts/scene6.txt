Ted : Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby.
Ted : And not the beer.
Cindy : - I should get back. - Totally.
Cindy : Come say good-bye before you leave.
Robin : - Say good-bye before you leave? - Her words exactly.
Barney : Dude, you are so in.
Barney : That is so awesome.
UNK: A high five doesn't cut. High six!
UNK: She didn't see this.
UNK: - Good. That was lame. - Let's never do that again.
Marshall : What? Lily what?
Marshall : Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?
Lily : - Here's the thing. - Sorry. Hold on.
Ted : Just...
Marshall : It's my dad.
Marshall : Lily, it's my dad, okay?
Marshall : I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone!
Marvin : I know it's late, but I just had to call.
Ted : - How'd it go? - This is...
Marvin : Did you do everything the books say? Put the pillow under her back?
Marshall : - I'm in the middle of something. - Did it feel like a boy?
UNK: Huh? You can tell.
Marshall : He's insane.
Marshall : My dad is insane.
Marshall : I'm so sorry.
Marshall : He's just...
Marshall : He's so...
Marshall : enthusiastic.
Marshall : It's ridiculous, you know?
Marshall : Who's like that?
Ted : You.
Lily : You're like that.
Lily : You and your dad both care so much.
Lily : It's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with.
Lily : But right now, it's a lot of pressure.
Marshall : - I'm not trying to pressure you... - What if I can't have a baby?
Lily : That could happen.
Lily : I could totally let you down.
Lily : Has that thought not occurred to you?
Marshall : Not even for one second.
Marshall : Not having a baby would suck,
Marshall : but the idea of you letting me down,
Marshall : that's impossible.
Marshall : That would be like aliens landing.
Marshall : That's a bad example, because that could happen.
Marshall : It probably already has. I saw this episode...
Ted : All right.
Ted : I'm doing this.
Ted : I am going over there.
Ted : Wish me luck.
UNK: Nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet,
UNK: terrifying exhilaration of making your move.
UNK: When you just put it all on the line and go for it.
UNK: And that night, by golly,
UNK: Cindy went for it.
UNK: So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother.
UNK: She ended up being someone else's mother.
UNK: In fact, they both did.
Robin : Like I said, she's here on a date.
UNK: So that was not the day I met your mother.
UNK: The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding.
Ted : Maybe I'm a little nervous.
Marshall : - Dude, it's just a wedding toast. - I know. I want it to be great.
Ted : - I want this whole day to be great. - It will be.
Lily : Best man? You're being summoned.
Ted : Geez, what now?
Marshall : Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's...
Marshall : - Okay, and it's raining. - Yeah. You were saying?
Marshall : You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?
Ted : I didn't bring an umbrella.
Marshall : Everyone told us that it might take a while, but...
Marshall : we thought we might be the exception to the rule.
Marshall : Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean,
Marshall : feeling good about the future.
Marshall : Obviously, this goes without saying but, you won't tell Lily about any of this?
