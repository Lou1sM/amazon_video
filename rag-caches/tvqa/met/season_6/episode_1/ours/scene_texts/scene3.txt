UNK: Ted's wife : Tell me this isn't true.
Ted : I had implied dibs.
UNK: Ted's wife : You've humiliated me!
UNK: Ted's wife : I had no idea. You have to know that.
Barney : You're the victim here. We both are.
Barney : Let's get out.
UNK: Or, we could just do it right here.
Ted : Fine. Have at it.
Ted : Exercise your dibs.
Ted : She's got her shields up. She's reading a book.
Barney : At a bar. That book might as well be called :
Barney : Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny.
Barney : That is not what "shields up" looks like.
Barney : That is what "shields up" looks like.
Robin : Move.
Robin : 'Sup, dudes?
Robin : Fries?
Barney : Good God, woman. You're a disgrace.
Robin : No fries for this guy.
Barney : Seriously, I love you, but it's like
Barney : you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.
Ted : Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.
Barney : With hygiene?
UNK: No, with Don.
UNK: A few months earlier...
Ted : - Here, have some tea. - Thanks.
Ted : Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need.
Robin : Okay, about that.
Robin : Ted, listen.
Robin : I know myself pretty well.
Robin : Some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you.
Robin : And when that happens, you have to try to say no.
Ted : Try?
Ted : I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.
UNK: Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
UNK: I will come at you with everything I've got.
UNK: I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle,
UNK: careful, patient,
UNK: deadly.
UNK: And if you let your guard down for so much as a second,
UNK: as sure as you were born,
UNK: I will hump your brains out.
UNK: I'm ready to have sex now.
Ted : It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper.
Ted : She's...
Ted : Is this a Cheeto?
Robin : No, we ran out of Cheetos last week.
Robin : Yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.
Barney : You're exquisite.
Barney : You must let me paint you.
Ted : What do you think? The girl sitting at the bar, shields up?
Robin : Totes, toots. She's here on a date.
Robin : She brought the book because she got here early,
Robin : and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting.
Robin : Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know?
Ted : This? What you're doing right now?
Barney : I'm getting a "de-rection."
Ted : How'd it go? You pregnant yet?
Marshall : Nope!
Lily : So, here's what happened.
Lily : I was at home, waiting for Marshall.
Marshall : How was your day?
Marshall : Don't answer. No time.
UNK: Bedroom. No time.
UNK: Floor. No time.
Marshall : - Against this wall! - Marshall. Wait.
Lily : A big package just arrived.
Marshall : - Yeah, it did. - No.
Lily : It's a real package from your dad.
Marshall : That's a little weird, but yeah, it is.
Ted : Look!
Marshall : A bassinet? Oh, my...
Marshall : He must've made it in his wood shop.
Marshall : Wasn't that sweet of him?
Marshall : Isn't that sweet?
Lily : You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?
Marshall : Of course I did. I tell my dad everything.
Marshall : My dad is my best friend.
Marshall : We have been looking forward
Marshall : to this magical, special night for two weeks now.
Marshall : And, sweetie, during that time, I have been...
Marshall : How do I put this delicately?
Marshall : Saving all my love for you.
Lily : I have read 11 books on conception.
Lily : I have cut out
Lily : alcohol, caffeine and sugar.
Lily : I take my temperature every hour.
Lily : But good for you for not playing with yourself.
Ted : - I feel you, buddy. - Don't even touch me, dude.
Marshall : It's been two weeks.
Marshall : I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem.
Barney : Seriously.
Marshall : Okay, I'm better now.
