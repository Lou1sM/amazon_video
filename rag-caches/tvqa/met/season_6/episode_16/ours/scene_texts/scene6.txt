UNK: playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...
UNK: - You have Super Mario Kart?! - Hell, yeah.
Lily : But your mom doesn't need you.
Lily : Your life in New York needs you.
Lily : It needs you really bad.
Marshall : Baby, don't go.
Lily : Please come home soon.
Barney : - So, you were an Olympic gymnast? - Silver medal.
Barney : Sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.
Woman : That's what my dad said.
Barney : And she sticks the landing.
Barney : Why don't you start stretching, and I'll...
Marshall : be right back.
UNK: Sorry. Quick question.
UNK: Why aren't you wearing purple?
Nora : I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest.
Nora : - Can you keep a secret? - Sure.
Nora : I love Valentine's Day.
Barney : My gosh! Me, too!
Barney : Is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?
Nora : - You're a gooey romantic, too? - Guilty.
Barney : This is embarrassing,
Barney : but every year,
Barney : I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone.
Barney : Just in case, you know?
Nora : - We are pitiful. - The worst.
Nora : Although there is one difference between you and me.
Barney : What's that?
Nora : I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.
Marshall : I miss my dad, Ted.
Marshall : I miss him so much.
Ted : I know.
Marshall : When I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula.
Marshall : And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till the middle of the night.
Marshall : So, it would be pitch black,
UNK: in the middle of the woods.
UNK: And I could never see anything in front of the headlights,
UNK: but I always felt so safe
UNK: 'cause my dad was driving.
UNK: He was like some sort of superhero
UNK: who could just see way out into the darkness.
Marshall : Now he's just gone.
Marshall : And it's pitch black.
Marshall : I can't see where I'm going.
Marshall : I can't see anything.
Barney : All right.
Barney : I was playing you before.
Barney : But I was really doing you a public service.
UNK: It's February 13th.
Barney : A day many are now calling Desperation Day.
Barney : It's kind of a thing. And you,
Barney : walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic?
Barney : It comes across a bit desperate.
Nora : What's desperate about knowing what you want?
Nora : Life is really short, Barney.
Nora : Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone,
Nora : distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you
Nora : with some sad little activity?
Barney : Or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament
Barney : in Poughkeepsie.
Nora : I have no idea what any of those words mean.
Woman : I'm all stretched out!
Barney : Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.
Marshall : Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.
Marshall : Are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?
Ted : Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.
Marshall : - What? - Things with Zoey
Ted : are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything
