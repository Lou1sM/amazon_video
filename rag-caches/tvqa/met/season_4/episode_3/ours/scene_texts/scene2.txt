UNK: we all headed across the river
UNK: to experience some of that crazy New Jersey nightlife.
UNK: Okay, Stella couldn't find a sitter, so we can't go out.
UNK: Instead, we're all gonna hang out here, and it's gonna be just as awesome.
UNK: Right? We got board games, we got movies,
UNK: and I think there may be some beer out in the garage.
UNK: Ted, this is pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should be out at a bar drinking alcohol.
UNK: Now I know that that sounds depressing, bordering on tragic, but it's just a fact!
UNK: Yeah, and I wanna take another crack at that chick, Doris.
UNK: - I know I can land that lesbian plane. - No snakes on that plane.
UNK: Okay, guys. Come on, you promised. Let's just hang out here, try to have fun.
