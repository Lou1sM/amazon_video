UNK: Now, you kids can either believe this or not,
UNK: but this is how your Aunt Robin swears it happened.
Lily : Look, Stella, I understand that, coming from New Jersey,
UNK: you don't picture yourself loving New York,
UNK: but trust me, Marshall didn't expect to,
UNK: and now he wouldn't think of living anywhere else.
Marshall : I hate New York!
UNK: I'm sorry, but it's true.
UNK: Okay, today I was walking around PriceCo. Have you ever been there? It's huge.
UNK: All the stores in New York are so cramped. Every time I turn, I knock something over.
UNK: I'm like some huge monster that came out of the ocean to destroy bodegas.
Lily : - But, Marshall, you love New York. - Yeah, I do, except that I hate it.
UNK: I'm too big for New York, okay?
UNK: I'm always trying to fit into cramped little subway seats
UNK: or duck under doorways that were built 150 years ago.
UNK: Hey, guess what? People are bigger now. Build bigger doorways.
UNK: - What the hell is the matter with you? - Small city, big man, give it up.
UNK: And it's so loud all the time. Yes, it's the city that never sleeps.
UNK: Well, guess what, I like to sleep. I've been tired for eight years.
Marshall : Tired and scared with black and blue marks on my elbows
UNK: from trying to fit through all these tiny elf doorways.
Marshall : New Jersey's great.
UNK: It's got huge stores and lawns and you never have to carry a cup again.
UNK: Not for the rest of your life. I'm not afraid to say it. I love New Jersey.
UNK: I'm just kidding.
UNK: Look, Stella, I get it, okay?
UNK: I see what you're saying. I guess,
Ted : we could live in Brooklyn.
UNK: You know what, Ted? Live wherever you want. I don't care.
UNK: Awkward silence. Tap it.
Ted : Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?
UNK: There were some loud noises in the basement.
UNK: Sorry about that.
UNK: - Why don't you get back to bed, sweetie? - I can't go to sleep without a story.
UNK: - Okay, I'll just get your mom... - Why don't you read it to me?
UNK: Okay, come on.
UNK: You know she thrills me with all her charms
UNK: When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
UNK: My little girl gives me everything
UNK: When I'm walking down the street with you
UNK: Sing sha la la la la la la
UNK: I'm moving here.
Stella : - Really? - Really.
Ted : New Jersey wins.
Robin : Thank you!
UNK: Wait!
Robin : Good evening, New York.
UNK: Hey, look, she made it.
UNK: Our top story tonight,
UNK: the newborn panda at the Central Park Zoo got its first tooth today.
UNK: I guess that makes her a molar bear.
Robin : Molar bear.
Robin : Molar bear.
UNK: You know what? I really am done. Good night, New York.
UNK: Wow, she really quit.
UNK: You think we had anything to do with that?
UNK: Yeah, I think we did.
UNK: Nice job, Barney.
Barney : Oh, my God! Thank you!
UNK: That was killing my arm.
UNK: My arm hasn't been this sore since I was 13 years old
UNK: and figured out how to lock a bathroom. Up top.
Ted : Oh, no.
Lucy : - Hey. - Hey.
Lucy : - Hey. - What's wrong?
UNK: Well, I officially didn't get that job.
UNK: - I'm so sorry. - That's okay.
UNK: They offered me another one.
UNK: Hey, that's great. What are you gonna be doing?
Robin : Foreign correspondent. I'm moving to Japan.
