UNK: Kids, when I first moved to New York,
UNK: it was dingy, disgusting, dirty, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky,
UNK: and altogether terrifying.
UNK: But then, sadly, the whole city started to go uphill.
UNK: The streets got a little cleaner,
UNK: the rents got a little higher, and one by one,
UNK: the crappy old places we loved began to disappear.
UNK: The Elbow Room, an old punk-rock club, became a drugstore.
UNK: McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place.
UNK: And Fez, this awesome lounge at 85th and Broadway, became a bank.
UNK: And not just any bank.
