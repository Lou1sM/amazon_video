UNK: Hey, babe.
UNK: I've been thinking about our fight.
UNK: Yes?
UNK: I'm really, really...
UNK: Surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet.
UNK: Wow, you really want to open this up again.
UNK: Oh, I forgot, you open everything up,
UNK: Even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead.
UNK: You know that this is important to me.
UNK: Why won't you just write the letter?
UNK: Because I can't bear the thought of not being with you,
UNK: Not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter.
Ted : Really?
UNK: Yes, really.
UNK: Plus, I know as soon as I write it,
UNK: You're just going to open it up and read it again.
UNK: Lily, I won't, I promise.
Marshall : Okay.
UNK: I'll write you a letter for my death folder.
UNK: Do you mind, um, maybe slipping
UNK: In a little bit of dirty stuff, too?
UNK: I tell you what.
UNK: How about I make it all dirty stuff
UNK: And slip in a little clean stuff?
UNK: You're the best.
UNK: And maybe a couple polaroids?
UNK: Come on, let's get out of here.
UNK: This night's a disaster. What?!
UNK: This night couldn't have gone any better.
UNK: We just survived a mugging.
UNK: You know what that means.
UNK: "Thank god we're alive" sex.
UNK: "Thank god we're alive" sex.
UNK: It's even better
UNK: Than "I can't believe you just proposed to me" sex,
UNK: Which I've only had, like, four or five times.
UNK: Ted, please, we are so close.
UNK: All right, I'm in.
UNK: I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.
UNK: Whew!
UNK: Wow, I think we all need
UNK: To go back to our place and recover.
Lily : Yeah.
UNK: I just want to celebrate
UNK: The fact that we survived.
Robin : You know?
UNK: Mm-hmm.
UNK: Me, too.
UNK: So where do you live?
UNK: What, west village? Close.
UNK: West orange.
UNK: West orange, new jersey? Yeah.
UNK: You guys live in new jersey, not new york?
UNK: Theodore. Yep.
UNK: New jersey? Teddy. Yeah, but don't worry,
UNK: It's pretty much new york. Ted : Oh.
Ted : No.
UNK: Oh, no.
UNK: Oh, no. New jersey is not "pretty much new york."
Barney : You are not "pretty much new yorkers."
UNK: And how would you know? Because I live here.
UNK: That's right, I live here.
UNK: Yes, we're full of crap.
UNK: Yes, we pretended to be from out of town
UNK: So we could sleep with you and leave in the morning.
UNK: But you know what's even worse than that?
UNK: Saying you're a new yorker when you're not.
UNK: Because this is the greatest city in the world
UNK: And you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker.
UNK: So why don't you girls crawl
UNK: Into the open sewer pipe you call the holland tunnel
UNK: And flush yourselves back to "pretty much new york"?
UNK: Because I will do a lot
UNK: To get laid,
UNK: But I am not going to new jersey!
UNK: You're not from missouri?
UNK: Well, I will be a monkey's unc...
UNK: Ew. Right.
