Stella : Still no.
Stella : Still no.
Ted : What's up with that?
Ted : I mean, I juggled.
Barney : You juggled?
Barney : I thought you were trying to impress her.
Ted : You do magic.

Lily : No, no, you are on a time-out.
Lily : Go sit over there.
UNK: But... Go!
Ted : Anyway... I don't get it.
Ted : She should be into me by now.
Lily : You know, you can do this, ted.

Ted : Ther-there's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.
Barney : You can't turn a "no" into a "yes," ted.
Barney : Can't be done.
Robin : I don't know, barney.
Robin : I mean, sometimes persistence pays off.
Robin : I said "yes" eventually.
Barney : No, you didn't.
Barney : You were like, "no, we can't, we're friends."
Barney : It would mess up the dynamic of the group."
Robin : To ted.
Barney : Oh, right.
Ted : Wait a second.
Ted : Wait a second, I got the angle.

Stella : That some of the patients would be nicer to you.
Ted : The receptionist.
Ted : That's my way in.
Barney : I like this.
Barney : Seduce the receptionist.
Barney : That's a great plan.
