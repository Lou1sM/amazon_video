UNK: Woman 1, to Ted : Is something wrong?
Ted : No, it's just, um...
Ted : I'm just a little embarrassed.
Ted : I thought this was a date.
Ted : But it's no big deal.
Ted : Don't worry about it.
UNK: Woman 2, to Woman 1 : What's wrong?
UNK: Woman 1, to Woman 2 : Ted's embarrassed... he thought this was a date.

UNK: Woman 3, to Stella : Stella, did you know ted thought this was a date?
UNK: Stella, to Woman 3 : What? I'm not allowed to date a patient.
UNK: Stella, to Woman 3 : It's an ama rule.
UNK: Woman 3, to Woman 2 : She's not allowed to date patients.
UNK: Stella, to Woman 3 : It's an ama rule.
UNK: Woman 3, to Woman 2 : She's not allowed to date patients.
UNK: Stella, to Woman 3 : It's an ama rule.
UNK: Woman 3, to Woman 2 : She's not allowed to date...
Ted : Yeah, I got it.
Man : We all got it.
Man : Ted's a schmuck.
Stella : And you bought all the tickets. Yeah, yeah.
Ted : Hey, you were right.
Ted : Worst movie-going experience ever.
Ted : Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie.
Stella : I am so sorry that you thought that was a date.
Ted : No, it's fine.
Ted : I got to hang out with you on girls' night out.
Ted : All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient,
Ted : I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up
Ted : And then I'll ask you out then.
UNK: Well, then, fair warning :
UNK: I'm going to say no.
Ted : Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you.
Ted : I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time.
UNK: What, you're married? No.
UNK: Boyfriend? No.
UNK: Lesbian? No.
UNK: Only date black guys? No.
Ted : And yet you can say with absolute confidence
Ted : That ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date,
Ted : Your answer will be...
UNK: Ted from 2030 : No.
Robin : No... Hmm.
Robin : What could she mean
UNK: When she says no?
Robin : I don't know,
Robin : It is totally cryptic.
Ted : This is far from over.
Ted : We're talking ten weeks from now.
Ted : Who knows what she'll want then?
UNK: I mean, do you know what you're going to want
Ted : For lunch ten weeks from now?
Marshall : Sloppy joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.
Barney : Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman
Barney : To decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy?
Barney : 8.3 seconds.
Barney : After that,
Barney : Her decision is made.
Barney : She will not change her mind.
Ted : That's ridiculous.
Barney : Is it?
Barney : Describe your first 8.3 seconds with stella.
Stella : Lower back butterfly tattoo...
Stella : You're up.
Ted : So we got off to a rocky start.
Ted : That may be a problem for some guys,
Ted : But I get better over time. Right?
Ted : I'm not some top 40 song...
Ted : Easily digestible.
Ted : I'm complex.
Ted : I require time and multiple listens.
UNK: I'm "stairway to heaven."
Robin : Wow, roger daltrey just rolled over in his grave.
Robin : That's not the right guy, is it?
Robin : He's not even dead, is he?
Lily : I think that's great, ted.
Lily : You can do whatever you set your mind to.
Lily : In fact, you've inspired me.
Lily : I'm going to stop biting my nails.
Marshall : But, baby, you love biting your nails.
Lily : I know, but I'm doing this for ted.
Robin : Hmm.
Lily : God, this is really hard.
Ted : Give me ten sessions,
Ted : I'm going to turn that "no" into a "yes."
UNK: Really, ted? Mm-hmm.
UNK: You think so? Mm.
Barney : Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?
Stella : This is going to hurt a little.
Ted : Yeah, well, I can handle pain.
Ted : This one time I was playing tennis, and...
Stella : Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts.
Stella : Everyone probably sounds like that.
Abby : Doctor, are you all right?
Abby : I heard a woman screaming in here.
Stella : Oh.
Ted : Here's to nine more great sessions.
