Barney : From days of our lives, I'd be the king?
Ted : Well...
Marshall : Why wasn't I told about the belt?
Marshall : I could go for the belt.
Marshall : If lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.
UNK: If I died, I would just come back and haunt your penis.
UNK: Guys, come on! Help me out. What do I do?

Marshall : Two sexy nurses, with a six-pack of wine coolers,
Marshall : Sneak into my room late at night.
Marshall : I try to blink at them in morse code.
Marshall : "Please, don't. I love my dead wife."
Marshall : But they're medical professionals,

Lily : Fine. Sleep with your nurses.
Lily : Tonight you ride the unicycle.
Marshall : I already did this morning.
Ted : Hello.
