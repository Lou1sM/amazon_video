UNK: Ka-zowie! Aah!
Barney : You've been vanquished, old bean.
Barney : That's 'cause you distracted me.
Barney : You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.
UNK: Ah... Stinson.
Ted : I've got a situation.
Ted : Trudy is here... you know, from the pineapple incident?
UNK: Oh, you mean the girl that chalked your pool cue
UNK: And snuck down the fire escape?
UNK: Respect.
Ted : So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up
UNK: And they're kind of competitive.
UNK: I think the new girl's kind of into me.
Barney : So you now have two on the line?
Ted : And I don't know which one to go for.
UNK: Go for the new girl!
Barney : Given the choice, always party with dr. Strangelove.
Lily : New girl? What new girl?
Barney : Two girls are allegedly vying
Barney : For ted's affections, and I think...
Lily : Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
Lily : Give it to me.
Lily : Are they friends?
UNK: Yeah. Uh, no... I-I don't know.
Ted : They're old sorority sisters.
Lily : Are they betas?
Lily : Because they're all sluts,
Lily : And you can tell them right now
UNK: I didn't want to be in their sorority anyway.
Ted : They're kappas, and...
Ted : I think I can score with one of them.
Ted : I don't know which one,
UNK: And if I chose wrong, I lose them both.
UNK: Okay, well, don't worry.
UNK: I'll-I'll come down and help you figure it out.
Marshall : I thought we were in for the evening?
Barney : That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there,
Barney : But I guess we're both wrong, guv'na.
UNK: Hey. Oh, ted. Okay...
UNK: Settle an argument. Mm-hmm.
Trudy : Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend
Trudy : After they've broken up?
Ted : Well, that's very complicated...
UNK: See?! He agrees with me.
Rachel : You're such a little man-thief.
Trudy : You're the man-thief, man-thief.
Ted : Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.
Trudy : You're so funny.
Trudy : I think ted is funny.
Ted : Really? I think ted is hilarious.
Ted : I am never not wearing a suit again.
UNK: Hello?
Lily : It's me. I'm at the bar.
UNK: Don't look. Just call me "mom."
UNK: Uh, hey, mom. How's dad's... Colon?
Ted : What? What's the matter with you?
Lily : Anyway, both of these girls are into you; take your pick.
Ted : They are? Are you sure? Yes, of course.
Lily : They're playing with their hair and touching your arm.
UNK: Classic green light.
Ted : Are you positive?
UNK: Oh, that is so fascinating.
Robin : So what happened?
UNK: Well, after 18 hours of surgery,
UNK: Robin's date : I closed, and, thankfully,
UNK: Robin's date : Both girls just celebrated their second birthday.
Robin : Wow. Gosh, separating conjoined twins,
Robin : That must be the most amazing feeling.
UNK: Robin's date : True, but now the parents don't know what to do
UNK: Robin's date : With their huge supply of four-legged overalls.
Robin : That is so funny.
Trudy : You're so funny.
Lily : Positive. They both want you bad.
Lily : It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.
Lily : Oh, it's robin. Good luck.
Ted : Bye, mom.
UNK: That's my mom.
UNK: Hello?
Robin : Bring me a razor.
Lily : What about the no-shave rule?
Robin : What happened to your convictions?
Robin : They've been surgically removed by dr. Awesome.
Lily : No, I'm not doing it.
Lily : The whole point to not shaving was to...
UNK: Lily, please! He's really cute,
Robin : And I really like him, and he's got a british accent.
Lily : I'm on my way.
Ted : So this college boyfriend, who won him?
Trudy : Neither of us.
Rachel : He left. Junior year abroad.
UNK: It's really too bad, 'cause...
Trudy : There was that one thing we wanted to do.
UNK: We were going to do...
UNK: But we never did.
UNK: Why? Wait, what were you guys going to do but never did?
Rachel : No, it's too embarrassing.
UNK: You tell him. No, you tell him.
UNK: No, I don't care if you don't care.
UNK: Nobody cares! Just say it.
Rachel : Why don't we tell him together.
UNK: Okay.
Trudy : On three.
Lily : One...
UNK: Well, he's right : It's a dead heat.
Barney : Two...
Lily : Neither one is giving ground.
Lily : I could not tell who was the third wheel.
Ted : Three.
Ted : It's a tricycle.
