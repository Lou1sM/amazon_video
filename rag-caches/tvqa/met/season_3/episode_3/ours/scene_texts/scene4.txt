Ted : I'll go get it in my bedroom.
Ted : The cd's in my bedroom.
Ted : Bedroom...
UNK: Okay. We'll try and stay out of trouble.
Lily : Of course, we can't promise anything.
UNK: This is going to be awesome.
Rachel : No!
UNK: : What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got, I've got...
Lily : We know, ted, well done.
Lily : This is very impressive.
UNK: Up top. Yeah, bro, up top.
Lily : Oh, don't be gross.
Ted : You guys need to get out of here.
Ted : Please, take the fire escape.
Marshall : No, no way.
Marshall : The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it
Marshall : And the whole thing shifted.
Lily : Oh, you can use our bedroom.
UNK: Okay, all I need to seal the deal
UNK: Is the wilco cd, barney.
UNK: What are you doing?!
Barney : I cannot allow ted to do this.
UNK: Wh-what? Why?
Barney : Because the belt is my birthright!
UNK: You cannot claim it before I do.
Barney : That would be like jimmy olsen capturing lex luthor
Barney : While superman watches impotently from the bedroom.
Marshall : But, barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than ted.
Marshall : You're disgusting.
Barney : I've never ridden the tricycle.
Barney : I was on the verge last year.
UNK: I was so close.
Barney : So ladies, why don't we move this party
Barney : To a more horizontal location?
UNK: Oh, my god, my new carpet!
UNK: Blonde Girl : Oh, my god, this is a disaster.
UNK: Blonde Girl : You get the carpet cleaner. I'll get a towel.
UNK: Okay. I'll get the video camera.
UNK: Get out! Okay then.
UNK: So let me get this straight.
UNK: You're going to trike-block me?
Ted : That is so petty. It's like you're...
UNK: Tom petty. Tom petty.
Ted : You're tom petty.
Ted : Where's lily?
Ted : Still looking for that cd,
UNK: Future Ted : So...
Ted : What are you doing?
Lily : I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl
Lily : And I was right.
UNK: I saw 'em first!
Lily : You just made the list, bitch.
Lily : I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief.
Lily : She should be punished, not rewarded.
Ted : Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me!
Lily : No, never.
Ted : What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?
UNK: Please enjoy our bedroom. Great.
UNK: Just take it.
UNK: Okay, wish me luck.
UNK: Oh, my god. It looks fine.
UNK: You're such a girl.
Robin : Where's the shaving cream?
Waitress : Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.
Robin : Well, it was implied.
Robin : Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?
Waitress : Well, who doesn't shave their legs for a date?
Robin : Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?
Waitress : Well, here's a little tip for you :
Waitress : Shave your legs before you leave the house, sasquatch.
UNK: Hey, robin, um, the valet's brought the car around.
UNK: I thought we'd go to my place,
UNK: If you're in the mood for a nightcap.
Robin : Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies' room.
Robin : I've got tb.
Robin : Tiny bladder.
Robin : I'll meet you out front.
Marshall : Yeah.
UNK: You've got to be kidding me.
UNK: Excuse me. Sorry.
Ted : So, I'm having a little trouble finding the cd.
UNK: That's okay.
Rachel : We don't need music to have fun.
Ted : Exactly.
Trudy : You do like to have fun, don't you, ted?
Ted : It's getting late. I'll get your coats.
