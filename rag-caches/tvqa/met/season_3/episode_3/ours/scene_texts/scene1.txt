Ted : Kids, I know you think that you've heard every story
UNK: Future Ted : From back before I met your mother,
UNK: Future Ted : But there are some stories you tell
UNK: Future Ted : And some stories you don't.
UNK: Oh, my god!...
Ted : oh, my god...
Barney : Use your words, ted.
UNK: Okay. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.
Barney : The belt?
Ted : The belt.
Barney : But that's impossible.
Barney : You were up here less than half an hour ago.
UNK: Yes! Advantage... erikson.
Barney : Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.
UNK: "Fortnight."
Marshall : British words are so cool.
Marshall : Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs?
Marshall : I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.
Ted : All right.
Ted : I'm ready. Let's hit it.
UNK: We can't go. Tournament.
Ted : What? We agreed. I suited up...
Barney : You take too long to get ready.
Ted : What are you talking about?
UNK: I got the low maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.
Marshall : Yeah, which takes an hour and a half
Marshall : Of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.
Barney : And then he starts on his hair.
Rachel : Ace!
Ted : Look, are we going or not?
Barney : Just go without us. We'll be there in five minutes.
Ted : Really?
UNK: Yes! Yes!
UNK: All right, I'm going down to the bar.
