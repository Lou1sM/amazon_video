UNK: I'm ordering three beers.
UNK: I'll see you guys in five minutes.
UNK: Three beers, five minutes.
UNK: Wii announcer : Love-30!
Robin : Thanks for lending me these boots.
UNK: Where'd you get them from?
Lily : This store in the village had one of those crazy sales.
Lily : It was a footwear feeding frenzy.
UNK: I saw 'em first!
UNK: You just made the list, bitch!
Barney : So many questions.
Barney : Firstly, what do you think would happen
Barney : If a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?
Lily : You look fantastic in them, robin.
Lily : But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?
UNK: Well, that's the point : It's to hide that fact
Robin : That I haven't shaved my legs.
Robin : I've begun a strict no-shave policy
Robin : For the first three dates.
Robin : It's all about self-control.
Robin : If I don't shave, I must behave.
Fyi : It doesn't matter, baby.
UNK: Guys just want to get on the green.
Barney : They don't mind going through the rough.
UNK: Shh-clackey!
Barney : Stinson.
Ted : All right, the beers are here.
Barney : Yeah, we're not going to make it.
UNK: Oh, come on! We agreed...
Ted : Did marshall take his pants off?
Barney : Yeah, pants are off.
Marshall : This is wimbledon, ted.
Marshall : I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide.
UNK: Cheerio!
Ted : Fine.
Ted : I don't need friends.
Ted : I got you guys.
Ted : You guys are my friends,
Ted : My cold refreshing friends.
Ted : I'm talking to beer.
UNK: Ted? Trudy.
Trudy : Trudy.
Ted : Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since...
Trudy : I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape.
Ted : That was you?
UNK: I'm kidding. I was super-wasted.
Ted : These are not all for me.
UNK: No, I was going to call you, but I was so embarrassed.
Trudy : You were embarrassed?
Trudy : I was like, "I really like this guy,
UNK: "and now I'm climbing out his window,
UNK: And I forgot my underwear..."
Ted : Those were yours?
UNK: God, I thought they felt kind of tight.
Ted : I'm kidding. I don't wear underwear.
UNK: Ladies' underwear.
Ted : Often.
UNK: Ah! Again, I'm kidding.
UNK: I'm so glad I ran into you.
UNK: I know. Do you want to...? Trudy?!
Rachel : No way!
UNK: Oh, my god! Rachel, how are you?
Trudy : Ted, this is rachel.
UNK: Hi!
UNK: Rachel, Trudy : Kappa epsilon gamma! Kappa epsilon gamma!
UNK: Whoo! Whoo!
UNK: Wait, let me guess. You guys met in prison.
UNK: No! We were sorority sisters.
Trudy : And best friends forever all sophomore year.
Rachel : When we weren't at each other's throats.
Trudy : We could be so competitive.
UNK: Uh, but that's all behind us now.
UNK: Hey, mista! Hey, mista!
UNK: Stay away from my sista! Stay away from my sista!
UNK: Whoo! Whoo!
Trudy : We have so much catching up to do.
UNK: Okay. Are you going to stacey's wedding?
Trudy : Oh, it's off. Apparently, he's into dudes.
UNK: Nah! Again?! That's like her third one.
Trudy : I know!
Ted : Well, beers, what do you want to do?
UNK: We could stay here...
Ted : Or I know this other place called "my belly."
Rachel : So, trudy and I got a table.
UNK: Oh, that's cool. I was going to get out of here anyway.
Ted : I'm really tired.
Rachel : I want you to stay.
Ted : Tired of people who fold early, 'cause I am wide awake!
UNK: Okay, guys... Be cool.
