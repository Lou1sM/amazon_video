Marshall : That is a shocking revelation
Marshall : That we're just finding out about right now.
Ted : Stella, I'm sorry.
Ted : I shouldn't have told them.
Ted : But they're my best friends. I tell them everything.
Ted : I-I didn't even think about it.
Stella : Ted, that was so personal.
Stella : Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.
Ted : No, they don't.
Stella : Look, I realize it's weird, okay?
Stella : Not many people go five years without having sex.
UNK: 13 years?!
Randy : I peaked really young.
Stella : That's why it was difficult for me to tell you.
Stella : But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.
UNK: You c trust me.
Stella : Obviously, I can't.
Stella : You know, there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy,
Stella : And you just gave me yours.
UNK: Wait, did I give you a reason,
Ted : Or were you looking for one?
UNK: Why would I be looking for one?
UNK: Because things are getting serious between us,
UNK: And that scares you.
