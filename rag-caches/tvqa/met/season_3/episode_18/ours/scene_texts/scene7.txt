UNK: We wrap his face in gauze so he can't bleed or talk.
UNK: You are the woman...
UNK: Barney, why are you so desperate to have this happen?
UNK: I'm a wingman.
UNK: That's what wingmen do.
UNK: Is it possible
UNK: That you're trying to fill the void of losing ted
UNK: By rushing into a new wingman relationship?
UNK: What are you saying?
UNK: I'm saying that randy is your rebound bro.
Narrator : No.
UNK: That's crazy.
UNK: What randy and I have is real.
UNK: No, it's not, barney.
UNK: And even if you got randy laid tonight,
UNK: Would it feel anywhere near as meaningful
UNK: As when you got ted laid?
UNK: He was just so happy the next morning, you know?
Ted : I know.
UNK: All right.
UNK: It hasn't clotted,
UNK: But I think it's pretty much draining backwards now.
Barney : Randy...
UNK: I've been thinking,
UNK: This isn't working out.
UNK: Yeah, I figured.
UNK: I knew I couldn't fly this close to the sun
UNK: Without getting burned.
UNK: This is the story of my life.
UNK: I always let people down.
UNK: You, my dad, the chief.
UNK: The chief?
UNK: Yeah, I was a cop for, like, three months.
UNK: But I got kicked off the force
UNK: Because I screwed up so much, I was an insurance liability.
UNK: You were a new york city police officer,
UNK: And you didn't tell me?
UNK: Wow!
UNK: Did you ever shoot anybody?
UNK: Only all the time.
UNK: But not himself.
UNK: And not in the foot.
UNK: Actually... Ah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
UNK: But nothing.
UNK: I don't think there's anything hotter than a cop.
UNK: Are you okay?
UNK: Your nose is bleeding.
UNK: Uh, old injury.
UNK: The bullet's still lodged in his sinus.
UNK: Oh, my god!
Robin : You know what?
UNK: I live right around the corner.
UNK: Can I take you to my place
UNK: And fix you up?
UNK: That would be very nice.
Barney : Yes.
UNK: Have a great time, you two.
UNK: : Oh, my god, thank you. I can't thank you enough.
UNK: I am the greatest wingman of all time.
UNK: Ted doesn't know what he's missing.
UNK: : You had to mention ted, didn't you?
UNK: Okay, I really overreacted last night.
UNK: Barney he is at work, in the phone : I'm sorry.
UNK: Maybe I have some trust issues,
UNK: But believe me, I have earned them.
UNK: You said that I was looking for a reason
UNK: For this whole thing to fall apart.
UNK: Well, you're onto me, ted.
UNK: That's actually something that I do a lot.
UNK: But I'm not going to do that with you.
UNK: Ted... I'm in.
UNK: This is awkward.
UNK: I have a girl here.
UNK: Barney he is at work, in the phone : So...
UNK: Come on.
UNK: There is something that I'm ready to do with you.
UNK: âª ...Who's that looking in the mirror? âª
UNK: âª Gonna take your time...
UNK: Ted, this is lucy.
UNK: Hi, lucy. Lucy, this is ted.
Narrator : Stella and I thought our relationship
UNK: Was going to take a big step that weekend.
UNK: Turned out, it took an even bigger one.
UNK: She's sound asleep. Oh.
UNK: She is so great.
UNK: I think so.
UNK: So, uh, I was thinking,
UNK: My sister is in town until tomorrow.
UNK: And, uh, there's a motel just down the turnpike.
Stella : Hmm.
UNK: Wow, that was amazing! Oh, yeah.
Barney : What are you doing?
UNK: I gotta call marshall and lily. Tell them about this.
Marshall : Ow!
