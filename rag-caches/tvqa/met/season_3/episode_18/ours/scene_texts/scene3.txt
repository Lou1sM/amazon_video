Barney : How would you like to be my new wingman?
Randy : Uh...
Randy : Just need to check my calendar. Be right back.
Randy : Tomorrow works.
Ted : I have a surprise appetizer for us today.
Ted : Check it out.
Ted : Potato skins.
Stella : Fancy.
Ted : Yeah, right?
Ted : God, it's been forever since I had potato skins.
Ted : I remember them as being
Ted : Pretty much the most delicious things ever.
Ted : Huh.
Ted : That's surprising.
Robin : What?
Ted : This potato skin.
Ted : It's good, but not nearly as good
Ted : As I'd built it up to be in my head.
UNK: Even though this potato skin performed admirably,
Ted : And is a totally respectable size...
Ted : I couldn't enjoy it
Ted : Because of my own unrealistic expectations.
Stella : Hmm, ted, I see what you're doing.
UNK: Huh? You're trying to lower
Stella : My expectations for tonight.
UNK: Is this a length thing? No.
UNK: Quick on the draw? No.
UNK: Unexpected number of testicles? No!
UNK: It's just that this is a big deal for you.
UNK: I mean, it's like your virginity : The sequel.
UNK: Virginity 2 : Electric boogaloo?
Ted : Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up.
Ted : I don't want you to ever wonder if I was worth it.
Stella : Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it.
Stella : Stop worrying.
Stella : It's you and me.
Stella : It already has everything it needs.
Ted : "Unexpected number of testicles?"
Stella : It happens. I knew a guy in med school...
UNK: We used to joke that he was one ball away from getting walked.
Randy : Hey.
Randy : What up, bro-seph lieberman?
Barney : No, uh-uh.
Barney : Randy, we never use the word "bro" in the name
Barney : Of a failed democratic vice presidential candidate.
Ted : Good-bye, "geraldine ferrar-bro."
Robin : You know what?
Barney : I'm excited about this, randy.
Barney : You will be my next masterpiece.
Barney : It's like with ted.
Barney : When I first met him,
Barney : He was an even bigger loser than you.
Randy : What a loser.
Barney : But tonight, I am going to make you
Barney : The greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.
UNK: Oh, well, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro.
Randy : Yeah, I've been reading your blog for years.
Randy : You are like a god to me.
Randy : That's why tonight is going to be legendary...
Randy : Wait for it...
Randy : Dary.
Lily : Oh.
Barney : Okay, randy, let's do this.
Barney : Okay.
Barney : You ready?
Barney : Yes.
UNK: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Barney : What? What's the matter?
Randy : Nothing.
Barney : Let's do this.
Randy : No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please.
Randy : Just wait. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait!
Barney : Randy, what are you doing?
UNK: Dripping with game, that's what I'm doing.
UNK: Okay, let's go. No. Let's...
UNK: Yes. No!
UNK: Randy, listen to me : You can do this, okay?
