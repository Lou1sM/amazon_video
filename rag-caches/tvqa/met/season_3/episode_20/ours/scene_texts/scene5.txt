UNK: I know it looks like I have a tiny hat,
UNK: But in reality, I have an abnormally large head!
UNK: I was going through a stressful time.
UNK: I wasn't getting enough sleep.
UNK: Fourscore and seven years ago,
UNK: I had a great, big giant head!
UNK: I had just bought an apartment,
UNK: And there were some problems.
UNK: I-I don't want to bore you with the details.
UNK: I only regret that I have but one giant head
UNK: To give for my country.
UNK: Sir, if you could just see your way into giving me
UNK: One more chance, I promise... Marshall.
UNK: I'm willing to give this a second chance.
UNK: I remember my
UNK: First years as an attorney.
UNK: Why, I don't know how many hours I spent.
UNK: I don't think I ever left...
UNK: Oh, my god! Lice.
UNK: I have lice.
UNK: Those little bastards gave me lice.
UNK: God, it itches.
UNK: Don't scratch it.
UNK: You'll look like a fool.
UNK: You'll never get your job back.
UNK: Okay, you can scratch, but just make it subtle.
UNK: Okay, that's not working.
UNK: Oh, sweet, sharp corner of the desk,
UNK: How I long to rub my infested scalp against you.
UNK: I was, um... Just, uh...
UNK: You okay, eriksen?
UNK: Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.
UNK: I am good.
UNK: Continue.
UNK: Mind over matter.
UNK: There are no lice in my hair...
UNK: Laying eggs,
UNK: Burrowing into my scalp,
UNK: Eating their way all the way down to my brain!
UNK: I have lice!
UNK: "Lice"?! Lice! Get out!
UNK: Get out of my office!
UNK: We've got lice!
UNK: Everybody out of the building.
UNK: If it weren't for the lice,
UNK: I would have gotten my job back,
UNK: And I would have been working there when,
UNK: Two weeks later, the securities and exchange commission
UNK: Came a-knocking.
UNK: God sent those lice to my head
UNK: Like he sent the locusts to egypt :
UNK: To liberate me from corporate bondage.
UNK: Miracle.
UNK: Hey, guys.
UNK: Oh, I'm just so glad
UNK: You and ted are back together. Yeah.
UNK: Wait, um, what do you mean "back together"?
UNK: Well, you know, since you guys broke up.
UNK: What? Oh, no.
UNK: It was just a small fight.
UNK: That wasn't a breakup.
UNK: Was that a breakup? Did he think that was a breakup?
UNK: What?
UNK: Son of a bitch!
UNK: That was a breakup. Wasn't it?
UNK: You broke up with me.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I didn't know that that was a breakup.
UNK: Are you kidding?
UNK: I-I said, "I feel awful."
UNK: You said, "we're good."
UNK: Then you got up and left.
UNK: Yeah, I said, "we're good,"
UNK: As in "we're good."
UNK: Like when the waiter comes around and asks
UNK: If you want any more muffins, and you say, "we're good."
UNK: Exactly, and I took that "we're good" to mean
UNK: You didn't want any more
UNK: Metaphorical relationship muffins.
UNK: This is crazy.
UNK: Forget about all that.
UNK: That was a whole life-changing car accident ago.
UNK: I love you.
UNK: I don't want to break up.
UNK: But you did.
UNK: You did want to.
UNK: And if you had those feelings once,
UNK: Then you're going to have those feelings again,
UNK: And you're going to keep on having them.
UNK: And I can't count on that car to hit you
UNK: Every time you do.
UNK: What are you saying?
UNK: I'm saying...
UNK: You wanted your breakup,
UNK: You got it.
UNK: What?! Stella, wait!
UNK: No, you know what, ted?
UNK: We're good.
UNK: So you broke up with her and she didn't know it?
UNK: Apparently.
UNK: And you actually said, "I want to break up"?
UNK: No, of course not.
UNK: Who says "I want to break up"?
UNK: That's a horrible thing to say.
UNK: Well, that's true.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Hi, ted mosby? We have you
UNK: Listed as the emergency contact for barney stinson.
