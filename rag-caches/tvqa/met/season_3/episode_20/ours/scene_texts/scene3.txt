UNK: âª
UNK: Hey, guys.
UNK: Jell-o?
UNK: I can't believe this. So you're totally fine.
UNK: No, I'm not fine.
UNK: I made the biggest mistake of my life.
UNK: I want stella back.
UNK: I've left her like ten messages, but her phone's off.
UNK: She's at that
UNK: Arcade kiddie funland with her daughter.
UNK: Please.
UNK: Let me go to kiddie funland.
UNK: You can say that all you want, buddy,
UNK: But you're not getting any morphine.
UNK: No, I'm serious. I got to get out of here.
UNK: You're not going anywhere until we get the tests back.
UNK: You could have internal bleeding.
UNK: Your brain could be all full of blood.
UNK: Think that's good for it?
UNK: It ain't.
UNK: This sucks.
UNK: This sucks.
UNK: This sucks. This sucks. Are you...
UNK: Are you kidding me?
UNK: You walked away
UNK: From a car accident without a scratch.
UNK: A miracle took place today.
UNK: Oh, here we go.
UNK: You don't think this was a miracle?
UNK: There's no such thing as miracles.
UNK: March 2006, maclaren's bar.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: That's terrible. Gentle.
UNK: That's in! Gentle.
UNK: Ow. Here we go.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Bravo.
UNK: Cheers...
UNK: Mm-hmm.
UNK: No... Way.
UNK: That did not just happen.
UNK: Am I dead?
UNK: Am I dead?
UNK: Miracle!
UNK: A pencil went up barney's nose,
UNK: And you call it a miracle.
UNK: Well, do you have a better explanation for it?
UNK: A drunk jackass with a box of pencils?
UNK: A drunk jackass called "god!"
UNK: And a box of pencils called "destiny!"
UNK: Speaking of barney, I should give him a call.
UNK: Why? We're not friends anymore.
UNK: You'd want to know if this happened to him.
UNK: Go for barney.
UNK: Hey, barney.
UNK: Listen, I have something to tell you.
UNK: Oh, boy, here we go.
UNK: I've been waiting for this one.
UNK: You talked to robin.
UNK: She told you what's under the hood
UNK: And you want to take it for a spin yourself.
UNK: Not even if you boiled it in detergent.
UNK: It's about ted.
UNK: Ted?
UNK: My former best friend ted
UNK: Who I asked you never to mention to me again?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: He's been in a car accident.
UNK: He's at saint anthony's hospital.
UNK: Everything's...
UNK: No, I understand.
UNK: You've got that important thing.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Oh, of course
UNK: I'll tell him you love him.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Suit up!
UNK: He is always saying stuff like that!
UNK: He hung up, didn't he? Yeah.
UNK: See, I told you. We're not friends anymore.
UNK: What did he say?
UNK: Ah, a hundred and thir... What?
UNK: You...
UNK: I'm coming, ted.
UNK: So, what made you change your mind about stella?
UNK: Well, I was in the cab, and the car was coming at me,
UNK: And you know how they say that your whole life flashes
UNK: Before your eyes in a near-death experience?
UNK: It doesn't.
UNK: You don't see everything.
