UNK: Hup!
UNK: Are you sure?
UNK: Yeah, dude. Why do you think I had them set it this way?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Ow!
UNK: Worth it.
UNK: Barney, you, uh...
UNK: You could've died.
UNK: Ted, I'm sorry I broke the bro code.
UNK: No, I'm-I'm sorry.
UNK: Ted, can we be friends again?
UNK: Barney, come on, we're... We're more than friends.
UNK: We're brothers.
UNK: You're my brother, ted. You're my
UNK: Brother, barney.
UNK: Did you hear that, marshall?
UNK: We're brothers now.
UNK: Marshall's my brother, too.
UNK: We're all brothers.
UNK: Yeah, but I'm your best brother, right?
UNK: And that's how your uncle barney
UNK: It got pretty mushy and embarrassing after that.
UNK: Let's skip ahead.
UNK: I had to look away because if I watched
UNK: What the paramedics were about to do,
UNK: I would have passed out.
UNK: Then they took out this
UNK: Electric blade thing and I kept thinking,
UNK: "this isn't happening. This isn't happening."
UNK: Oh, my god. What did they cut?
UNK: My suit.
UNK: My beautiful suit.
UNK: But you're alive, and, and ted's alive.
UNK: This is amazing!
UNK: Two miracles in one day.
UNK: What is the matter with you?
UNK: How can you possibly be this cynical?!
UNK: You want to know? Yeah.
UNK: You really want to know? Yeah!
UNK: Fine.
UNK: When I was a kid,
UNK: I had this dog, sir scratchawan.
UNK: Anyway, sir scratchawan got really old,
UNK: So my parents decided to put him down.
UNK: It was the toughest day of my young life.
UNK: Good-bye, sir scratchawan.
UNK: I love you.
UNK: And when they took him to the vet,
UNK: He told them that earlier that very day,
UNK: He had learned about an experimental procedure
UNK: Called a canine/testudine cerebro-xenograft.
UNK: Ever heard of it?
UNK: No.
UNK: Well, it saved sir scratchawan's life.
UNK: He lived another seven years.
UNK: Miracle. Except for one...
UNK: Kind of big side effect from the surgery.
UNK: Sir scratchawan!
UNK: Welcome home!
UNK: He turned into a turtle.
UNK: I know. It's weird, right?
UNK: Apparently, a very common complication
UNK: From canine/testudine cerebro-xenografts.
UNK: And he didn't seem to remember any of his old tricks.
UNK: Go get it, scratchy.
UNK: Go get it!
UNK: Go get it! Get it!
UNK: Go get it, scratchy.
UNK: Go get it.
UNK: How long was it before...?
UNK: Longer than I'm proud of, lily.
UNK: Longer than I'm proud of.
UNK: And that's when I realized
UNK: Miracles ain't real.
UNK: Excuse me.
UNK: Mosby, you're still here?
UNK: Your tests came back, like, an hour ago. You're fine.
UNK: Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me?!
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: I guess it was rude of me to keep resuscitating that guy
UNK: With a rake sticking out of his chest.
UNK: Um, I have to go right now. Barney, I...
UNK: Go.
UNK: Run, ted. Run.
UNK: If there's anything I've taught you over the years, it's...
UNK: Barney, he left. Oh.
UNK: Hey, ted said that right before the accident,
UNK: His life flashed before his eyes.
UNK: You know, all the stuff he loves.
UNK: Did that happen to you? Oh, yeah.
UNK: I know what he saw : Boobs. Scotch.
UNK: And money.
UNK: Suits. A suit of money.
UNK: A suit of boobs.
UNK: A giant boob wearing a suit of money.
UNK: And the boob is lactating scotch.
UNK: I guess that's pretty much everything you love, right?
UNK: Yeah, pretty much.
Narrator : Kids, a lot of weird, random things
UNK: Have happened in my life,
UNK: But that car accident is one of the few
UNK: That I'd call a miracle, not because of what happened,
UNK: But because of what happened next.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Can I talk to you?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: I got you this orange kangaroo.
UNK: Uh... Thanks.
UNK: So I've been thinking about what changed
UNK: From the moment I broke up with you
UNK: To the moment I knew I wanted you back.
UNK: And, um, I think I finally figured out what happened.
UNK: Your cab got t-boned by a jackass on a cell phone?
UNK: No. I changed.
UNK: I'm ready to give you what you need.
UNK: That's why I spent
UNK: Ten minutes on the damn claw machine
UNK: Trying to get the big, fake diamond ring.
UNK: But all I could get was this orange kangaroo.
UNK: Diamond ring?
UNK: Will you marry me?
