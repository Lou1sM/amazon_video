UNK: Hey.
UNK: Is there any beer in the fridge?
UNK: It's 10 : 00 in the morning.
UNK: Grab me one.
UNK: So,
UNK: Something bad just happened.
UNK: Stella and I were out having breakfast.
UNK: So, my sister broke up with her boyfriend.
UNK: Well, I can finally say it.
UNK: I hated that guy!
UNK: Everything out of his mouth is,
UNK: "I'm a vegan.
UNK: "Fish feel pain.
UNK: I'm never constipated."
UNK: The guy's an idiot.
UNK: Actually, she's marrying him.
UNK: I just wanted your honest opinion.
UNK: He's actually a really nice guy.
UNK: I think there's a wisdom to...
UNK: Anyway, they picked a date, so, uh,
UNK: You want to come with me,
UNK: So that we can laugh our asses off
UNK: As we watch him walk barefoot down the aisle
UNK: In a hemp tuxedo?
UNK: Yeah, sure. When is it?
UNK: Uh, first weekend in November.
UNK: Is that
UNK: The something bad?
UNK: That she invited you to a wedding?
UNK: Six months from now.
UNK: As in we'll be together six months from now.
UNK: Do you guys remember
UNK: Barney's whole thing about making plans
UNK: In a relationship?
UNK: Fourth row.
UNK: Ted, no.
UNK: You're violating the date-time continuum.
UNK: You never make
UNK: Plans with a girl further in the future
UNK: Than the amount of time you've been going out.
UNK: You've been dating this girl for, what, two weeks?
UNK: No, you're not taking her to a springsteen concert in January.
UNK: By that time you won't even remember this robin girl's name.
UNK: Ugh, man, I love springsteen!
UNK: He's like the american bryan adams.
UNK: Well...
UNK: But
UNK: Barney had a point.
UNK: As soon as she started talking about the wedding,
UNK: It freaked me out.
UNK: Oh, that sounds like so much fun.
UNK: Mmm. So I get to look forward to it
UNK: For six months.
UNK: Which is twice as long as we've been dating.
UNK: Uh-oh.
UNK: I'm sure your daughter lucy'll come
UNK: So it'll be like a... A family trip.
UNK: Our first trip as our funny little family.
UNK: So that... That'll be super-exciting.
UNK: Oh, boy.
UNK: Man, they crank up the heat in these places.
UNK: What's going on, ted?
UNK: We need to talk.
UNK: Oh. Oh. Oh.
UNK: "We need to talk"?
UNK: There's only two situations where you say that to someone
UNK: And unless you're pregnant,
UNK: It sounds like you broke up with her.
UNK: Yeah, I did.
UNK: So how did she take it?
UNK: Um...
UNK: I'm only trying to be honest with you.
UNK: You know, ted. I have to go to work.
UNK: Stella, can we just...
UNK: I don't want to leave it like this.
UNK: No, ted, it's okay.
UNK: We're good.
UNK: Ow!
UNK: Look, I know it sounds rough,
UNK: But stella's a mom.
UNK: I have to be responsible.
UNK: If I'm having these
UNK: Feelings now, what if they don't go away?
UNK: What if they just get worse and worse
UNK: And six months from now, I break up with her
UNK: Over tofu salmon at her sister's wedding?
UNK: I can't do that
UNK: To her. And I definitely can't do that
UNK: To her daughter.
UNK: It sucks, but I'm being the good guy here.
UNK: This is the right decision.
UNK: Which brings me back to the cab ride.
UNK: Hello, may I speak with marshall eriksen?

UNK: âª
