UNK: Ted is, uh, very good.
Robin : I'm sure he will get you where you need to go.
Robin : Can I buy your bags online?
UNK: Oh, oh, I see what's going on here, ted.
UNK: Blah-blah : I'm just some random girl to make robin jealous,
UNK: Blah-blah : And after she takes you back,
UNK: Blah-blah : You probably won't even remember my name.
Ted : Come on, blahblah, it's not like that.
Barney : Well, we're closing in on the half.
UNK: Let's see how blahblah is doing on the crazy/hot scale.
Barney : She started the night here, but as the night's progressed,
Barney : She's gotten crazier but no hotter,
Barney : Which has caused her to drift across the mendoza diagonal
Barney : And dangerously close to the shelly gilespie zone.
Barney : Another girl I dated...
UNK: She gained 20 pounds and tried to kill me with a brick.
Ted : I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously,
Robin : There's nothing going on with me and robin.
UNK: Blah-blah : Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night?
UNK: Blah-blah : I mean, look at her.
UNK: Blah-blah : She's laughing at me right now.
UNK: I'm sorry, it's just, you know,
UNK: Blah-blah : Lily and marshall's story is so romantic.
UNK: Blah-blah : I just wish we had something like that.
UNK: Well, their story's not as magical as it seems.
UNK: College Marshall : What do you mean?
UNK: No, I, I can't, it's, it's kind of a secret.
UNK: Blah-blah : Well, how about I tell you a little secret
UNK: Blah-blah : About what you might get to do later tonight?
Ted : The night before lily met marshall... Uh-huh.
Ted : There was this party.
Ted : Hey.
UNK: College Ted : You a freshwoman?
UNK: I never use the word "freshman."
UNK: College Ted : Sexist.
UNK: Yeah, I'm a first year.
UNK: College Lily : I'm in hewitt 220.
UNK: College Ted : No way. Hewitt 110.
UNK: College Ted : You should totally come by.
UNK: College Lily : Maybe I will, hewitt 110.
Crowd : Chug! Chug! Chug!
UNK: Chug! Chug! Chug!
UNK: Chug! Chug! Chug!
UNK: Look at these drunk idiots.
UNK: College Ted : Hey, don't drink their two-dollar beer.
UNK: College Ted : This is a pinot noir.
UNK: College Ted : From europe.
UNK: Ooh.
UNK: College Lily : Oh, it's fruity.
UNK: College Ted : Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice.
UNK: It was pretty strong.
UNK: College Lily : So, uh...
UNK: College Lily : Do you have a girlfriend?
Robin : Yeah.
UNK: College Ted : Not sure about the whole "long distance" thing, though.
UNK: College Ted : It's like descartes says.
UNK: College Ted : "In order to determine
UNK: "whether there is anything we can know with certainty,
UNK: College Ted : We first have to doubt everything we know."
UNK: College Ted : You know?
UNK: Blah-blah : Wow.
UNK: But as drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning,
Ted : She still remembered room 110.
Ted : That's why she knocked on the door.
Ted : She was looking for me.
UNK: Blah-blah : Oh, my god.
Ted : Yeah, and in all these years,
Ted : Lily and I have never even spoken about it,
UNK: So again, mum's the word, okay?
UNK: Blah-blah : You have to tell marshall.
UNK: No, if, if he heard that, it would destroy him.
UNK: Blah-blah : If you don't tell him...
UNK: College Lily : I will.
Ted : Oh, come on, you wouldn't.
Ted : Oh, no.
UNK: Blah-blah : So, lily, how did you and ted meet?
UNK: Blah-blah : Come on, lily, the real story.
Ted : I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.
UNK: Aw, don't be embarrassed, ted, it was a long time ago.
UNK: : And I made a huge mistake last night,
UNK: College Ted : But it's like descartes says.
UNK: College Ted : "In order to determine whether there is anything
UNK: "we can know with certainty,
UNK: College Ted : We first have to doubt everything we know."
UNK: College Ted : And I now know for certain that I love you, karen.
UNK: College Ted : Anyway, call me back when you get this.
UNK: College Ted : I'm also going down to the computer center
UNK: College Ted : To send you an electronic mail.
