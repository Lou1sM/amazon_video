UNK: About five years ago,
UNK: I realized there was an emptiness inside of me
UNK: That no amount of meaningless sex could fill.
UNK: I needed something more.
UNK: And that's when I discovered indian casinos.
UNK: Hey, barney,
UNK: It's weird not seeing you in a suit. What's going on?
UNK: Uh, not much. My entire sexual history
UNK: Was built on a rotting foundation of lies.
UNK: My whole identity is lost in a pit of menthol ashes.
UNK: Work is good.
UNK: I'm never going back to that gym again.
UNK: Today at work, I had to have an intern
UNK: Rip up my bagel and put little pieces in my mouth.
UNK: Yeah, I'm done there, too.
UNK: That place is horrible.
UNK: What about your big muscular trainer
UNK: Who's so into stretching you out?
UNK: Yeah, well, turns out
UNK: That guy had no affiliation with the gym whatsoever.
UNK: Come on, guys, don't give up on the gym.
UNK: It's been great for us.
UNK: Like today, robin and I had a really nice moment.
UNK: Oh, god! Oh... Yahhh!
UNK: Robin, hey, I just wanted
UNK: To come over and thank you.
UNK: Thank me for what?
UNK: Well, you know how it's hard for exes to be friends
UNK: Because there's this lingering sexual tension between them?
UNK: Gone. Thank you.
UNK: You know, for all the crap you've given me,
UNK: I haven't seen you work up a sweat there once.
UNK: It's not true. I was there today.
UNK: Yeah, but didn't you leave early?
UNK: Oh, great.
UNK: Now I got to go home and charge this.
UNK: Wait a minute.
UNK: You didn't work out Tuesday either.
UNK: Brought the wrong shorts.
UNK: Yeah, and you totally disappeared on Monday, too.
UNK: No, I was at the gym the whole time.
UNK: Ooh! Oh, I love this gym.
UNK: Lily, help me bend down these three fingers.
UNK: Actually, I have an idea.
UNK: Do it! Come on! Do it, you worthless piece of crap!
UNK: Please! Please, I just want to go home.
UNK: Come on. This is your last set!
UNK: You said that last time!
UNK: Gone.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Rhonda.
UNK: I saw your friend ted at the gym.
UNK: After he puked and cleared the line at the smoothie bar,
UNK: He said you were kinda having a tough time.
UNK: Did you change your mind about having love, making sex,
UNK: Penis vagina?
UNK: What is the matter with me?
UNK: Oh, honey...
UNK: I just, I don't get it.
UNK: You slept with so many guys.
UNK: You slept with my brother.
UNK: We are practically the same person.
UNK: Was I really so bad?
UNK: Nobody's good the first time.
UNK: But I was. At least I thought I was.
UNK: Oh, barney, you know... Sex isn't everything.
UNK: When is the last time you had a conversation
UNK: With a woman with no intention of scoring with her?
UNK: I sat next to former secretary of state
UNK: Madeleine albright at a benefit once.
UNK: I certainly didn't intend to hit that.
UNK: Yeah, well, I tell you what.
UNK: Sleeping with me again isn't gonna solve anything.
UNK: I don't know what else is.
UNK: I think I know.
UNK: Do you have any kings?
UNK: No, go fish.
UNK: See, barney, isn't it nice to just sit
UNK: And have a evening with a woman, no agenda?
UNK: Just make nice conversation?
UNK: No.
UNK: Yeah, kinda sucks, doesn't it?
UNK: Oh, my god, barney, you really did just rock my world.
UNK: That was amazing.
UNK: And I'm not lying.
UNK: I know you're not lying, baby.
UNK: And it was good for you?
UNK: It was the best sex I've ever had.
UNK: Later.
UNK: Daddy's back.
UNK: Hey, buddy, how's it going?
UNK: Hey. Pretty good.
UNK: Pretty good. Ooh!
UNK: I can move my legs now and I can lift my arms this high.
UNK: Oh! Oh!
UNK: Yeah, you know, I feel like I have more energy.
UNK: Yeah, it was hard at first, but now if I go a day
UNK: Without working out, I miss it.
UNK: I'm proud of us, guys.
UNK: The first week is the hardest.
UNK: We're over the hump.
UNK: Joining that gym was the best decision we ever made.
UNK: And we never went back to the gym again.
