UNK: Okay, well, that's not cool.
UNK: You know, rhonda,
UNK: Running into you
UNK: Really got me thinking about the old days.
UNK: You were quite popular.
UNK: I sure got around back then.
UNK: And there was one young man who stood out above the pack.
UNK: Freddy chibatoni.
UNK: That kid had a tongue like a gecko.
UNK: No, no, I was thinking about someone else.
UNK: Chaz alderman.
UNK: Hips like a woman, but he knew how to use them.
UNK: What about me?!
UNK: You?
UNK: Yes. We slept together.
UNK: And you said I was the best you ever had.
UNK: Did I?
UNK: Oh, right.
UNK: About that...
UNK: And tell him that
UNK: He's the best you ever had.
UNK: Oh, I don't know.
UNK: He's just a kid.
UNK: No he isn't. He's 23 and he is really hurting, rhonda.
UNK: Please.
UNK: Maybe we could make a deal.
UNK: What?
UNK: I don't know...
UNK: Oh...
UNK: No, girl, I got a girlfriend.
UNK: Yeah, yeah, yeah, hers is the only vagina for me.
UNK: Oh... I love it.
UNK: It... It isn't scary at all.
UNK: Well, too bad.
UNK: I guess your brother's going to stay a virgin.
UNK: Fine.
UNK: Reggie jackson, reggie jackson,
UNK: Reggie jackson...
UNK: But those compliments you gave me.
UNK: Wow...
UNK: You just rocked my world.
UNK: That was the best sex I ever had.
UNK: But you said I rocked your world.
UNK: All subsequent
UNK: Worlds that I rocked
UNK: Were only so rocked because of the confidence I earned
UNK: From said first world rocking.
UNK: Sorry, barry.
UNK: It's barney.
UNK: So I'm doing sit-ups
UNK: And she says, "all right, marshall,"
UNK: So I summon all my strength and I do that set,
UNK: And then she says,
UNK: "give me another set."
UNK: So I'm like, "is this the last set?"
UNK: And she says yes.
UNK: So I do that set and then she says,
UNK: "give me another set."
UNK: She lied to my face!
UNK: Everything hurts.
UNK: Baby, the whole point of working out
UNK: Is to feel better.
UNK: This trainer is making you miserable.
UNK: You have to call her and quit.
UNK: I got to work through it. I got to finish what I started.
UNK: If you're too scared, I can call her.
UNK: Her number's on this card.
UNK: Hi. Is this trish?
UNK: This is marshall's wife.
UNK: Listen, we have a problem here and it's you.
UNK: I don't know who the hell you think you are,
UNK: But from now on, you don't tell marshall what to do.
UNK: You are an employee.
UNK: We tell you what to do.
UNK: And I'm telling you you're fired, bitch.
UNK: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, bye.
UNK: You better get down there, baby.
UNK: She's pretty pissed.
UNK: Hey, buddy.
UNK: Still bummed about the whole rhonda thing?
UNK: No. Why would I let the approval of one woman define who I am?
UNK: That's very mature of you, barney.
UNK: Let him finish.
UNK: When I can let the approval
UNK: Of a gaggle of supermodels
UNK: Define who I am. What? What?
UNK: Three tickets to the after party
UNK: Of the victoria's secret fashion show?
UNK: Uh, kablammie!
UNK: Lily, um, could I go?
UNK: Go. You're too sore to do anything anyway.
UNK: Oh... Wow.
UNK: Okay, this, boys, is not a regular season game.
UNK: This is the world series.
UNK: So remember, we work together. We're a team.
UNK: And if anyone sees heidi klum... dibs.
UNK: Ha-ah! Target acquired. Dig deep. Mm-hmm!
Ted : Excuse me. Excuse me.
UNK: Hey, it's a nice party, huh?
UNK: Yeah, it's great.
UNK: Do you guys work for the company?
UNK: Yeah, it's called
UNK: "I'm gonna get in your panties, incorporated."
UNK: Gross!
UNK: Dude!
UNK: I don't know. That was terrible.
UNK: I am so sorry.
UNK: Wait a minute. It's okay. It's okay. It's fine.
UNK: It's a numbers game. I'm cool.
UNK: Model... Model.
UNK: Uh... Hi.
