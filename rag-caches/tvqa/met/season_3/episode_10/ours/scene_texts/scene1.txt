UNK: I love it here.
UNK: It's just normal women who want to get in shape.
UNK: I don't have to put on makeup, do my hair,
UNK: Wear some trendy outfit.
UNK: Yeah, this place is great.
UNK: We're meeting our friend robin here.
UNK: I hope you don't hate her. She's pretty hot.
UNK: Shut up.
UNK: Lily, tell him to shut up.
UNK: I'm sorry, lesbian prison guard, do we know each other?
UNK: Ted, lily, you'll never believe what just happened.
UNK: Oh, hey, dude, I'm barney.
UNK: So I was at the smoothie bar...
UNK: What can I get you?
UNK: Oh, my god! Rhonda?
UNK: It's barney.
UNK: Barney stinson from staten island boulevard.
UNK: Hey, barney stinson from staten island boulevard.
UNK: What can I get you?
UNK: I can't believe she didn't remember me.
UNK: Why? Who is she?
UNK: That's rhonda.
UNK: I lost my virginity to her.
UNK: Aw, baby, are you still sore?
UNK: Trish made me do 70 push-ups,
UNK: But she only gave me credit for ten.
UNK: The she had me do 100 sit-ups
UNK: And then she made me cry, using only her words.
UNK: It just doesn't add up.
UNK: How could rhonda not remember me?
UNK: Well, maybe it wasn't that good for her.
UNK: I mean, it was your first time.
UNK: Ted, it's me.
UNK: I rocked her world.
UNK: You don't believe me? Okay, story time.
UNK: The year was 1998.
UNK: I'd been going out with shannon since freshman year of college.
UNK: We were saving ourselves.
UNK: So, when we broke up,
UNK: There I was, 23 and still a virgin.
UNK: I knew nothing about girls.
UNK: So I went to the guy
UNK: Who knew everything about girls... my brother james.
UNK: Wait, your gay brother james?
UNK: Yeah, this was before he was gay.
UNK: Barney...
UNK: Barney, you need to find a girl
UNK: And have sex with her asap.
UNK: That is what dudes do after a breakup.
UNK: I know. I want to, but... I guess I'm just scared.
UNK: Of course you're scared.
UNK: It's gross.
UNK: The thought of doing that with a woman...
UNK: But it's part of being a guy.
UNK: Try thinking about baseball.
UNK: Somehow I imagine those players on the field
UNK: And it's over a lot faster.
UNK: But I don't know the first thing about seducing a woman.
UNK: What do you...? How do you...?
UNK: Where do you...?
UNK: Stop. Don't overthink it.
UNK: You don't want to get the yips.
UNK: The yips?
UNK: Yeah, when you overthink simple things so much
UNK: That you can't do them at all.
UNK: The yips.
UNK: Yeah, it happens to athletes all the time.
UNK: Like the second baseman who suddenly can't throw to first
UNK: Or the figure skater who does a perfect triple toe loop
UNK: And then loses it on the arabesque.
UNK: I've actually really been getting into
UNK: Figure skating lately.
UNK: But, james...
UNK: What woman's gonna want to have sex with me?
UNK: It's not like I'm a backstreet boy.
UNK: The man maker.
Barney : Rhonda "man maker" french
UNK: Was our mom's friend from down the street.
UNK: Got any kings?
UNK: Go fish.
UNK: So, patty, know that new paperboy?
UNK: I let him throw one into my hedges, if you know what I mean.
UNK: Did you see that new guy who cleans my pool?
UNK: I let him snake my drain, if you know what I mean.
UNK: You know that chinese food delivery boy?
UNK: I had sex with him.
UNK: I don't have a funny way of saying it yet.
UNK: It just happened 20 minutes ago.
UNK: Of course.
UNK: The man maker.
UNK: And it'll be easier too,
UNK: 'cause she knows me so well.
UNK: Hi, barry.
UNK: Barney.
UNK: Hi, ms. French.
UNK: I know we haven't seen each other for a while,
UNK: But if there was any chance...
UNK: Oh, boy.
UNK: Wow, you just rocked my world.
UNK: That was the best sex I ever had.
Barney : That was the night I was born.
UNK: I rose like a phoenix from her mentholated bosom
UNK: And strode into the world,
UNK: Armani-clad
UNK: And fully awesome.
UNK: God, please let me stop!
UNK: Yes, great, let's stop.
UNK: Let's just kick back and wait for the massive coronary
UNK: You're going to have a couple years from now
UNK: When you're 40.
UNK: I'm... I'm 29.
