Ted : Kids, back in 2007, it seemed like everyone belonged
UNK: To these silly things called gyms.
UNK: The idea was you'd pay them lots of money
UNK: To run around and lift heavy things.
UNK: Biggest rip-off in the world.
UNK: And yet people fell for it.
UNK: Including me.
UNK: Oh, forgot my wallet.
UNK: It started with one of those moments
UNK: When you realize you're not as in shape
UNK: As you want to be.
UNK: Whoo...
UNK: That's further than it looks.
UNK: Aw, coupon's on my dresser.
UNK: That's too far. Forget it.
UNK: Please don't judge me.
UNK: I wound up shame-eating the whole pizza.
UNK: I woke up all greasy and sweaty.
UNK: My sheets looked like what they wrap deli sandwiches in.
UNK: Maybe I should join a gym.
UNK: Do you go to a gym?
UNK: Well, I go to total rip fitness, but I don't work out there.
UNK: What do you do?
UNK: I invest.
UNK: There goes one of my investments now.
UNK: Cheryl, hard work's paying off.
UNK: Keep up the good work.
UNK: So your investments are women?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Women who, how shall I put this delicately?
UNK: They fat.
UNK: So, I come here,
UNK: Give them lots of attention now.
UNK: Then when they get hot, who's the first guy they run to?
UNK: The one who invested in them when they weren't.
UNK: Wow, I can't decide if I'm thoroughly disgusted
UNK: Or really, really impressed.
UNK: Of course, not all investments pay dividends.
UNK: See the girl over there at the vending machine... tonya.
UNK: She is one kit kat away from junk bond status.
UNK: Hey, barney.
UNK: Becky, elliptical machine's
UNK: Really working for you. Nice stuff.
UNK: That one's going to reward shareholders soon.
UNK: I foresee aggressive growth in my future.
UNK: What up?
UNK: Wow, that makes me want to join a gym.
UNK: So I can get super strong
UNK: And punch you really hard in the face.
UNK: Yes, we should all do it.
UNK: Yeah, let's all punch barney in the face.
UNK: No, I'm serious.
UNK: We should totally join a gym.
UNK: Come on, we put on
UNK: The beer weight together...
UNK: Might as well take it off together.
UNK: Or we could just stop drinking beer.
UNK: No. I say we join a gym.
UNK: Are you marshall? Yeah.
UNK: Hi, I'm trish.
UNK: I'm the trainer you signed up for.
UNK: Oh, hi.
UNK: Really great
UNK: To meet you, trish.
UNK: It's a pleasure.
UNK: Marshall, can I talk to you for a second?
UNK: Sure. Great.
UNK: Just a second.
UNK: Yeah, sweetie, I think
UNK: She maybe just a little too hot to be your trainer.
UNK: I get it.
UNK: I mean, I see what you're worried about.
UNK: But this is just about me taking care of myself.
UNK: You'll always be my sugar.
UNK: So, marshall, are you ready
UNK: To make a commitment to your body?
UNK: Pssh! Please, I'm all about committing to my body.
UNK: I'll drive to vermont and have a commitment ceremony
UNK: To my body if you want.
UNK: That was a weird thing to say.
UNK: All right. Start with 100 push-ups.
UNK: All right, cool. How many do you want me to do? 100.
UNK: Oh, I thought that was a figure of speech... 100 push-ups,
UNK: Like do a bazillion push-ups.
UNK: No one can do 100.
UNK: Do you smell that?
UNK: No.
UNK: It smells like there's a little bitch in my gym.
UNK: Are you being a little bitch in my gym?
UNK: No.
UNK: Then get on the floor and give me 100!
UNK: You don't have to yell at me.
