Marshall : Um... Today, lily did something great.
Marshall : Not only did she gather us all here together
Marshall : And cook a delicious meal,
Marshall : But she also started a new tradition.
Marshall : We're gonna do this again next year,
Marshall : And the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives.
Marshall : I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it.
Marshall : And it's all thanks to you, lily.
Marshall : I love you.
Marshall : So, to the first of many thanksgivings together.
Bob : This is rad!
Bob : A nice, small, simple thanksgiving.
