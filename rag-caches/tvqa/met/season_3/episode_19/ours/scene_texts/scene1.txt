UNK: Something kinda strange had been happening
UNK: Ted from 2030 : To your uncle barney.
UNK: He'd be doing great with a woman...
UNK: So I throw the pressurized oxygen tank in his mouth,
UNK: I shoot the tank, boom!
UNK: No more shark.
UNK: Mr. Holland and I swim back to shore.
UNK: Let me freshen your drink.
