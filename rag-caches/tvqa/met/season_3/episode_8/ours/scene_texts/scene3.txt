UNK: Right.
UNK: Time.
UNK: Sir. I know.
UNK: Your time is... I know it is.
UNK: Give me...!
UNK: Now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled
UNK: To post online at 10 : 00,
UNK: And it was 9 : 59.
UNK: Damn, they're not up yet.
UNK: Oh, don't worry, baby. I'm sure you rocked it.
UNK: I mean, how many people fail the bar?
UNK: Half.
UNK: Oh, my god, half?
UNK: Only half the people pass?
UNK: I mean, half the people pass.
UNK: That's fantastic.
UNK: Go, marshall.
UNK: Oh, hey, can I jump on there?
UNK: I want to show you something awesome. What?
UNK: No. Bar results. My future.
UNK: Trust me. You need to see this.
UNK: What is so important that I need to see it right now?
UNK: It's a video of a dog pooping on a baby.
UNK: How do I need to see that?
UNK: Why would I want to see that?
UNK: In what possible way could subjecting my eyes and my brain
UNK: To something that disgusting enrich my life?
UNK: It's a dog pooping on a baby.
UNK: Get away from my computer.
UNK: Okay, just do a quick Google search for "caca spaniel."
UNK: The results are in.
UNK: Whoo. What's it say?
UNK: "Input password."
All : Input the password.
UNK: It's okay. They assigned it to me when I took the test.
UNK: It's gotta be around here somewhere.
UNK: Here. Here-here-here.
UNK: Jelly beans, fluffernutter, gummi bears, ginger snap...
UNK: This is a grocery list.
UNK: For who? A witch building a house in the forest?
UNK: Sugar helps me study.
UNK: This is like the shopping a ten-year-old does
UNK: When his parents leave him alone for the weekend.
UNK: What parent leaves a ten- year-old alone for the weekend?
UNK: And your mom was perfect.
UNK: I can't find my password! Okay, just...
UNK: Can't you let 'em know that you lost it
UNK: And they'll e-mail it to you or something?
UNK: No! They won't let me do that.
UNK: I'm gonna have to wait till the results come
UNK: In the regular mail.
UNK: That could be weeks from now, if ever!
UNK: Our mail carrier hates me ever since I asked her
UNK: When the baby was due.
UNK: She wasn't pregnant?
UNK: No, he was not.
UNK: Ooh. Okay, well, that's a drag,
UNK: But the results will come eventually.
UNK: Just try to keep it off your mind until then.
UNK: Hey, brad.
UNK: Oh, congratulations, man.
UNK: I'm, uh... I'm not sure yet.
UNK: I lost my password.
UNK: That's great, cara.
UNK: I don't know yet. I lost my password.
UNK: I don't know how I lost it!
UNK: This stuff happens!
UNK: Oh. Ohh! You're one to talk.
UNK: You misplace stuff all the time.
UNK: I'm sorry.
UNK: I'm sure the nurses are stealing your medicine, grandma.
UNK: Love you, too.
UNK: If I have to wait six weeks to find out if I passed,
UNK: I-I'm gonna have a heart attack.
UNK: Based on that grocery list, I'd say diabetes is a bigger worry.
UNK: You know what? Laugh all you want.
UNK: This affects my whole future, all right?
UNK: I probably shouldn't be telling you this.
UNK: I definitely shouldn't be telling you this,
UNK: But there is a way I can help you with your problem.
UNK: How?
UNK: I know a guy at work.
UNK: He can get access to software designed to penetrate firewalls
UNK: And retrieve passwords through secure servers.
UNK: I can get into any computer.
UNK: So what do we do? Like, arrange a secret meeting
UNK: In a darkened parking structure?
UNK: No.
UNK: Can we?
UNK: No.
UNK: I have a trench coat.
UNK: Dude, be cool.
UNK: So, I just got off the phone with cathy.
UNK: God, you guys are so right.
UNK: I totally hear it now.
UNK: See it now?
UNK: Smell it?
UNK: What is it?!
UNK: I left the table for two minutes.
UNK: What could she have possibly done
UNK: In that time that was so horrible? Was it...
UNK: I'll be back in one second.
UNK: One time, in tenth grade, as a joke, I told everyone
