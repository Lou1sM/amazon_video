UNK: That my english teacher had sex with me.
UNK: He's still in jail.
UNK: Or maybe...
UNK: I'll be back in a second.
UNK: So I volunteer at the pound.
UNK: Oh, isn't that nice?
UNK: Yeah. You can't imagine the rush you get
UNK: From killing an unwanted puppy.
UNK: I make bracelets out of the collars.
UNK: Or...
UNK: I'll be back in one second.
UNK: I bet he's going to the urinal.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I remember when I had a penis.
UNK: It wasn't anything she did while you were in the bathroom.
UNK: It's just the way she is.
UNK: I don't get it. If it's so obvious
UNK: And you guys all see it, how come I don't?
UNK: 'Cause we're not trying to have sex with her.
UNK: Mmm. Brother,
UNK: You're driving the "I want to have sex with her" truck,
UNK: And it's got a huge blind spot.
UNK: That's ridiculous.
UNK: Is it really?
UNK: Ted, let me tell you a little story
UNK: About a young lady I wanted to have sex with... lucilia.
UNK: On a white sand beach in rio de janeiro,
UNK: We made love for ten straight hours.
UNK: When we were done,
UNK: She applauded
UNK: And told me I was far, far better
UNK: Than the best lover she could possibly imagine,
UNK: And that I had restored her faith in god.
UNK: What does this have to do with cathy?
UNK: Who's cathy?
UNK: Just tell me what the hell
UNK: Is wrong with her already.
UNK: Okay. You want to know?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: You want to shatter
UNK: This beautiful illusion you've created for yourself?
UNK: Fine. Here it is.
UNK: Cathy talks... A lot.
UNK: Oh, come on.
UNK: That's not true.
UNK: Ted. Really, really think about that dinner
UNK: We all just had together.
UNK: And I did.
UNK: So, what's everyone getting?
UNK: Well, I can't decide.
UNK: Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?
UNK: I like chicken.
UNK: I like lasagna. I like them both,
UNK: But I really like pork.
UNK: A lot of people don't
UNK: Eat pork, and maybe it's because
UNK: Of that movie babe or something.
UNK: But that was funny.
UNK: He was a talking pig
UNK: And he was like "bah, ram, ewe!"
UNK: What-what if
UNK: There was a sorority, "bah, ram, ewe?"
UNK: I'd totally rush it.
UNK: And so I named him dr. Seuss!
UNK: Lorax is a funny word.
UNK: Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!
UNK: Oh, you guys just got a new place.
UNK: How many bedrooms
UNK: Is it?
UNK: I would love
UNK: To have an extra bedroom,
UNK: Because I would put a stairmaster in there.
UNK: But you guts should get a convertible sofa.
UNK: Or a futon. Futons are great.
UNK: Or what about one of those
UNK: Murphy beds?
UNK: Who invented the murphy bed?
UNK: Was it a guy named murphy?
UNK: Oh, my god.
UNK: Do you guys remember that show murphy brown?
UNK: That was a funny show.
UNK: She had a new assistant every episode.
UNK: And it was like a half an hour
UNK: Before I realized he wasn't even on the phone anymore!
UNK: Isn't that hysterical?
UNK: Two! It's two bedrooms!
UNK: Hey, do you guys like cannolis?
UNK: Because I know this place and it's in the south bronx
UNK: And you wouldn't expect it,
UNK: But they have the best cannolis in town.
UNK: And just like that, the illusion was shattered.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: She just never shuts up, does she?
UNK: She didn't stop to swallow her food.
UNK: I was scared for her.
UNK: I didn't want her to choke.
UNK: At first.
UNK: So kids, this girl I was dating would not stop talking.
UNK: Can you imagine how awful that is?
UNK: I'm so glad that we're staying in tonight, because the thing
UNK: About going out is that you have so many...
UNK: Do you own a wok? Because what's really...
UNK: Don't you just love autumn?
UNK: Today I'm dressed for...
UNK: Oh, my god. You're the sweetest...
UNK: This great place where we can go.
