UNK: They have guys' and girls' clothes.
UNK: We could both shop at the same time.
UNK: And a lot of times boyfriends and girlfriends...
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Why are you running so fast?
UNK: Well, thank you, pal.
UNK: You and your little friends,
UNK: You just had to tell me.
UNK: You just had to give in to my incessant begging.
UNK: You said that you wanted to know.
UNK: I didn't want to know!
UNK: You said you wanted to know!
UNK: Well, I didn't know I didn't want to know!
UNK: You knew. And you know me.
UNK: And you should have known I didn't want to know!
UNK: You know?
UNK: I'm sorry we told you.
UNK: I'm surprised she didn't tell you herself at some point.
UNK: There's only a finite combination of words
UNK: In the english language.
UNK: Well, you could have let me enjoy it a little longer.
UNK: She's got all these
UNK: Other great qualities.
UNK: She's smart. She's caring. She loves animals...
UNK: You know how to teach her a lesson? Buy her a parrot.
UNK: Oh, come on. I'm sorry that we told you, okay?
UNK: It's part of being in a relationship.
UNK: Eventually, you get used to these annoying little things
UNK: That bug you at first.
UNK: Yeah, I guess.
UNK: I mean, you got used to lily's loud chewing, right?
UNK: Lily doesn't chew loudly.
UNK: Dude...
UNK: Come on. This isn't news.
UNK: Why do you think I call her "chewbacca"?
UNK: I assumed because she's loyal, wears shiny belts
UNK: And I resemble a young harrison ford.
UNK: Think about it.
UNK: Oh, man, honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing
UNK: You've ever done to me.
UNK: I really thought you knew.
UNK: We had ribs the other night. It sounded like jurassic park.
UNK: Ha-ha-ha-ha. You know what?
UNK: It doesn't matter.
UNK: But it did.
UNK: Say, what's in that cereal
UNK: Besides dry twigs and small animal bones?
UNK: What's that supposed to mean?
UNK: Lily, I love you, but honest to god,
UNK: When you eat, it sounds like a garbage disposal
UNK: Full of drywall screws.
UNK: What's the matter with you?
UNK: We've been together ten years, and you're saying this now?
UNK: Well, I never noticed it before until...
UNK: Until what?
UNK: Can you believe ted?
UNK: What a lame thing to say,
UNK: That I'm a loud chewer.
UNK: Yeah, that's crazy.
UNK: Maybe enough with the pretzels.
UNK: Oh, my god, do I really chew that loudly?
UNK: No, no, no.
UNK: Okay, now that you pointed it out,
UNK: Maybe it does sound slightly like someone put
UNK: A screwdriver in a pencil sharpener,
UNK: But in a cute way.
UNK: This is all ted's fault.
UNK: Oh, like he's so perfect, mr. Corrector.
UNK: What do you mean?
UNK: Oh, come on. You dated the guy for a year
UNK: And you never noticed that most of what ted says

UNK: This is a facial tissue.
UNK: Oh, my god, is frankenstein gonna kill that little girl?
UNK: Uh, dr. Frankenstein isn't in this scene.
UNK: That's frankenstein's monster.
UNK: That literally blew my mind.
UNK: Figuratively.
UNK: Oh, my god, you're right.
UNK: That is so annoying.
UNK: Isn't it?
UNK: Where are those pretzels from, ace hardware?
UNK: Hey, man, do you like kettle corn?
UNK: I'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy.
UNK: Are the blinds closed?
UNK: I don't know.
UNK: Are the blinds closed?!
UNK: Yes, the blinds are closed. Now, what...?
