UNK: Don't they teach vocabulary in canada?
UNK: They literally don't. They literally don't.
UNK: Shut up, marshall. That's nothing compared
UNK: To your thing of singing what you do all the time.
UNK: âª Paying my bills, using return address labels âª
UNK: âª From a charity that I haven't given money to âª
UNK: âª Writing a check 'cause now I feel guilty âª
UNK: âª The salivation army does not fight fair. âª
UNK: âª Heading down to the basement today âª
UNK: âª With my laundry and a roll of quarters âª
UNK: âª But I'm back too soon
UNK: âª 'cause I left the room without detergent âª
UNK: âª And the fabric softener
Ted : Wow. That is annoying.
UNK: Those rhymes are so sloppy.
UNK: Oh, come on!
UNK: What about you, "barney"?
UNK: Okay, you...
UNK: Always... Ah!
UNK: Interesting, interesting,
UNK: Everyone has annoying habits but me.
UNK: Oh, got it.
UNK: Okay, you sometimes talk in a weird high-pitched voice.
UNK: And you're constantly using lame catchphrases.
UNK: And sometimes you space out and don't even pay attention
UNK: To what we're talking about.
UNK: I'm sorry. What?
UNK: Oh, see?
UNK: You can't think of anything
UNK: âª 'cause I'm awesome!
UNK: All three right there.
UNK: Well, technically, "awesome" wouldn't be a catchphrase.
UNK: If anything, it's more of a catchword.
UNK: I literally want to rip your head off.
UNK: You mean "figuratively"!
UNK: No, I literally mean "literally."
UNK: literally, literally literally.
UNK: Oh, my god, lily, what are you eating, gravel?
UNK: Oh, I know, right?
UNK: It sounds like cufflinks going up a vacuum cleaner.
UNK: Well, why don't you sing about it?
UNK: âª Because I don't sing about everything I do... âª
UNK: No, no, sometimes you just sing nonsense sentences
UNK: Like a stroke victim,
UNK: And what's worse,
UNK: They're catchy.
UNK: âª Apple, orchard, banana, cat dance âª
All : âª 8663
UNK: See? We know that one because once you sang that
UNK: For, like, three hours. What the hell is that?
UNK: That's my password.
UNK: Aobcd8663.
UNK: Oh, marshall! Awesome!
UNK: There's another one.
UNK: It's called "golden reliever," where this dog... Yeah,
UNK: We can guess. All right, guys,
UNK: Guys, guys.
UNK: I'm a lawyer.
UNK: And just like that
UNK: We stopped fighting and celebrated marshall's success.
UNK: You see, when someone's bad habits are pointed out to you,
UNK: It's hard to ignore them.
UNK: âª I'm a lawyer now 'cause I passed the bar âª
UNK: âª I'm imposing marshall law on this champagne. âª
UNK: Are you literally on cloud nine right now?
UNK: Baby, you never have to take the bar again.
UNK: Actually, if he practices law in another state,
UNK: He will have to,
UNK: But new york, man!
UNK: It's a great state to practice law in!
UNK: Lawsuit up!
UNK: Yeah! Whoo!
UNK: Yeah! Yeah!
UNK: But if you love them enough,
UNK: Those bad habits are easy to forget.
UNK: Three years later, I ran into cathy, and she was doing well.
UNK: Ted?! Oh, my god, I haven't seen you in so long!
UNK: How long has it been? Three years? No, four years.
UNK: No, three years, 'cause I went blonde and then I went back
UNK: 'cause I was having too much fun.
UNK: You know, it's true what they say : Blondes have more fun.
UNK: Oh, my god, I'm being so rude. Ted, this is my fiancÃ©.
UNK: Yes, I'm engaged. Ted, this is daniel.
UNK: Great...
UNK: You guys
UNK: Seem perfect for each other.
UNK: Oh, my god. I know, right?
UNK: Totally, it was like love at first sight.
UNK: Hey, we should go out sometime.
UNK: Are you seeing anyone? Because we could double-date.
UNK: Would that be weird? No, it's not weird. We can go
UNK: Have brunch down the street. I know this place.
UNK: Do you guys like popovers? Because I love popovers.
UNK: They're like croissants, but they're a little bit
UNK: Less flaky and they're kind of round.
UNK: Hey, they have strawberry jam.
