UNK: She'll call back when she realizes I'm gone.
UNK: Probably in about 45 minutes.
UNK: Hey. Hi.
UNK: You guys want a drink?
UNK: I'll just have a water.
UNK: Mm, technically, water is a drink.
UNK: Really, professor?
UNK: You drink it? Is that how water works?
UNK: Because I was just gonna smear it on my skin
UNK: And hope I absorbed it.
UNK: Or you could, you know, pour it over your shirt.
UNK: What's with you?
UNK: You're always correcting people.
UNK: You totally do that! That's absolutely right.
UNK: Right? I never noticed it before,
UNK: And now it's literally driving me crazy.
UNK: Figuratively.
UNK: Okay, maybe so, but it's no worse
UNK: Than you using the word "literally"
UNK: In every other sentence.
UNK: You kind of do that. He's got a point.
