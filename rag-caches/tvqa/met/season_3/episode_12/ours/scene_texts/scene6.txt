UNK: No. Huh?
UNK: Okay...
UNK: I want you to hear exactly how it sounds, ted.
Recording : First skipped message.
Barney : I don't see no ring on this finger.
UNK: And then last night started coming back to me :
UNK: The real version.
UNK: Are the girls in there hotter than our dates?
UNK: I don't know if they're hotter,
UNK: But they're drunker.
UNK: Rock 'n' roll.
UNK: How many messages did I...?
UNK: Seventeen.
UNK: Kids, it's sometimes possible to think
UNK: You're doing just fine in life...
Recording : Next message.
UNK: Can you put it on my tab?
UNK: Sure, what's the last name?
UNK: Garrido.
UNK: And then someone opens your eyes a little bit,
UNK: And you realize...
Recording : Next message.
UNK: I really want to hook up with you,
UNK: Leave before breakfast, and then never see you again.
UNK: Your whole world is off balance...
Recording : Next message.
UNK: Out of whack...
UNK: Okay, look, brah,
UNK: There is a very simple explana...
UNK: Crooked.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: That was hard to listen to.
UNK: No one likes how they sound on an answering machine.
UNK: Thanks for doing that.
UNK: You yelled at me.
UNK: You got very firm with me.
UNK: Very confident.
UNK: It was cool.
UNK: You're very sexy when you yell, marshall.
UNK: Shut up.
UNK: Veins, crazy muscles in your neck.
UNK: You're like a kentucky derby-winning steed.
UNK: You're ruining a nice moment.
UNK: At one point, I swear, I thought we were gonna kiss.
UNK: Ted, seriously.
UNK: I'm married.
UNK: Oh... A slanted floor.
UNK: Architecturally speaking, fixing that's going to be...
UNK: Very, very, very expensive.
UNK: And it's gonna take some time, too,
UNK: So it looks like you're stuck with us
UNK: For a little while longer, if that's okay.
UNK: Are you kidding? I love it.
UNK: I don't know what's gonna happen to me without you guys around.
UNK: Where are you going?
UNK: I'm going to get my stupid phone.
UNK: So that was saint patrick's day, 2008.
UNK: I found out years later that your mom was at that party.
UNK: I just didn't meet her.
UNK: And it's a good thing I didn't, 'cause if I had met her,
UNK: I don't think she would have liked me.
UNK: Heck, I don't think I liked me.
UNK: But that's okay.
UNK: Tomorrow had arrived.
UNK: âª
UNK: âª
UNK: You see, I didn't know it yet,
UNK: But my luck was about to change.
UNK: âª
UNK: I'm awesome.
