UNK: No. The universe is telling us
UNK: That we have a free pass tonight.
UNK: The universe is saying
UNK: That we don't have to live in fear of the...
UNK: Are you still there?
UNK: Yeah, I'm here.
UNK: Of the repercussions of our actions.
UNK: There is no waiting for tomorrow,
UNK: Because do you know why, ted?
UNK: There is no tomorrow.
UNK: No tomorrow, huh?
UNK: By the way, mr. Garrido,
UNK: Second bottle of champagne gets you a complimentary ounce of caviar.
UNK: Enjoy.
UNK: No tomorrow!
UNK: No tomorrow!
All : No tomorrow!
UNK: Hey, I wonder what the grown-ups are doing right now.
UNK: Oh...
UNK: I win again.
UNK: Why do I keep winning?
UNK: Maybe your hippo is just hungrier hungrier than ours.
UNK: That's it. That's what it is.
UNK: It's not gravity, that's for sure.
UNK: I'll tell you that.
UNK: Whoa.
UNK: What was that?
UNK: What's going on here?
UNK: Okay, lily...
UNK: While you were in the other room, robin and I,
UNK: We discovered something about the apartment.
UNK: It's not a big deal.
UNK: It's not like a disaster. It's just...
UNK: It's something that we're going to have to learn to live with.
UNK: Robin and I saw a ghost.
UNK: What?
UNK: Oh, he's kidding, right?
UNK: No, we really saw a ghost.
UNK: What did it look like?
UNK: Uh, a sheet with two holes in it.
UNK: He was a confederate general
UNK: Who was wounded at the battle of antietam,
UNK: And he died at the army hospital,
UNK: Which once stood on this very spot.
UNK: And now he wanders these halls,
UNK: Vowing revenge against the union cannonade
UNK: That once felled him.
UNK: But he seems nice. He's a good-good guy.
UNK: Marshall, you see ghosts everywhere.
UNK: You see ghosts at starbucks.
UNK: That kenny g holiday cd just flew off the shelf.
UNK: Last time that happened.
UNK: But, robin, you're a skeptic,
UNK: So if you say you saw a ghost...
UNK: It passed right through me,
UNK: And suddenly I felt cold, so very cold.
UNK: You know, ashlee, I'm sorry.
UNK: You're probably just gonna want to get up and walk away,
UNK: But I just have to test out this theory
UNK: I've been working on.
UNK: Tonight, I'm not looking for a relationship.
UNK: I really just want to hook up with you,
UNK: Leave before breakfast, and never see you again.
UNK: I'm in.
UNK: Unbelievable.
UNK: Hot damn, that's a deep navel.
UNK: No tomorrow, ted.
UNK: Yeah, no tomorrow, barney.
UNK: No tomorrow, huh?
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: I like that idea.
UNK: Because if there is a tomorrow,
UNK: I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.
UNK: Oh, yeah? Why is that? Mm-hmm.
UNK: I'm married.
UNK: Tell me you're messing with me, guys.
UNK: You didn't actually see a ghost.
UNK: It's not a big deal, baby.
UNK: He seemed friendly.
UNK: You said he's a confederate general.
UNK: They're the bad guys.
UNK: And he's probably racist.
Marshall : No,
UNK: He seemed polite.
UNK: He had courtly southern manners.
UNK: We're gonna raise our kids here.
UNK: I don't want some confederate general ghost
UNK: Teaching them his racism.
UNK: He loves people of all colors
UNK: And creeds.
UNK: He was fighting for states' rights, that's all.
UNK: Robin said he was wearing a sheet.
UNK: What do you think that means?
UNK: The apartment is crooked.
UNK: What?
UNK: Robin and I didn't see a ghost.
UNK: The floor is crooked, isn't it?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: We spent our entire life's savings on this floor.
UNK: The next 30 mortgage-paying years of our lives
UNK: Will be spent on this floor, and it's crooked.
