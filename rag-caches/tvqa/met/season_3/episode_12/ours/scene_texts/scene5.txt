UNK: Because...
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry.
UNK: Oh, that's okay.
UNK: Um, dude, so, I'm having second thoughts about that theory.
UNK: I'm telling you,
UNK: If you want to know how old a woman is, check her elbows.
UNK: Not that theory.
UNK: You have to be more specific, ted,
UNK: 'cause I have so many theories.

UNK: There's three rules of cheating :
UNK: It's not cheating if you're not the one who's married,
UNK: It's not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels,
UNK: And it's not cheating if she's from a different area code.
UNK: You're fine on all three counts.
UNK: How do you know she's from a different area code?
UNK: She's 516.
UNK: She might dress like she's 718,
UNK: Act like she's 212, but trust me, she's 516.
UNK: Oh, and her husband...
UNK: Letting her out alone on saint patty's day?

UNK: This is a nightmare.
UNK: We can't raise our kids here.
UNK: They'll grow up slanted.
UNK: If we have a daughter, we'll have to call her eileen.
UNK: I don't think we can live here, marshall.

UNK: Ten bucks says I can do it backwards.
UNK: So lily and marshall decided
UNK: To make the best of a bad situation.
UNK: And that's also how the sport of apartment roller luge
UNK: Was invented.
Marshall : Be very careful!
UNK: Very, very... Oh, yeah!

UNK: Awesome, huh?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: You don't see anything wrong with that story?
UNK: Well, I lost my new phone back at the club somewhere.
UNK: What the hell is wrong with you, dude?
UNK: You know me, I lose things.
UNK: You kissed a married woman, ted.
UNK: You committed credit card fraud.
UNK: You... You kissed a married woman.
UNK: Do you know how offensive that is to me?
UNK: You're turning into barney.
UNK: We don't need another barney.
UNK: Look...
UNK: It's saint patty's day.
