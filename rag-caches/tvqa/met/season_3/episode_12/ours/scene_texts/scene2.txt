UNK: We got to ditch these girls.
UNK: But you dragged them all the way down here.
UNK: First skipped message : I don't see no ring on this finger.
UNK: All right, hold on.
UNK: Uh, excuse me?
UNK: Are the girls in there hotter than our dates?
UNK: I don't know if they're hotter,
UNK: But they're drunker.
UNK: Rock 'n' roll.
UNK: Welcome to your new dream home, my lady.
UNK: All right, all right.
UNK: You can put me down.
UNK: Robin thinks we're weird.
UNK: No, it's fine.
UNK: It was only weird on the subway.
UNK: Oh. I'm gonna check the other rooms
UNK: To see if the previous owners left us any free stuff.
UNK: I'm gonna hang our first piece of art.
UNK: Oh, look, there's already a nail.
UNK: Hey, lil, free nail!
Lily : Score!
UNK: How's that?
UNK: Perfect.
UNK: Whoops.
UNK: Oh, now this is ridiculous.
UNK: Is it the nail?
UNK: Marshall? Is the wall slippery or something?
UNK: Marshall. Is there a wind? Is there some sort of draft in here?
UNK: Marshall! What?
UNK: Your apartment's crooked.
UNK: What do you mean?
Ted : It was the kind of thing
UNK: You didn't notice until you noticed it.
UNK: But once you did notice it, you couldn't not notice it.
UNK: Lily and marshall's new apartment was crooked.
UNK: Oh, no!
UNK: Oh, no, no, no!
UNK: No!
UNK: Oh, no, no. Oh, no.
UNK: Yes. Are you telling me that we just spent
UNK: Our entire life savings and then some
UNK: On-on a crooked apartment?
Lily : Oh, my god!
UNK: No, she's gonna flip.
UNK: Just calm down. It's gonna be fine.
UNK: Look what I found in the kids' room!
UNK: Free skateboard. Score!
UNK: Free hungry hungry hippos.
UNK: Double score!
UNK: I'm gonna check the kitchen!
UNK: Okay. How could she not notice this?
UNK: It's like the last 20 minutes of titanic in here.
UNK: We have to keep this quiet.
UNK: If lily finds out her new dream house is crooked,
UNK: It's gonna... It's gonna break her heart.
UNK: Free salad strainer!
UNK: I love this place. Yay!
UNK: Just for tonight, okay?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: But it's gonna be an uphill battle.
UNK: I am just saying we have to think of the right angle.
UNK: I have a third one, but I'm not gonna say it.
UNK: Okay, barney, I think we've stumbled
UNK: Into some kind of ethical, philosophical wormhole.
UNK: Green suit. Yeah.
UNK: I ditched marshall and lily,
UNK: And was rewarded with two beautiful girls.
UNK: Suit's made of green.
UNK: We bailed on those two beautiful girls,
UNK: And now we're being rewarded with a sea of beautiful girls.
UNK: 38 long.
UNK: It's like...
UNK: It's like the laws of the universe are working in reverse.
UNK: Can you put it on my tab? Yeah. What's the last name?
UNK: Garrido.
UNK: All right, I'm gonna try something, and if this works...
UNK: Uh, hey. Hey, what can I get you guys?
UNK: A bottle of dom perignon, and can you put it on my tab?
UNK: Sure. What's the name?
UNK: Garrido. Dude!
UNK: Oh, uh, yeah, you're right.
UNK: Uh, make it two bottles.
UNK: Two.
UNK: Now we wait, see if something good happens... Oh! Hello!
UNK: St. Patrick's day tradition.
UNK: If you're not wearing green, you got to get pinched.
UNK: Well, I guess I got what I deserved.
UNK: I'm not wearing green, either.
UNK: This is, um, deep teal.
UNK: The lighting makes it...
UNK: Uh, I'm ted.
UNK: Ashlee with two "e" s.
UNK: Please. "c" s at most.
UNK: You know, you guys should come join me and my friends.
UNK: We have a bottle of tequila
UNK: And shockingly deep belly buttons.
UNK: Okay, it's official :
UNK: Okay, it's official : Do bad things, good things happen.
UNK: Shh!
UNK: Ted, listen.
UNK: Are you hearing that?
UNK: That's the universe.
UNK: The universe is talking to us.
UNK: We don't have to build a baseball field, do we?
