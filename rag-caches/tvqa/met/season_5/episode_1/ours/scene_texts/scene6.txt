UNK: Excuse me. Whoa.
Lily : 20 minutes late on your first day?
Lily : That's rough. Mm.
Ted : Yeah, but here's the funny thing.
UNK: By that point, I didn't have time
UNK: to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be.
UNK: I just got up there and talked about architecture.
Ted : And it was kind of great.
Lily : That's awesome, Ted. Yeah.
Marshall : Congratulations, buddy.
Ted : Thanks.
Robin : Nice job, Ted.
Barney : Hey, Ted, door five!
Barney : Were you there? Yeah, I got you, buddy.
UNK: They still haven't had the talk, huh?
Marshall : I think I know how to speed things up.
UNK: Oh, not cool!
Marshall : Pancakes, fresh bacon.
Marshall : It is so yummy.
UNK: Uh, dude, I'm starving. Let's...
Robin : let's just have the stupid talk.
Robin : Come on. Fine.
Robin : But,
UNK: how do these this even work?
Barney : What do we say?
UNK: Huh.
Robin : Where do you see this relationship going?
UNK: Oh, my God, that sounds so cheesy.
Barney : I know, right?
UNK: Totally. But, um,
UNK: where... where do you see this relationship going?
Barney : I don't know.
Robin : I mean,
Barney : it's not like I don't like you.
UNK: I just haven't had a girlfriend for a long time.
UNK: I hope that doesn't make you mad.
Robin : Mad?
Robin : I feel the same way.
Robin : I suck at relationships.
Robin : I mean,
Robin : except with Ted.
UNK: Man, he really got it right.
UNK: I know it's a cliche
Robin : but he really ruined me for other men.
UNK: Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation,
UNK: but I have to imagine Robin said something like that.
UNK: Hmm.
Barney : Maybe we should go back to being just friends.
Robin : Maybe.
UNK: But, um,
UNK: I don't want to stop having sex.
UNK: Oh, good. Me, neither.
UNK: Yeah. Friends isn't gonna work.
UNK: Nope. Oh, we're not good at being friends.
Barney : We're not good at being in a relationship.
Barney : What are we good at?
Robin : I know something we're good at.
Barney : I don't know. If we're gonna do it again,
UNK: I'm gonna need some Gatorade, or...
UNK: No! No, t that.
UNK: Lying. Okay, think about it.
Robin : We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends.
Robin : Why not just keep lying?
Lily : Really? Yeah.
Robin : Really. We sat down. We had the talk.
Robin : Barney's my boyfriend now.
Barney : And Robin's my girlfriend.
Barney : I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.
Robin : We're both afraid of commitment, but, the fact is,
Robin : we also can't live without each other.
Barney : And if the alternative is not being together,
Barney : then it's worth taking this risk 'cause...
Barney : she's awesome.
Robin : And he's awesome.
Robin : He looks nice in a suit.
Barney : She can handle her scotch.
Robin : He's my boyfriend.
Barney : And she's my girlfriend.
UNK: Oh!
Marshall : Good enough!
UNK: We are good. She bought it.
Barney : Hook, line, and sinker.
Barney : We are good.
UNK: Oh, totally. Mm.
Robin : So, you want to get some breakfast?
Barney : You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.
UNK: Hmm. Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.
UNK: Wow! Flugelhorn.
Robin : Yeah, that felt wrong. Mm.
UNK: Ted 2030 : Mm.
Ted : You do realize they were lying, right?
Barney : No, Ted.
Lily : They don't realize they weren't lying.
UNK: And that's the story
UNK: of how Barney and Robin became boyfriend and girlfriend.
UNK: Oh, hello.
Marshall : Hello. Good evening.
Marshall : Hello. Don't get up.
Marshall : Didn't we meet on a yacht?
Marshall : Hello.
Robin : What?
UNK: Oh, no!
Marshall : Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night?
Marshall : Doesn't feel very good, does it?
