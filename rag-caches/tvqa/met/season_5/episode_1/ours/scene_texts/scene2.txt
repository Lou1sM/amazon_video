Ted : They're at home. I...
UNK: Another girl : And where are your pants?
UNK: Oh!
Ted : Oh, God.
Ted : Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...
UNK: Shh, Ted, now's not a good time.
Barney : Where do you keep your condoms?
UNK: Okay, look, mistake #1
Barney : was taking that girl's question.
Barney : You don't take questions on the first day.
Barney : It shows weakness.
UNK: Mistake #2
Barney : was you should've hit that.
Barney : Dude, your pants were already off,
UNK: youu had a classroom full of people to cheer you on,
Barney : and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream.
Barney : Class dismissed.
UNK: Mistake #3 : dude, where was the hat?
UNK: Because if y're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.
Lily : I think what Barney's saying is that
Lily : definitions are important.
Lily : You're their teacher, not their friend.
Barney : Exactly.
Lily : If people don't know their place,
Lily : nobody's happy.
Barney : Amen.
Lily : You have to make things clear.
Barney : Run tell that.
Lily : Define the relationship.
Barney : Yes! No!
Barney : Lily, private convo time.
Barney : Lily, can't you just let us be happy?
Lily : You're not happy.
Lily : You just think you're happy because you feel happy.
Barney : And that's not happy?
Lily : Of course not.
Lily : You and Robin need to have the talk.
Barney : Why? Give me one good reason. I'll give you 20...
UNK: Wow, you can't even think of one.
UNK: Headlights. Deer.
Barney : Lily, for the last time,
Barney : things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be.
Barney : Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.
Brad : I've got two tickets
UNK: to the Rangers/Canucksame tomorrow night.
Brad : I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking...
UNK: Uh, oh, um...
Robin : Uh...
Brad : What do I have to do?
Brad : Put a gun to your head?
Brad : Buy you a six pack?
UNK: Oh, come on, Brad, that's...
Robin : Wow, there's really six of them.
UNK: Uh, but, uh, I can't.
Brad : Why not? You have a boyfriend?
Robin : No. No, no boyfriend.
Brad : Great! It's a date.
Brad : Hey, Barn. Hey, Brad...
UNK: Eventually, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game.
Robin : You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.
UNK: Ted 2030 : Um...
Robin : Damn it, Hordichuk!
Robin : You miss another gimme like that,
Robin : I'm gonna come down there
Robin : and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!
Brad : Not really.
Robin : The truth is,
UNK: I... I feel kind of weird being out with you.
Brad : Oh, man.
Brad : Is this the talk?
Robin : What? No, this is good.
Brad : Let's get it all out of the way.
Brad : Robin, I'm looking for something serious.
Robin : No, Brad, no, it's...
Brad : But before we go any further, you should know something
Brad : about my stuff below the belt.
Brad : I was born a little different.
UNK: God, no, uh,
UNK: Brad, no, um...
Robin : This is about me and Barney. You and Barn...
UNK: Oh, oh, so you, you guys are...
UNK: Well, we... we... we don't know what we are.
Robin : I mean, my heart says "leap into it."
Robin : My brain says "it's a bad idea."
Brad : Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.
UNK: We're not gonna have the talk!
Marshall : Would you just have the talk, okay?
Marshall : It's a five-minute conversation,
UNK: and then you get to have sex afterwards.
Marshall : It's great! Back me up, Ted.
Ted : I don't think the talk is necessary.
Marshall : What?! Thank you, Ted.
