UNK: Ted 2030 : And I did. About 20 times.
Ted : Good morning.
Ted : 'Sup, dudes?
Ted : Silence!
Ted : This is Architecture 101.
Ted : I am Professor Mosby.
Ted : But you can call me Ted.
Ted : Professor Mosby.
Ted : T-Dawg.
Ted : Do not call me T-Dawg.
Barney : Never take questions on the first day.
Barney : It shows weakness.
Barney : Also,
Barney : don't look right here.
Barney : Okay, good luck. Byesies.
UNK: This was it : my crossroads moment.
UNK: What kind of professor was I gonna be
UNK: I had to decide.
Ted : Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture.
Ted : Thank you!
UNK: Ted 2030 : Now...
UNK: Professor Mosby had arrived.
UNK: Of course, if I had taken that girl's question...
UNK: who, by the way,was not your mom
UNK: your mom was sitting...
UNK: Wait, let me finish this story real quick.
UNK: Here's what that girl would have said.
UNK: Blond girl : I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby,
UNK: Blond girl : but this isn't Architecture 101.
UNK: Blond girl : This is Economics 305.
UNK: Blond girl : You're in the wrong classroom.
UNK: Yes, I was in the wrong classroom.
UNK: And thus began
UNK: the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.
Ted : Here's your think-about-it for the day.
Ted : Every single person in this room
Ted : is already an architect.
UNK: A girl : Architect?
UNK: Hmm. Ooh.
UNK: "We're just hanging out."
Lily : Just hanging out?
Lily : Not good enough.
Marshall : Not good enough!
Ted : Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?
UNK: A boy : Economics?
UNK: No. No, no. Don't laugh.
Ted : He's not... he's not entirely wrong.
Ted : An architect must be economical
Ted : in his use of space,
Ted : so, well done.
UNK: Looks like somone's building
UNK: towards an A, huh?
Marshall : "We're seeing where things are going."
UNK: I'll tell you where things aren't going...
Lily : out of that bedroom.
Lily : Not good enough.
Marshall : Not good enough!
UNK: Ted 2030 : You...
Ted : why do you want to be an architect?
Student : I don't want to be an architect.
UNK: Yes. Yes, exactly.
UNK: It... it's not something
Ted : you want to be.
Ted : It's something you need to be.
Ted : You don't have a choice, right?
Ted : None of you has a choice.
Ted : No questions!
Marshall : "We're Barnman and Robin."
UNK: Oh, come on, you got to admit, that's kind of funny, Lily.
Lily : Not good enough.
Marshall : Not good enough!
Ted : So if any of you
Ted : have even the slightest inclination
Ted : to do anything with your life other than become an architect,
Ted : you're wasting my time and yours.
Ted : There's the door.
Lily : You can go.
Ted : I'm serious. Get out. Now.
UNK: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
UNK: Wait, wait, wait. Don't... don't all leave!
Ted : Architecture's fun! Look!
Ted : I brought a hacky sack!
UNK: Other professor : Sorry, I'm late, everyone.
UNK: Other professor : My name is Professor Calzonetti.
UNK: Blond girl : This is Economics 305.
UNK: Other professor : You may return to your seats.
UNK: Uh, sorry, sir.
UNK: This is, uh, Architecture 101.
Ted : Who invited their dad, right?
Professor : Young man,
Professor : for the last 28 years,
Professor : Economics 305 has been taught right here
Professor : in building 14, room 7.
Ted : Uh, yeah.
UNK: Buddy, I'm sure 200 architecture students
Ted : and their professor all got the room wrong.
Student : T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro.
Ted : Sorry. Coming through.
