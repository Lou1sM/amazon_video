Ted : Because Robin is already his girlfriend.
Marshall : What?!
Ted : MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...
Barney : How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend?
Simple : the rules for girls
Barney : are the same as the rules for gremlins.
Ted : "Gremlins"?
UNK: Gremlins. Rule #1 :
Barney : Never get them wet.
UNK: In other words, don't let her take a shower at your place.
UNK: #2 : keep them away from sunlight...
UNK: I.E. don't ever see them during the day.
UNK: And rule #3 never feed them after midnight.
UNK: Meaning she doesn't sleep over
UNK: and you don't have breakfast with her ever.
Ted : What about brunch? Is brunch cool?
Barney : No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.
Ted : Ok, new topic.
Ted : How do I pick a tie?
Simple : remember in the movie Predator...
Barney : I've done all three of those things with Robin.
Barney : Is she my girlfriend?
Marshall : Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.
Voice : Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up
Voice : for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!
UNK: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
UNK: Okay, how about this?
Brad : If you kiss me and you feel bad about it,
Brad : you're meant to be with Barney.
Robin : Why not? Lay it on me.
UNK: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
UNK: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
UNK: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Barney : Hey, Brad.
Barney : Brad, we can't fight like this all night!
Barney : We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!
Brad : It's okay, dude.
Brad : I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, girlfriend?
UNK: He come on.
Robin : That's putting it a bit strongly.
Barney : A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend. Okay, yeah.
Robin : A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?
Lily : Okay, seriously.
Lily : We're at the point of physical violence.
Lily : Now, will you please have the talk?
Barney : Because of that?
UNK: Come on. That's thing.
Barney : I'm always punching guys. Mm-hmm.
Barney : Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.
UNK: Finally, my first class had arrived.
UNK: For real this time.
UNK: I knew I had to make a strong impression.
UNK: I had thought of everything.
UNK: Except...
UNK: Wait. Does professor have one "F" or two?
UNK: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
UNK: Professor.
UNK: Pro-fess-or.
UNK: They're all staring at me.
UNK: Professor. Uh, I don't know.
UNK: Just do something!
UNK: Two "F's." That looks right.
UNK: I think that's right.
Barney : Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.
UNK: Oh, look, we've been over this.
Robin : Unless I say "flugelhorn," you haven't gone too far.
UNK: No, meant punching Brad.
UNK: Oh, right. Look, don't even worry about it.
UNK: It's... oh. God.
Robin : The doorknob's broken off.
Robin : We're locked in here.
Robin : Did, did you do this? No.
Robin : Flugelhorn. Did you do this?
UNK: Ted 2030 : No.
UNK: Ted? Ted, are you out there?
Lily : Ted's not here, Robin.
Robin : Lily, let us out of here.
Lily : I'd be glad to.
Lily : Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.
Robin : Lily! Come on. Let us out!
Lily : No. Sit down,
Lily : define the relationship, write down
Lily : that definition on a piece of paper,
Lily : slip it under the door,
Lily : and if I like what I read, you can go.
Barney : We are not having the talk!
Lily : Then you'll die in there.
Robin : You're gonna lock us in here?
Robin : Well, guess what?
UNK: Maybe we'll spend the whole day having sex!
Robin : Well, guess what?
UNK: I brought Marshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.
Marshall : Hey, guys.
UNK: I still hadn't decided
UNK: what kind of professor I wanted to be...
UNK: authoritative or cool guy.
UNK: I thought I would decide in the moment.
