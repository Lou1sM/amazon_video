Robin : Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this.
Robin : God, I'm buzzing
Robin : On America right now! All right, hold your horses.
Barney : Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie
Barney : and the childhood obesity it leads to--
Barney : who is this?
Robin : That, Barney,
Robin : is the American actor, beloved by millions,
UNK: the "Hey, Vern" guy from the popular series of Ernest films.
Robin : And his name...
Robin : Jeff Foxworthy.
Barney : Jeff Foxworthy?
Barney : No, it's Jim Varney.
Barney : You're kidding me. You don't know that?
Robin : Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass.
Robin : End of story. Now shut your stupid face.
Barney : Not only are you wrong,
Barney : but you are belligerently sticking to your guns
Barney : and insulting me in the process.
Barney : Robin Scherbatsky--
Barney : you are an American.
Woman : Look who's back from the wishing well.
Ted : It didn't work, I'm still here.
Ted : Marshall, what are we doing?
Ted : We should be on the road.
Marshall : Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay?
Marshall : We don't have to drive all night.
Lily : Besides, they have a spa.
Woman : All our spa treatments are designed for couples.
Woman : Would you be interested
UNK: in the two-person, cornmeal body scrub?
UNK: And then finally it happened.
UNK: Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob.
Lily : We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!
Ted : Whoa.
Ted : I got to dial back on the Tantrum.
UNK: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all.
UNK: Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't.
UNK: My choice.
Robin : Learn English!
UNK: The Hoser Hut.
UNK: I could duck in for a drink.
UNK: No, no, that life's behind me.
UNK: Forget it.
UNK: Well, I could in for just one beer.
UNK: What's the harm in that?
UNK: It's a free country.
UNK: * O Canada
UNK: * Our home and native land...
Robin : Oh, God, I miss it.
UNK: * True patriots love...
Ted : Hey, man.
Marshall : Shh.
Ted : Sorry about what I said before.
Ted : You want to go to the store and get some beer?
Marshall : Lily is asleep.
Woman : I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure.
Marshall : What the hell? But only light beer
Marshall : because we have a couple hike in the morning.
Marshall : Dude, why are we pulling to the highway?
Marshall : Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?
Ted : Chicago.
Marshall : What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily.
Marshall : When she wakes up, she's going to freak!
Ted : She'll have a back rub and a crumpet.
Ted : She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.
Marshall : I just abandoned my wife.
Marshall : How am I supposed to have fun?
UNK: * And I would walk 500 miles
UNK: * And I would walk 500 more...
Ted : Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?
Marshall : If she's pissed, she's pissed.
Ted : Pfft.
UNK: When Barney finally
UNK: tracked down your Aunt Robin,
UNK: it wasn't a pretty sight.
Barney : Good morning.
Robin : Barney?
Ted : Oh, my God. What happened last night?
Barney : You went Canadian.
Robin : How Canadian?
Barney : This Canadian.
Barney : Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view
Barney : of the Toronto sky-- you're in Toronto.
Robin : Oh, God.
Robin : Okay. It's coming back to me.
Robin : I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut..
Robin : And I met this women's curling team
UNK: We started drinking.
UNK: And the next thing I know, they're inviting me
UNK: to a Bryan Adams/Rich tittle double bill in Toronto.
Robin : How did you find me, anyway?
Barney : You called me, said you were never coming back.
Barney : So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...
