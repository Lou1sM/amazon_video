Ted : Let's go in and see what they remember.
Ted : And they are my best friends,
Ted : so don't be surprised if they suddenly "can't think"of
Ted : anything I do wrong.
Robin : Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm.
Robin : Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check
Lily : Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine.
Lily : Keep pannin' that river, buddy.
Marshall : Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a coom.
Lily : Oh!
Jen : Actually you know what it was?
Jen : I remember him coming across as kind of a player.
Barney : Me? Ted? Ted?
Robin : Yeah.
Jen : We were all sitting over there...
Jen : And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains.
Jen : You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...
UNK: Wh about Cat Woman?
Jen : Yeah, that would've been good.
Barney : Psst! Ted!
Jen : Nice.
Ted : Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I member that.
UNK: Psst, Ted.
Jen : Nice.
Ted : We were checking out Moustache Marshall.
Robin : Ah. Ah.
Jen : Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk.
Jen : I'm so sorry.
Ted : Yeah, well, it's nice to know
Ted : "past me" wasn't a total jackass, huh?
Jen : "Present you" isn't so bad, either.
Jen : Thank you very much. You got it.
Jen : Yes.
Jen : Oh, yeah!
Jen : I remember this.
UNK: ...and there's the Chrysler Building.
UNK: And the Empire State Building.
UNK: And at 12 : 00, a rotund couple
UNK: going at it against the glass.
Jen : Aww...
Jen : That's kind of sweet.
Jen : Oh, look.
Jen : Snack break.
Ted : Good for them.
Ted : Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love.
Ted : So, um...
Ted : I know this wasn't the best first date of all time,
UNK: but, uh, I'm glad we stuck it out.
Jen : Me, too.
Ted : That was really great.
Ted : Wh... What went wrong?
Jen : I remember now.
Jen : Wow.
Robin : Yeah.
Ted : So would you maybe, um...
Ted : want to go out again?
Jen : Yeah, I, I would.
Jen : Will you call me?
Ted : Absolutely.
Jen : Promise?
Jen : Promise.
Ted : I have been so busy.
Jen : Good night, Ted.
Jen : Hello?
Ted : Jen, I sorry.
Ted : Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call,
Ted : but I was an idiot back then.
Ted : You saw the goatee.
Ted : The truth is,
Ted : I had a great time tonight,
Ted : and I'd love to see you again.
Jen : Ted, there are two kinds of guys.
Jen : The guys that you want to call you, who don't;
Jen : and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do.
Jen : And somehow, right now, you're both.
Lily : Baby...
Lily : You should be able to fantasize about another woman
Lily : without feeling guilty,
Marhsall : I wish that I could,
Marhsall : but I've been doing this for so long,
Marhsall : I'm all confused about death and sex.
Marhsall : It's gotten to the pot where
Marhsall : every time I drive past a cemetery,
Marhsall : I'm sportin' a partial.
Ted : All right, we got to fix this.
Lily : Okay, when
Lily : Stripper Lily gets out here,
Lily : you have my permission to fantasize about her.
Lily : And since she's basically me,
Lily : maybe you won't feel guilty.
Marshall : Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you.
Marshall : And stripper you.
Lily : Bring out Stripper Lily!
