Ted : Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?
Robin : Brutal. Really? How?
Barney : It was like we were on a date
Barney : With a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.
Robin : And they were so nervous,
Robin : That they weren't even making sense half of the time.
UNK: Ted 2030 : Hey. Come on in.
Lily : Would you like a margarita?
Marshall : In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle! Come on in.
Barney : And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.
UNK: Did Marshall get, like,
UNK: Super intense about the cheese?
Robin : Yeah, how'd you know?
Ted : Poor Marshall.
Ted : Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she lets Marshall
UNK: Is pick out one sad block of cheese.
Lily : That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.
Marshall : You guys are going to want to get in on this gouda.
Lily : That's seared scallops with a mango chutney.
Marshall : Seriously, don't sleep on the gouda.
Lily : And that's
Lily : Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil.
Marshall : Ooh... Tick-tock goes the gouda clock.
Barney : Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner.
Barney : We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.
Robin : P.S., not sitting great.
Barney : And if anything didn't go according to plan,
Barney : They would freak out.
Lily : What do you mean, the egg timer is broken?
Lily : What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?
Marshall : I'm working on it, darling.
Marshall : Okay? Just stall them.
UNK: Now, Robin...
UNK: You work in television.
UNK: We're experiencing some technical difficulties.
UNK: You get that?
UNK: We're still laughing.
UNK: Right? Laugh, Marshall.
Ted : Come on, they just got excited.
Ted : They've been looking for couple best friends forever.
UNK: Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.
Robin : Show him.
Barney : This is a web site
Barney : Marshall already made about last night.
Barney : It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.
UNK: * It was the best night ever *
UNK: * laughter raining down like April showers *
UNK: * oh, we talked for hours... *
UNK: * best night ever * oh, that's not good.
UNK: * Then we played charades *

UNK: Marshall always singing in the video : That's the 17th. * Are you free? *
UNK: Marshall always singing in the video : Friday or Sunday would also work.
UNK: Marshall always singing in the video : Or basically any other day.
Barney : Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.
Ted : I don't understand.
Ted : If last night went so horribly,
Ted : Why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?
Barney : I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight,
Barney : But we had no idea how much.
Lily : Oh. Yeah, tough luck,
Robin : Every Saturday night I've ever had,
Robin : 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.
Barney : Let's do it again, soon. Yeah, we'll call you.
