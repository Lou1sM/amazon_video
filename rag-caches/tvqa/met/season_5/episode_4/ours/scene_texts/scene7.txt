UNK: * but when we dial the telephone *
UNK: * nobody's home *
Robin : Hi. Two for dinner.
Woman : Just the two of you?
UNK: * All by ourselves *
UNK: * don't want to be *
UNK: * all by ourselves anymore *
UNK: * all by ourselves... *
Barney : Hey, why don't we call
Barney : That weird couple down the hall from you?
Barney : You know, with the ferrets?
Barney : Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.
Robin : After midnight? No way.
Robin : We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.
Lily : Hey, guys.
Lily : Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?
Barney : Maybe. But they're Armani.
Ted : Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you.
Ted : So I'm just going to come out and say it.
Ted : You're a couple.
Ted : And no matter how hard you try to fight it,
Ted : Couples need other couples.
Ted : That's why you miss Marshall and Lily.
Ted : And can't you just admit that?
Marshall : Oh, yeah!
Girl : That was amazing, Lily!
Marshall : I know!
Lily : When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, "what?!"
Guy : You guys are the best.
Marshall : Oh, right back at you!
Marshall : Ding.
Lily : For charades.
Lily : How do we know you two won't hurt us again?
Robin : You don't.
Marshall : You know what?
Marshall : We have two very nice people up in that apartment
Marshall : Who are perfect for us.
Barney : Then what are you doing,
Barney : Standing out in the rain with us?
Lily : Damn it.
Lily : Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy...
Lily : And girl?
Marshall : I think we can change them.
Lily : Come here, you two.
Barney : We'll never sleep on the gouda again.
UNK: * All by ourselves... *
Ted : Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you.
Ted : You want to hear it? No, not really.
Ted : 'Twas the night before, I had hours to kill.
UNK: I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.
Barney : With quill?
Ted : Barney. It's a poem.
UNK: A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin.
UNK: Her garb said "classy," but her eyes whispered "sin."
UNK: She said, "you're a teacher?"
UNK: I said, "yes, indeed."
UNK: "I must have you," she moaned.
UNK: "I'm turned on by tweed."
UNK: With haste we did scamper
UNK: To my chamber anon.
UNK: We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on.
UNK: I unlaced her bodice.
UNK: Our passions grew deeper.
UNK: And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.
Ted : No way.
Barney : You made that up.
Girl : Are you coming back bed, professor?
Barney : Whew!
Ted : God, I love being single.
Robin : Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?
Marshall : What have I done?
