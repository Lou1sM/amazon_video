Barney : But I only have one rule.
Barney : You can't change anything.
Lily : Why would I change anything?
Lily : This place is...
Lily : Perfect.
Lily : Except for the fact that you don't have a tv.
Barney : See that wall?
Barney : 300-inch flat-screen.
Barney : They only sell them in japan, but I know a guy.
Barney : Had to ship it over in a tugboat
Barney : Like freakin' king kong.
Lily : It hurts my eyes.
Barney : Yeah. That doesn't go away.
Lily : Hey.
Ted : Hey, where have you been?
UNK: Marshall arriving : The alanis morissette concert.
UNK: By yourself? No, actually I went
Marshall : With a friend from law school.
UNK: Oh, really?
Robin : Who's this friend?
Marshall : Brad.
Brad : Bro, alanis morissette rocks!
Marshall : Totally! I can't believe
Marshall : I almost didn't come tonight. Let me guess :
UNK: You bought the tickets for you and lily
UNK: Right before she dumped you.
Marshall : Yeah, how'd you know?
Brad : I just got dumped myself.
UNK: What, kara broke up with you?
UNK: I'm sorry, man. That sucks.
UNK: Brad, do you like brunch?
Ted : You invited him to brunch?
Marshall : Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why, is that weird?
Ted : Yes. That's why I was all,
Ted : "you invited him to brunch?"
Marshall : Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?
Ted : Because brunch is kind of...
Robin : Girly.
Marshall : Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.
Marshall : Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?
Ted : I don't know.
Ted : There's nothing girly about a horse.
Ted : Nothing girly about a horn,
Ted : But put them together and you get a unicorn.
Marshall : I don't care what either of you say,
Lily : I am going to the popover pantry with brad.
Marshall : We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.
Barney : Hmm...
UNK: Smells delicious. Thank you.
Lily : There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...
Lily : What are you doing?
Barney : Lily, what was the first rule again?
UNK: Don't change anything?
Barney : And what was the second rule?
Lily : There was no second rule.
Barney : Exactly! There was only one rule
Barney : And you broke it.
Lily : I bought groceries.
Lily : That counts as changing something?
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Lily,
UNK: If I wanted a fridge full of groceries,
UNK: Or fresh coffee in the morning,
UNK: I'd be in a relationship.
UNK: But I don't want to be in a relationship.
UNK: That's why I make it crystal-clear
UNK: To every girl that walks through that door
UNK: That this is not a place to leave a toothbrush.
UNK: This is not a place to leave a contact lens case.
UNK: This is a place to leave.
UNK: Come on, I'll give you a tour.
UNK: Uh, no flash photography, please.
UNK: Bienvenido to the bedroom.
UNK: Dig this : King-sized bed,
UNK: Full-sized blanket, one pillow.
UNK: Everything about this bed says,
UNK: "our work here is done."
UNK: Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom.
UNK: What, only one towel?
UNK: What, no hairdryer?
UNK: You know where I keep that stuff?
UNK: Your place. Beat it.
UNK: And the coup de grace...
UNK: Yeah, that's right.
UNK: Patent-pending.
UNK: And wilkommen to the hallway.
Barney : While guys like ted and marshall may hide their porn...
UNK: Marshall doesn't have porn.
Barney : Aww, that's sweet.
Barney : While guys like ted and marshall may hide their porn,
Barney : I had mine...
Barney : Professionally lit.
Barney : Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.
Lily : And if that doesn't drive them away,
Lily : There's always your life-sized storm-trooper.
UNK: No, that's just awesome.
Barney : So you see,
Barney : Whenever a girl wakes up here,
Barney : I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else.
Barney : My apartment does it for me.
Marshall : God, I love brunch.
Brad : Oh, damn...
Brad : The zucchini bread is "ridonkulous."
Marshall : This isn't weird, right?
Brad : I sort of thought it might be,
Brad : But it totally isn't.
UNK: And b-t-dub, you totally
Brad : Did not oversell the eggs benny.
UNK: Right? I mean,
Brad : Why can't two single bros
Brad : Go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?
Marshall : Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.
Brad : This must be destiny.
Marshall : What are you talking about?
Brad : I have two tickets for mamma mia Friday night.
Brad : You like abba, right?
UNK: : What am I saying? Who doesn't?
Brad : Anyway, I was gonna take kara, but now it's all you and me.
Brad : We're gonna do broadway, bro style. What do you say?
Marshall : Yeah!
