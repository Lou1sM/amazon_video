UNK: That is so cool. Mm.
UNK: Future Ted VO : Some aren't as nice.
Robin : And then there was derek, and counting you,
Robin : That puts the total up to... Oh, I got your total.

Ted : You're scared of the seven dwarfs?
Robin : Just doc. He's creepy.
Robin : I mean the guy went to medical school.
Robin : What's he doing living with six coal miners?
Barney : I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.
UNK: Why? Uh...
Barney : Only the gala event
Barney : For the grand opening of sharper image's 500th store.
Barney : Didn't you get my e-mail?
Robin : No, I blocked your address
Robin : After the fourth time you sent me the video
Robin : Of the monkey sniffing his own butt.
UNK: Come on! It's on me.
Barney : I'm buying three of you foot massagers
Barney : And one of you a nose hair trimmer.
Barney : You know who you are.
Barney : Come on,
UNK: Let's go!
UNK: Okay, I'm in.
Barney : To the willowbrook mall!
Guys : To the willowbrook mall. Oh, it's
Robin : At a mall?
Robin : I'm not going.
Ted : What? Why not?
Robin : I just don't feel like
Robin : Going to a mall.
UNK: We can split a cinnabon.
UNK: No, I'm really not going to go.
Ted : Come on, it'll be fun.
Robin : No, I don't go to malls!
Robin : Sorry, I just don't like malls.
Ted : Why not?
Robin : I'd rather not say.
UNK: Sharper images. But that's where clothes live.
Ted : Guys, guys, guys, robin doesn't like malls.
Ted : If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to.
Ted : I think we should all
Ted : Just respect her privacy.
Robin : Thanks, ted.
Ted : So, what's the deal with you and malls?
UNK: I thought you said that, if I didn't
Robin : Want to talk about it, I didn't have to.
Ted : Yeah, with those people.
UNK: But I'm your boyfriend. Come on. What is it?
UNK: Did you get arrested at a mall?
UNK: Future Ted VO : No.
UNK: Dumped at a mall? Ted.
Ted : Found out you were canadian at a mall?
UNK: Let it go. Trapped under a fake boulder
UNK: At a mall? Let it go.
Ted : Mauled at the mall?
UNK: Let it go!
UNK: And who gets trapped
UNK: Under a fake boulder at the mall?
UNK: Not me in ohio when I was nine,
UNK: That's for sure.
Ted : Why won't robin tell me why she hates malls?
Barney : Ted, you should be happy robin has a secret.
Barney : The more you learn about a person,
Barney : The better chance you have of hitting
UNK: The fatal "oh" moment.
Barney : Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail
Barney : About a person that is going to be a deal breaker.
UNK: Girl #1 : It's a promise ring.
UNK: Girl #1 : I made a pact with god to stay a virgin till I'm married.
Ted : Oh.
UNK: Girl #2 : I don't have an eating disorder.
UNK: Girl #2 : It's just when I put food in my mouth,
UNK: Girl #2 : I chew it, and then I spit it out.
Ted : Oh.
UNK: I just turned 30. Oh.
Barney : So trust me,
Barney : You want to postpone knowing anything about each other
Barney : For as long as possible. Mm. I disagree.
UNK: If there is some potential "oh" moment,
Ted : I want to know about it right away.
Ted : I mean, what's the alternative?
Priest : I now pronounce you, man and wife.
Ted : I love you.
Robin : I used to be a dude.
Lily : Yeah, I agree with ted.
Lily : In a real relationship, you share everything.
Lily : That's why marshall and I don't keep any secrets.
Barney : You are such a cutie pie.
Barney : Here's a quarter. Go play a song on the jukebox.
Ted : They tell each other everything.
Barney : I can think of tons of things,
Barney : There's no way marshall's told you.
Lily : Try me.
Barney : Do you know about the time marshall was in trenton?
UNK: Donkey ate his pants. Yup.
Barney : Bill's bachelor party in memphis?
Lily : Oh, when they had to pump out
Lily : All the nickels from his stomach?
UNK: Wow. Okay. Seattle.
Lily : Trick question.
Lily : Marshall's never been to the pacific northwest
Lily : Because he's afraid of sasquatch.
Barney : Damn.
Marshall : I'm not afraid of sasquatch,
Marshall : I just think we should all be on alert.
Ted : Not only do they tell each other everything,
Ted : They want to know everything.
Marshall : So after the shower I was brushing my teeth.
UNK: And I was like, "oh, man!"
Marshall : I wanted to have some orange juice.
UNK: "I should have done that first."
Marshall : But I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush.
Marshall : So I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.
Lily : What happened next?
UNK: back to present scene Ted : Yeah, meanwhile, robin tells me nothing.
Barney : Fine.
Barney : Do you want to know what robin's secret is?
Ted : You know?
Barney : Of course I know.
Barney : Her face got flushed... That's shame, my friend.
Barney : Our friend robin used to do porn, wait for it...
Barney : Ography.
Ted : Yeah, we didn't really need to wait for that.
Ted : And it's ridiculous.
Lily : I don't know. He could be right.
Lily : She does have the fake orgasm noises down.
Marshall : Hey!
Lily : What? The walls are thin.
Ted : That's not what I'm "hey" ing you about.
UNK: You know what it might be?
UNK: This is going to sound
Marshall : A little crazy but what if robin is married?
Marshall : Married?
UNK: What does that have to do with the mall?
Marshall : Well, maybe she got married at the mall.
UNK: A ton of people get married at the mall of america.
