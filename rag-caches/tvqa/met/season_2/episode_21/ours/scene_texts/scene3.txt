Barney : Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.
Scooter : Maybe my words won't change your mind,
Scooter : But maybe the words of a poet will.
Scooter : I read from "November rain."
Scooter : By w. Axl rose.
Robin : That is a good song.
Brad : Barney said you needed me to bounce
Brad : Some guy named scooter?
Brad : What's up with bill?
Lily : That's scooter.
Brad : I'm on it.
UNK: Hey. Hey.
Barney : Can I have your phone number?
Lily : No.
Barney : It's for the bride.
Woman : Oh. Hold on.
Woman : Let me go get a pen.
Barney : The bride wants you to walk slower.
Andrea : Oh...
Robin : Oh, wow.
Lily : Oh. Robin...
Lily : My makeup looks perfect right now,
Lily : And I'm about to cry. Do something.
UNK: Oh. Um...
UNK: Uh. I have hairy nipples.
Robin : Really?
Robin : No, but it worked, didn't it?
Brad : Hey. Funny story.
Brad : I tackled this guy I thought was scooter.
Brad : Turns out it was your photographer.
Brad : Don't worry.
Brad : I got this sweet camera phone,
Brad : So we're covered.
UNK: There's no photographer?
Robin : Okay, I just have to call... Robin, stop. Stop.
Lily : It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.
Woman : I just got a call from the florist.
Woman : The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.
Lily : I'm okay.
Man : I hate to bother you, but...
Man : I think I found your veil in the parking lot.
Lily : I'm fine.
UNK: Just fyi : My water broke.
UNK: But I can probably...
UNK: Make it through.
Lily : Totally cool.
Robin : Oh, no.
Robin : Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties.
Robin : I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.
Lily : Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.
Robin : Are you sure?
Lily : I'm marrying marshall today.
Lily : So it doesn't even matter
Lily : That I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil
Lily : In a room that has no flowers
Lily : To the music of half a harp
Lily : Played by a woman who's crowning,
Lily : As my high school boyfriend
Lily : Reads guns n' roses lyrics.
Lily : But that's okay,
Lily : Because there's no photographer there
Lily : To take any pictures of it anyway.
Robin : Lily, are you okay?
Lily : What do you think?!
Lily : Of course I'm not okay!
Lily : Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has!
UNK: Well... It's ruined!
Robin : What happened to "I don't want a perfect wedding"?
Lily : Oh, grow up, robin!
Lily : Of course I want a perfect wedding!
Lily : Oh, god.
Lily : I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but...
Barney : I do.
Lily : I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.
Robin : And you will.
Robin : It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
Robin : I have something that'll make you feel better.
Lily : What could you have
Lily : That could possibly make me feel better?
Lily : God, I hope marshall's having a better day
Lily : Than I'm having.
Robin : Oh, my god.
Marshall : Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
