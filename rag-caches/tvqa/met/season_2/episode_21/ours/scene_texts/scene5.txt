Marshall : So, um, just not-not too short, okay?
UNK: Mm-hmm. Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all.
Cousin : Could just give it some style.
Marshall : Oh, okay, yeah, that's great.
Marshall : 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird.
Marshall : And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.
Cousin : Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.

UNK: But yeah, great, lay them on me.
Marshall : I can't get married like this!
Marshall : There's no way!
