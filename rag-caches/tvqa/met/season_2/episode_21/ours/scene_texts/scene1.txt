Lily : Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.
Barney : Sweet! I can cross off two things.
Ted : So the day arrived for lily and marshall's
UNK: Ted 2030 : Very big indoor wedding... With a harp.
Andrea : Hi, lily.
Lily : Wow. Andrea.
Lily : You really are pregnant.
UNK: Yeah. Um...
Robin : How do you play the harp with your belly so...?
Andrea : Oh, I don't really... I can only reach about half the strings.
Robin : You only play half the harp?
Lily : Yeah.
Robin : Oh, no. Uh, okay.
Robin : Lily, I will take care of this.
Robin : Um, I'll just pluck the other half.
Robin : Is it hard to learn?
Andrea : I've been studying the harp for 12 years.
Robin : Yeah, but I'm a fast learner.
Robin : You ever hear of "guitar hero"? Learned that in a day.
Robin : Is there a "harp hero"?
Lily : Robin, it's fine.
Lily : So, so, when are you due?
Andrea : Tuesday.
Lily : Wow, that's soon.
Andrea : Last Tuesday.
Robin : Holy crap, we have to fire her.
Robin : She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.
Lily : Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out.
Lily : I hate those women who say, "oh, my wedding has to be perfect."
Lily : Things go wrong.
Lily : Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist.
Lily : Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.
UNK: Hey, can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?
UNK: Nope; I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.
Barney : Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.
Barman : I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.
Barney : You allowed to accept criticism?
Barney : You, sir, are an ass... Buddy.
Barney : Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player?
Barney : "Hey, baby, want to pluck?"
Robin : Really? That didn't work.
Barney : Not even a little.
UNK: Huh. Hey!
Barney : Who's bill?
Barney : Bill?
Barney : Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.
Bill : Can I ask you something?
Bill : Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask
Bill : If anyone objects?
Barney : Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.
Bill : Oh, so when do you think someone should do it?
Bill : Just wait for a lull or what?
Robin : Oh, no.
Lily : Did he look like a guy who tried
Lily : To be an umpire but failed?
Barney : He kind of did.
Lily : That's scooter.
Robin : Your high school boyfriend, scooter?
Lily : His real name is bill.
Lily : My mom must have invited him.
Robin : Why? Why would she do that?
Lily : Our families are really close.
Lily : But my ex-boyfriend?
Lily : Come on, mom.
Lily : I didn't invite that professional squash player
Lily : Dad busted you with.
Lily : Oh, I need a glass
UNK: Of wine. I'll get it.
Lily : Oh, thanks.
Lily : Hey, how's marshall doing?
Barney : He's great.
Barney : He's about to get his hair cut.
Lily : Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.
Barney : Me, too. I was up all night.
Scooter : Hello, lily.
Barney : Hey, bill.
Scooter : Hey, barney.
Lily : Scooter, what are you doing here?
Scooter : It's not "scooter" anymore.
Scooter : It's bill.
Scooter : A lot of things have changed about me, lily,
Scooter : But one hasn't.
Scooter : I still love you.
Scooter : And I came here to win you back.
Lily : You're really cute.
Lily : Oh, no. Really?
UNK: Lily, I-I know it's crazy, but I love you, and if you
