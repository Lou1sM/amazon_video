Robin : Anyone's supposed to see you.
Lily : What happened? Did amy do this to you?
Marshall : Just the frosted tips. I did the rest.
Marshall : I'm sorry, baby.
Marshall : I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?

Marshall : How are people going to know whose butt that is?
Lily : What happened?
Lily : Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?

Marshall : What do you think, baby?
