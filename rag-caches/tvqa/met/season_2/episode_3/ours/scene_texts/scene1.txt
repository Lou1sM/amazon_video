UNK: Ted's mother : Coffee?
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Now, grandma and grandpa didn't like to talk
UNK: Ted from 2030 : About things that were uncomfortable, emotional,
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Or in any way... Real.
Lily : Hi, mr. And mrs. Mosby.
UNK: Ted's father : Oh, lily! Hi, marshall.

UNK: Ted's mother : Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your...
UNK: Ted's mother : You know, the, the...
UNK: Ted's mother : Well...
Marshall : Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?
Lily : Me begging marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?
UNK: Ted's mother : I love your hair.
Ted : This was only the second time marshall and lily
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Had seen each other since breaking up,
UNK: Ted from 2030 : But to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.
Marshall : Actually, we're cool.
Marshall : We just divided up cds.
Marshall : It was all very civil.
UNK: I'm proud of us; we're, we're good.
UNK: Mrs. Mosby : Well, we were all
UNK: Going to go to casa a pezzi at 8 : 00.
UNK: Lily, would you like to join us?
Marshall : Um...
Marshall : What?
Lily : Well, I-I don't want to go
Lily : If it would make you uncomfortable.
Marshall : Why would it?
Lily : Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good,
Lily : But you got to admit there's that stuff between us.
Marshall : Um, not for me.
Marshall : Now it's just like we're friends.
Marshall : It's like we're brother and sister.
Lily : "Brother and sister"?!
Robin : Okay.
Lily : Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro.
UNK: Ted from 2030 : See? Not awkward at all.
Lily : Hello, everyone. Hi. Hi.
Lily : Hello, marshall.
UNK: Mrs. Mosby : Lily, that is
UNK: Ted's mother : A stunning dress.
Lily : Oh, thanks.
Lily : It's kind of revealing,
Lily : But I thought, "hey, we're all family."
Lily : Right, bro?
UNK: Ooh. Ow.
Ted : What's wrong?
Lily : Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today.
Lily : The instructor told me to just take deep breaths
Lily : To get through the pain, just...
Lily : Are you all right?
Lily : You're kind of sweating.
Marshall : No, I'm fine.
Marshall : It's just... This roll is really spicy.
Marshall : She just wore that dress to torture me.
Marshall : Well, you know what? Two can play at that game.
Marshall : See, at brunch, I'm going to torture lily right back.
Lily : Yeah.
Marshall : There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.
Barney : Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.
Marshall : No, not that.
Marshall : I'm going to unleash my calves.
Barney : That's crazy.
Barney : Nobody's turned on by men's calves.
Barney : They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.
Marshall : Well, yeah, I'd say that, too,
Marshall : If I had those skinny little chicken legs.
Barney : I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.
UNK: Ted from 2030 : So marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.
UNK: Hello. Oh, hi.
UNK: Hey, marshall. Hey.
Lily : Hey. How are you feeling?
Lily : You looked kind of feverish last night.
Marshall : Oh, no, I actually feel great.
Marshall : It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?
Lily : Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of...
Lily : What are you doing?
Marshall : Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
