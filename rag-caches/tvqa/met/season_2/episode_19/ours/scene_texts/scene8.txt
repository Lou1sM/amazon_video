UNK: I can't believe you carved that crucifix yourself.
UNK: So talented.
UNK: Didn't think you could carve.
UNK: For you.
UNK: Oh. And this one's from...
UNK: Grandma lois.
UNK: Grandma lois : Oh. No, wait, darling.
UNK: Before you open this, I-I want to say a few words.
Ted : Okay, something you need to know.
UNK: Grandma lois thought she was giving her granddaughter
UNK: An antique sewing machine.
UNK: And we're back in.
UNK: Honey,
UNK: This handy little device has been
UNK: In our family for generations.
UNK: I used it. Your great grandmother used it.
UNK: Now,
UNK: Her mother didn't use this one,
UNK: But she used one just like it.
UNK: Of course, back then, they were made out of wood.
UNK: And, uh, I guess before that,
UNK: You just had to do it by hand.
UNK: Would you pass the wine, please?
UNK: No.
UNK: Hey, marshall,
UNK: While we're here, you may as well go down
UNK: To the morgue and climb into a drawer,
UNK: 'cause that's what marriage is like.
UNK: Can I get an amen?
UNK: Is everything all right at home, stuart?
UNK: No.
UNK: It's broken.
UNK: Oh, damn it. This is bad.
UNK: I really can't lose this job.
UNK: My daughters are about to start school,
UNK: And my fiancÃ©, well...
UNK: Ever since he got back from iraq,
UNK: Pretty much all he does is drink.
UNK: I think about leaving him,
UNK: But I don't want my girls growing up without a dad
UNK: Like I did.
UNK: I don't want them to know what that's like.
UNK: So, show time?
UNK: What is the matter with you?
UNK: Her ankle's broken.
UNK: I know for a fact
UNK: That the second half of her act takes place largely
UNK: In a seated or supine position.
UNK: Oh, that's true.
UNK: Treasure, please, don't worry about the show.
UNK: Uh, we'd feel bad.
UNK: What does that mean?
UNK: No. We just mean, uh, you're off the hook.
UNK: You don't have to do it.
UNK: I don't have to do it? Well, guess what?
UNK: I know I don't have to do it.
UNK: I do it because I am good at it.
UNK: Look, I don't need your pity.
UNK: All I want to do is give you a great show
UNK: Because you're getting married!
UNK: Is that so much to ask?
UNK: Is that such a major inconvenience?!
UNK: Oh. Wow.
UNK: Oh, that is wrong.
UNK: Oh, that's just so wrong.
UNK: Well, the doctor did say for her to keep it elevated.
UNK: When I was a girl,
UNK: My mother taught me and my sister to use it.
UNK: We used to have contests to see who could finish faster.
UNK: It was so exciting.
UNK: The whole family would gather around to watch.
UNK: And when I was a new bride,
UNK: This is what kept me busy all those long nights
UNK: When your grandfather was in korea.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Grandma lois : And speaking
UNK: Of your grandpa,
UNK: Though I don't think he'd care to admit this
UNK: To any of his army buddies, but
UNK: He'd have a go at it every once in a while.
UNK: And he enjoyed it.
UNK: Oh,
UNK: Open it up, sweetie.
UNK: May this give for you as much joy as it's brought me.
UNK: Oh, thank you.
UNK: Grandma, um...
UNK: Wow.
UNK: Well, take it out, honey.
UNK: I want to show you how to use it.
Robin : Okay, no, no!
UNK: Don't take it out.
UNK: Lily, that's not your grandma's gift.
UNK: It's mine.
UNK: I panicked, and I switched
UNK: The cards because I was embarrassed.
UNK: Well, what is it?
UNK: It's just like the one miranda gave to charlotte
UNK: On sex and the city.
UNK: Oh, I love that show.
UNK: I always watch it on tbs.
Janice : Oh, you would.
UNK: You're such a samantha!
UNK: Oh, I'm a carrie! You're a samantha!
Ted : And then the night became
UNK: A whole new kind of uncomfortable.
UNK: So where do I get one of these?
UNK: Mom!
