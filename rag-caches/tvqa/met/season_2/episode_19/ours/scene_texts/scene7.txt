UNK: Which exit's the hospital?
UNK: What if she doesn't make it to the hospital?
UNK: Barney, please calm down.
UNK: Maybe we should just take her to the desert,
UNK: Bury her and wash our hands of this whole thing!
UNK: Dude, what is the matter with you?
UNK: I'm just trying to illustrate to marshall that as his best man...
UNK: You're not my best man. As his best man,
UNK: I would help him bury a hooker in the desert.
UNK: I'm not a hooker.
UNK: And you're not my best man.
UNK: You've ruined my bachelor party.
UNK: I don't know why you wouldn't just listen to me
UNK: When I said I didn't want this.
UNK: Well, the fight started ten minutes ago.
UNK: Maybe-maybe we should listen.
UNK: Radio announcer : Oh, doctor, what a fight!
UNK: That knockout will be talked about for years to come!
