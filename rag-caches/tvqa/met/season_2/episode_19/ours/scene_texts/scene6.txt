UNK: Of course there's no way I'm going to tell you about her show.
UNK: So, let's skip ahead a little.
UNK: Ow!
UNK: Oh, my god, are you all right?
UNK: No, I am not all right, you idiot.
UNK: My ankle is broken!
UNK: Take me to the hospital!
UNK: Um, actually, we have tickets.
UNK: You know what?
UNK: Thanks a lot, barney.
UNK: She told you at the beginning of the show
UNK: Not to use the smoke machine when she's on the hippity hop.
UNK: Now I'm going to have to spend the rest
UNK: Of my bachelor party in a hospital.
UNK: Well, hey, maybe we'll get to see her x-rays.
UNK: The ultimate strip show.
UNK: X-rays. More like triple x-rays.
UNK: Just stop.
