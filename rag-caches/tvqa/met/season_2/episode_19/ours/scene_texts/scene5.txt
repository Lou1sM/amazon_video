Marshall : This is going to be great!
UNK: Meat, violence,
UNK: Throwing money down the toilet.
America : 1; every other country : 0.
UNK: Thanks, guys.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: You okay, barney?
UNK: What can I say, ted?
UNK: You won.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: You one...
UNK: Sad, pathetic loser.
UNK: Boys, say hello to treasure.
Boys : Hi, treasure.
UNK: I can't believe that you did this.
UNK: I had to. I'm your best man.
UNK: Ted's my best man.
UNK: You've yet to make a decision and that's fine.
UNK: But as your best-man-to-be,
UNK: It's my job to make sure at your bachelor party
UNK: You see a woman take her clothes off
UNK: While dancing to whitesnake's "here I go again."
UNK: All right, fine, but...
UNK: Let's make it fast, all right.
UNK: The fight starts in an hour. We don't want to miss it.
UNK: It's a girl taking her clothes off.
UNK: How long can it take?
UNK: It's a bit more complicated than that.
UNK: I need two grounded sockets,
UNK: A large sterile pot filled with hot water
UNK: And you all need to sign these releases.
UNK: An egg beater!
UNK: Aw, thank you, aunt sylvia!
UNK: I love that it's cordless.
UNK: Well, at least I got that part right.
UNK: All of these gifts are so thoughtful.
Robin : Lily?
UNK: I need you to look at me right now and read my mind.
UNK: Oh, my god! You're hearing me!
Lily : Yeah!
UNK: Sorry this party's so boring.
UNK: What's up?
UNK: Do not open my gift.
UNK: See what I'm doing here?
UNK: I'm looking over at the gift,
UNK: Then back at you,
UNK: And I'm shaking my head, "no."
UNK: Gift.
UNK: You.
UNK: No.
UNK: Are you getting that?
UNK: I totally got it.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Hmm?
UNK: Oh!
UNK: Here you go.
UNK: Lily said it was your time of the month.
UNK: You're welcome.
UNK: What are you doing?
UNK: Oh, just, um...
UNK: Rearranging the gifts.
UNK: The pile looked a bit precarious.
UNK: So...
UNK: Oh, don't worry. I'll keep an eye on it.
UNK: Great.
UNK: You do that.
UNK: You're gonna make a damn good nun.
Ted : As many times as robin told this story over the years,
UNK: She would never quite be able
UNK: To explain the logic of her next move.
UNK: Is this a strip show or a kiss concert?
UNK: Shh!
UNK: She's starting.
UNK: Please turn off your cell phones, pagers
UNK: And sense of shame.
UNK: All right, boys.
UNK: Lie back,
UNK: Get comfortable, and enjoy the show.
