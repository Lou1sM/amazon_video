UNK: Man, what a show, huh?
UNK: She did some disgusting stuff.
UNK: Really sticks with you.
UNK: I may be done eating.
UNK: Me, too.
UNK: I mean, like, forever.
UNK: Me, too.
UNK: I miss my wife.
Barney : Hey,
UNK: Let's go around the table
UNK: And say what our favorite part was.
UNK: Mine was that thing with the typewriter.
UNK: I mean,
UNK: She made some spelling mistakes, but still.
UNK: Ooh, and you guys were all,
UNK: "barney, put out the cigar!
UNK: It's a non-smoking room!"
UNK: And I was all, "hell, no, this is a cuban!"
UNK: Of course, eventually, I did put it out.
UNK: Did I put it out?
UNK: I put it out.
UNK: Did I put it out?
UNK: I put it out.
UNK: Did I put it out?
Ted : It was a small fire,
UNK: Not even big enough to force an evacuation of the hotel,
UNK: But definitely big enough to get us kicked out,
UNK: And bring marshall's bachelor party to an early end.
UNK: Is that...?
UNK: It is.
UNK: Hey, guys.
UNK: How was the fight?
UNK: Hey, what are you guys doing here?
UNK: What happened to the bachelor party?
UNK: We missed the fight, dinner was ruined,
UNK: We spent half the night in the hospital,
UNK: And got kicked out of the hotel.
UNK: What do you think happened? Lily : Barney.
UNK: Barney.
UNK: Hey, I was just trying to be a good best man.
UNK: You know what a best man does, barney?
UNK: He does what the groom wants.
UNK: But all you ever think about is what you want,
UNK: What's best for you.
UNK: Best man? I'm not even sure
UNK: I'm inviting you to the wedding at this point.
UNK: You don't mean that.
UNK: Why should I invite you?
UNK: You don't even want us to get married.
UNK: That's not true.
UNK: Lily, don't.
UNK: What?
UNK: I'm sorry, barney.
UNK: It happened last summer when we were broken up.
UNK: Hey, what are you guys talking about?
UNK: Lily.
UNK: Ah, I got to go.
UNK: âª
UNK: Newark airport, please.
UNK: Yeah, yeah, yeah. "barney, what are you doing here?"
UNK: "I can't believe it's really you.
UNK: "Come in, have a seat. Do you want some tea?
UNK: "I know the apartment's small, but I don't need much space.
UNK: "Let me show you some of my paintings.
UNK: "I think it's some of my best work ever." just stop it.
UNK: Lily, you have to come home.
UNK: You and marshall belong together.
UNK: The two of you have something
UNK: That most people search their whole lives for and never find.
UNK: I know you love him, and if you knew
UNK: What he was going through right now,
UNK: You wouldn't be here for one more second.
UNK: I bought you a ticket home.
UNK: Marshall is one of the best people I know,
UNK: And it won't be long until someone else realizes that,
UNK: And you'll lose him forever.
UNK: I can't stand the thought of that happening,
UNK: And I cannot keep stealing chicks from him forever.
UNK: Never, ever tell anyone I was here.
UNK: I will deny it tooth and nail.
UNK: This trip never happened.
UNK: Hey, if you had three hours to kill before your flight,
UNK: What would you do... Alcatraz or fisherman's wharf?
UNK: You really did that?
Ted : Marshall,
UNK: I think barney's your best man.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Yes, he is.
UNK: See, lily? This is why I didn't...
UNK: Really?
UNK: Really.
UNK: Real... In your face, loser!
UNK: Take it easy, all right.
UNK: Ted's still my best man, too.
UNK: You guys are co-best men.
Barney : Right.
UNK: Yes, we're both best man.
UNK: No, um, seriously.
UNK: You guys are co-best men.
UNK: Of course.
UNK: Oh, I'm saying, I'm agreeing we'll both be best men.
UNK: I can't believe you got me this.
UNK: Oh, I only did it as a joke.
UNK: I can return it for you if you want.
UNK: Oh, no, it's okay.
UNK: You don't have to go all the way back down there.
UNK: I'll, I'll just throw it away.
UNK: Well, I mean, if you're going to throw it away,
UNK: Maybe I'll take it in case I get invited
UNK: To another wedding shower.
UNK: It's a great gag gift.
UNK: Yeah, it's really funny.
UNK: You know who would get a kick out of it? Marshall.
UNK: So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it.
UNK: I would be embarrassed
UNK: If marshall found out that I bought it for you,
UNK: So I'd better just take it.
UNK: Robin, leave it.
