UNK: And robin showed up, gift in hand.
UNK: Funny story about that gift.
UNK: Hey, barney,
UNK: Check out what I got lily for her shower.
UNK: It's kind of racy.
UNK: Think you can handle it?
UNK: Uh, I've been in a ten-way.
UNK: So, yeah.
UNK: It's kind of see-through.
UNK: Hmm? Whoa-ho-ho!
UNK: You weren't kidding!
UNK: You know when you should give that to her?
UNK: 1850.
UNK: Robin, it's her bridal shower!
UNK: All her friends are gonna be there.
UNK: They're going to be drinking.
UNK: You need to get her something daring,
UNK: Something outrageous.
UNK: Well, what do you think I should get her?
UNK: There's a store on eighth avenue
UNK: That specializes in...
UNK: How to put this delicately?...
UNK: Uh, battery-powered, adult- recreational fake penises.
UNK: And so aunt robin went to a store on eighth avenue,
UNK: And bought a battery-powered, adult-recreational...
UNK: Well, it was something inappropriate.
