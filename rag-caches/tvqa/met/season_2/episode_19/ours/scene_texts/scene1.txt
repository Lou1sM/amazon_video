Ted : It took me a while to figure out,
UNK: But the key to understanding your uncle barney is this.
UNK: When times are hard, it's impossible to keep him around.
UNK: Like when your aunt lily and uncle marshall were broken up.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: What are you guys talking about?
UNK: Lily.
UNK: I got to go.
UNK: But when times are good, it's impossible to get rid of him.
UNK: What are you guys doing?
UNK: We just finished planning marshall's bachelor party.
UNK: Good, you haven't started yet.
UNK: Let's talk logistics.
UNK: Now, have you laid out ground rules with lily?
UNK: Where you are or aren't allowed
UNK: To touch or be touched?
UNK: Show me on ted.
UNK: Actually, we're, uh,
UNK: We're thinking of skipping the strippers.
UNK: You... You want to have a party
UNK: Mmm. Without strippers.
UNK: This was the worst thing I could have said.
UNK: You see, barney loved cooking up bachelor parties,
UNK: And it was always the same recipe.
UNK: You start with a slightly cramped hotel suite.
UNK: Arrange the chairs in a circle...
UNK: Fill them with your closest friends.
UNK: Turn the heat up to about 90.
UNK: Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke.
UNK: And then, right in the middle of the room,
UNK: You throw in a girl.
UNK: But not a beautiful girl...
UNK: No, if this girl was ever beautiful,
UNK: It was two kids, three tattoos,
UNK: And one pesky substance abuse problem ago.
UNK: Which one of you is stuart?
UNK: Please, I really don't want to do this.
UNK: Shut up. Put in your mouth guard.
Ted : Then she proceeds to do things
UNK: that demean the groom,
UNK: Herself and really, the entire human race.
UNK: Disgusting.
UNK: Ah, horrifying.
UNK: Classic.
Stuart : Oh, please, please, no, no.
UNK: I don't want anything like that happening to me.
UNK: Stuart's still trying to forget that night.
UNK: It's my bachelor party.
UNK: We're not having strippers.
UNK: Oh, he thinks he has a say in it.
UNK: So, strippers it is!
UNK: Now, just, uh,
UNK: Tell me where we're going to be
UNK: And I'll make some calls.
UNK: I think I can get the fourth one for free.
UNK: Quick question.
UNK: Prosthetic arm. Deal breaker?
UNK: Barney, there is...
UNK: Before you say no, it has attachments.
UNK: Look, I know you have some stuff planned
UNK: For marshall's bachelor party,
UNK: But he really doesn't want strippers.
UNK: Yes, he does.
UNK: Uh, well, he told me he doesn't.
UNK: Uh, well, he told me he does.
UNK: When?
UNK: Every minute of every day
UNK: As his inner animal thrashes against the cage
UNK: Of his own puritanical upbringing.
UNK: Or do you guys not like naked girls?
UNK: Um, we love naked girls.
UNK: They're one of the
UNK: Best things in the world.
UNK: It goes...
UNK: Naked girls, democracy,
UNK: The scene in every which way but loose
UNK: Where the monkey gives a guy the finger.
UNK: Mm.
UNK: We just don't like your naked girls.
UNK: What, my girls aren't hot enough?
UNK: I mean, all right, fine,
UNK: The stripper at stuart's bachelor party was a 15.
UNK: She was 15?
UNK: No, a 15.
UNK: Like in blackjack.
UNK: As in, not sure whether you'd hit it?
UNK: Exactly.
UNK: Nice.
UNK: This is important to marshall.
UNK: So, promise me, no strippers.
UNK: All right, I promise.
UNK: I'm serious.
UNK: So am I.
UNK: No strippers.
UNK: Now say it without winking.
UNK: No strippers.
UNK: You just winked.
UNK: No, I didn't.
UNK: So, when the day arrived,
UNK: We all climbed into a rented escalade and set out.
UNK: Now, every bachelor party is usually made up
UNK: Of the same stock characters.
UNK: You've got the groom...
UNK: The best man...
UNK: The guy who speaks only in clichÃ©s...
UNK: Dead man walking!
UNK: The guy who disappears at the beginning of the night
UNK: And doesn't show up again until the end.
UNK: All right,
UNK: Who's up for a little blackjack before we check in?
UNK: No, no, no. Mm-mmm. None for me.
UNK: See you guys back at the room, then.
UNK: And, of course, well...
UNK: Barney.
UNK: Every bachelor party has a barney.
UNK: Oh, what's this?
UNK: This car has a dvd player?
UNK: You mean, we could have been watching
UNK: These pornos the whole time?
UNK: Yeah. This one's in hd.
UNK: This one's in h-double-d.
UNK: Oh!
UNK: That same night, aunt lily
UNK: Was having a wedding shower,
