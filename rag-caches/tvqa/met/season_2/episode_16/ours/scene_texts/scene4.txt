UNK: Ted voix off : I packed up everything
UNK: Ted voix off : I had gotten from ex-girlfriends.
UNK: Ted voix off : It was painful,
UNK: Ted voix off : But not as painful as what I had to endure later that night.
UNK: Ted voix off : New york is famous for its theater,
UNK: Ted voix off : But there's many different levels.
UNK: Ted voix off : There's broadway, off-broadway, off-off-broadway,
UNK: Ted voix off : Homeless people screaming in the park,
UNK: Ted voix off : And then below that, the play aunt lily was in.
Robin : Eight flights of stairs.
Robin : Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs?
Robin : What kind of building is this?
Barney : From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.
UNK: Hey, where do you guys want to sit?
Barney : I know where I don't want to sit.
UNK: Marshall in the front row : Guys, four together!
Barney : I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.
Robin : Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.
Barney : No? Okay.
Lily : Shh.
UNK: Man 1 : I... Am... Rage!
Woman : I... Am greed.
Lily : I am rage... Envy!
Barney : I am outta here.
Marshall : No, you're not. You have to stay.
Lily : This is the face of consumerism!
Ted : Oh, my god. Ted's part of the play.
UNK: Man 2 : Hello, greed, rage...
Lily : Envy...
UNK: Man 2 : And consumerism.
UNK: Ted voix off : I...
UNK: Man 2 : Am your father...
UNK: Man 2 : America!
Marshall : Oh, baby, that was wonderful!
Ted : Totally, I had no idea greed was the killer.
Robin : And when it became a play within a play,
Robin : I was, like, "now we are really cookin'!"
Barney : Wow, lily, that sucked!
Marshall : Barney!
Barney : What? It was terrible.
Barney : I mean, come on. You guys agree, right?
Barney : Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest
Barney : 'cause, you know, we're friends.
Lily : No, friends make each other feel good.
Lily : They build each other up and support them.
Lily : That's what being a good friend is about.
Barney : Yeah, if you're a smurf.
Lily : You know if you did a play, I would sit through
Lily : The whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.
UNK: Oh, really? You would? Yes.
Barney : Bad move, aldrin, bad move.
Man : We'll be starting
Man : Our q&a with the director...
Man : Yours truly... In five minutes right here.
Robin : Can you believe barney said that about lily's play?
Ted : I know. He can be really insensitive.
UNK: Yeah... It was pretty bad, though.
Ted : Oh, my god, it was so bad.
Robin : Oh, my god, you've been robbed!
Ted : Nope.
Robin : All that stuff was from old girlfriends?
Robin : Don't you buy anything for yourself?
Ted : What can I say?
Ted : Papa gets swag.
UNK: Mmm...
UNK: Ted voix off : And that should've been the end of it.
UNK: Ted voix off : But the next day...
Ted : You know, at first I was really bummed
Ted : About getting rid of all my stuff.
Ted : But seeing how happy it makes you... totally worth it.
Robin : Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly
UNK: Have sex with you when I'm really tired.
Ted : Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team.
Ted : Well, sit.
Ted : Sit, yeah.
Ted : So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?
Ted : Nope.
Robin : Well, except for my dogs.
