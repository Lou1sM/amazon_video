Lily : You're gonna kill your dogs?!
Robin : No! No, no, no, there really is a farm.
Robin : My aunt has a farm upstate.
Lily : Oh, thank god.
Lily : Aw, you know, if I were five dogs,
Lily : I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in brooklyn.
Robin : Yeah. I could visit them on weekends.
Robin : My aunt is awfully lonely up there.
Robin : It's just her and her lover, betty.
Lily : Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.
Robin : "They"? What do you mean by "they"?
Lily : Uh... Uh... Uh...
Lily : People upstate.
Lily : Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!
Marshall : Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Marshall : I mean, you know that this is gonna be... I know,
Lily : But I'm gonna sit through the whole thing,
Lily : And I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards.
Lily : You know why?
Lily : Because that's what friends do. Hmm.
