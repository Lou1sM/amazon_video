Robin : Moist.
Robin : Moist.
Robin : Moist.
Robin : Moist.
Ted : That was the first 40 minutes of barney's show.
Robin : Moist.
UNK: Ted voix off : And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.
Barney : I have to go refill.
Barney : I'll be back in a moment.
Barney : Play's not over.
Marshall : I never get picked for audience participation.
UNK: Ted voix off : And then it just got weird.
Robin : Feelings.
Barney : Inside.
Barney : Oh, no!
Barney : Beep, beep, beep.
UNK: Beep.
Ted : And when that didn't work...
Lily : Okay!
Lily : Stop!
Lily : You win. Fine.
Lily : Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.
Barney : Thank you, lily.
Barney : Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?
Ted : No.
Lily : No, I have nothing nice to say about your show.
Lily : You were right, barney.
Lily : Let's go to the bar.
Barney : Yes! I win!
Barney : I love winning!
Barney : Oh, lily.
Barney : Oh, lily, lily, lily.
UNK: I was just getting warmed up, man!
UNK: If you had any idea what was coming up in act two... Oh!
Lily : Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.
Barney : Pretty awful? Pretty awful?!
Barney : It was a masterpiece of awful.
Barney : It's genius how bad it is.
Barney : I kind of wish you guys could see it.
Lily : Yeah, well, anyway.
UNK: Act two is where I really hit my stride.
UNK: Spoiler alert : The robot falls in love.
UNK: How about this, barney?
UNK: How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?
Barney : It's your funeral.
Barney : Five, six, one, two.
UNK: Ted voix off : So we stayed and let barney torture us
UNK: Ted voix off : For another hour and a half,
UNK: Ted voix off : 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.
Marshall : Hey.
Ted : Where've you been?
Ted : I called you earlier.
Robin : I gave my dogs away to my aunt.
Ted : You what?
Robin : Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but...
Robin : I think it's for the best.
Robin : Wow.
Ted : Oh, man.
Ted : Aw...
Robin : Can we go inside?
Ted : Uh, no.
UNK: Uh, let's go to the bar. Why?
Robin : What's going on inside? Um, the floors are gone.
UNK: What? Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed.
Ted : This is a terrible lie.
Ted : I'm just going to bail.
Ted : I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!
Robin : You said you threw all that stuff away!
Ted : Kids, this was the worst fight robin and I ever had.
UNK: Ted voix off : It was one of those fights that last for hours
UNK: Ted voix off : And you start to get woozy and lose track
UNK: Ted voix off : Of what you're fighting about.
UNK: Ted voix off : We fought for so long,
UNK: Ted voix off : Seasons changed outside the window.
UNK: Ted voix off : Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy.
UNK: Ted voix off : But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how
UNK: Ted voix off : For the life of me, but somehow we got to here.
Robin : We're really doing this?
Ted : Yeah.
UNK: Ted and Robin : We're moving in together! We're moving in together!
UNK: Congratulations! Thank you.
