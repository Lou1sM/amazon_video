UNK: Didn't even notice.
UNK: Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit.
UNK: Tell me about the fabric.
UNK: Is it foreign or something?
UNK: Wow. It is foreign.
UNK: I'm impressed, ted.
UNK: It's moroccan, actually. Whoa.
UNK: I got a call for swarley.
UNK: Is a swarley here?
UNK: You weren't interested
UNK: In my suit at all, were you?
UNK: Hmm? Swarley!
UNK: Yeah, I know he's there.
Ted : It's really important.
UNK: Could you ask again?
UNK: Important call for swarley!
Marshall : Geez,
UNK: Can't you hear him, swarley?
UNK: There's a call for you.
UNK: Stop calling me that.
UNK: Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys
UNK: To officially meet chloe.
UNK: Hi. Hi. Hi.
UNK: It's nice to meet you guys.
UNK: I'll be right back.
UNK: It's right back there.
UNK: Right?
UNK: Right? She's hot!
UNK: And she likes me?
UNK: She likes italian food.
UNK: I also like italian food.
UNK: She likes billy joel.
UNK: I also like... Music.
UNK: And I think
UNK: We're going to go out again.
UNK: Dude, you gotta ditch her.
UNK: Obviously.
UNK: What? Why?
UNK: She's got the crazy eyes.
UNK: Dude. The eyes.
UNK: They're crazy.
UNK: What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes?
UNK: It's a well-documented
UNK: Condition of the pupils, or pupi.
UNK: No. Just pupils.
UNK: It's an indicator of future mental instability.
UNK: She does not have the crazy eyes.
UNK: You just can't see it because you're afflicted
UNK: With "haven't been laid in a while" blindness.
UNK: She was too far away in the coffee place,
UNK: But when I saw her up close, just now...
UNK: Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet chloe.
UNK: Hi. Hi. Hi.
UNK: It's nice to meet you guys.
UNK: You guys, I'm not going to stop dating chloe
UNK: Just because you think she has the crazy eyes.
UNK: You can keep going out with her,
UNK: But you're gonna regret it.
UNK: One time, I met a girl at this very bar.
UNK: I saw that she had the crazy eyes...
UNK: But I ignored it.
UNK: And then, sure enough.
UNK: Barney, can I ask you a question?
Ted : Anything.
UNK: Would you like to have a threesome?
UNK: Of course.
UNK: Great. It'd be me, you, and mr. Weasels.
UNK: So, did you do it?
UNK: No. It ended up being just a twosome
UNK: With the third one watching from a chair.
UNK: Which one were you?
UNK: I'd rather not say.
UNK: Look, there was a time I didn't believe
UNK: In the crazy eyes either, and then I met jeanine.
UNK: She had serious crazy eyes.
UNK: I told myself I was just imagining it, but then...
UNK: So, should we go get a drink?
UNK: As long as it's in your apartment.
UNK: Whoa, I'm sorry.
UNK: Watch! Where! You're! Going!
UNK: So, where do you live?
UNK: You guys, chloe is not gonna do any of that stuff.
UNK: She's a nice girl from nebraska.
UNK: She's not crazy.
UNK: She's... She's awesome.
UNK: But you can't avoid the crazy eyes forever.
UNK: Sooner or later, the crazy comes bubbling to the surface.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Marshall, it's chloe.
UNK: Are you the one who's called me, like, nine times?
