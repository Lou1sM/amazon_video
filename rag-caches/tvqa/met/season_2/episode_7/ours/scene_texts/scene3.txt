UNK: Yeah. Could you come get me?
UNK: I'm in the middle of taking a test.
UNK: Please. I'm so scared.
UNK: Well, what's going on?
UNK: This weird midget guy started following me
UNK: And he was screaming at me
UNK: And he had a limp and a big hump on his back
UNK: And the police didn't believe me
UNK: And I almost got trampled by a horse and...
UNK: God, I must sound totally crazy to you right now.
Lily : No.
UNK: Pfft.
UNK: Not at all.
UNK: So, she's needy crazy.
UNK: That's one of the worst kinds.
UNK: I've had one of those.
UNK: Makes up stories to get attention.
UNK: Went out with her for three weeks... her dad died twice.
UNK: Guys, she was really freaked out, okay?
UNK: Maybe the story is true.
UNK: What in the world
UNK: Would make you believe that's a true story?
UNK: She's really hot.
UNK: They always are.
UNK: You all done with that, ted?
UNK: Yeah. Ned.
UNK: I told you to call him ned.
UNK: That's just sad.
UNK: Sorry, swarley.
UNK: So, do just you and ted live here
UNK: Or does swarley live here, too?
UNK: Nah. "swahili" has his own place.
UNK: What was that?
UNK: Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.
Robin : Oh.
UNK: So, here you go.
UNK: Two pumpkin beers.
UNK: I was joking. They're regular beers.
UNK: What is that?
UNK: This picture is broken.
UNK: Oh. That's too bad.
UNK: Is that lily?
UNK: Is that the girl you were going to marry?
UNK: Yeah. Is that what that sound was?
UNK: Did you just smash this?
Lily : No.
UNK: Why would I do that?
UNK: Let me look into your eyes.
Ted : Okay.
UNK: I had a really nice time tonight.
UNK: Yeah, me, too.
UNK: Stop blinking.
UNK: I like your eyes a lot, too.
UNK: Stop!
UNK: Hi. I'm lily.
UNK: Stop!
UNK: Now, I know aunt lily hiding in the apartment
UNK: While uncle marshall was on a date with another girl
UNK: Seems pretty crazy, but when you hear
UNK: Her side of the story, well, it's still pretty crazy.
UNK: What's up, swarlz? No.
UNK: Okay? No. No more.
UNK: I will not let this become a thing.
UNK: It's over.
UNK: No more swarley. No swarlz.
UNK: âª No more swar-lay
UNK: âª no more swar... Wait for it... Ley âª
UNK: No more bob swarley, mon.
UNK: No more.
UNK: No!
UNK: It's over.
UNK: Do you understand?
UNK: Yes. Yes.
Lily : Thank you.
Lily : Nice.
UNK: Why didn't you call me? Was I supposed to call you?
UNK: Yes, about the whole marshall- dating-another-girl thing.
UNK: You said you were fine with it.
UNK: Yeah, in front of ted, but then I shot you a look.
UNK: What look?
Ted : This.
UNK: That doesn't seem like a look.
UNK: Yes it is. It means, "I'm upset call me later."
UNK: You should have pulled me aside and told me what the look meant.
UNK: If I pulled you aside, I wouldn't need the look.
UNK: Well, maybe if it was a more distinctive look...
UNK: Okay, the look isn't important.
UNK: What's important is that I can't stand the idea
UNK: Of marshall dating another woman.
UNK: I mean, what if
UNK: He falls in love with her?
UNK: Well, if it makes you feel any better,
UNK: Ted says she has the crazy eyes.
UNK: What's that?
UNK: Apparently, a thing women have that guys can see
UNK: And it tells them that the girl's crazy.
UNK: Oh, kind of like how you never want to date a guy
UNK: With perfect fingernails?
UNK: Jerk nails. Exactly.
UNK: Well, did-did ted say whether she was good-looking?
UNK: I mean, 'cause if I knew she was ugly,
UNK: Then maybe I wouldn't be so freaked out.
UNK: Uh, he didn't say, but you can find out.
UNK: I think her name is chloe...
UNK: She works at cosa coffee on 78th.
UNK: Phone call for swarles barkley?
UNK: Carl.
UNK: Hey, ted. No, he's not here.
UNK: Good one, though... Remember that one.
UNK: Is, um,
UNK: Chloe here?
UNK: She just left.
