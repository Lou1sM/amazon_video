UNK: She's not fat, but that doesn't mean anything.
UNK: I know tons of skinny, ugly women.
UNK: That's right, snotty girl in my yoga class,
UNK: I'm talking to you.
UNK: Come on, chloe, turn around.
UNK: Here we go. Turn around, chloe.
UNK: Come on, show me that hideous face.
UNK: Damn it!
UNK: Ooh, I know, I'll get ahead of her,
UNK: Then I'll cut back so I...
UNK: Aah!
UNK: Turn around!
UNK: Come on! Just turn around!
UNK: Okay, this is ridiculous.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Turn around! What's the matter with you?
UNK: Hey, you!
UNK: Turn around!
UNK: Turn around, chloe!
UNK: She's hot? I'm so sorry.
UNK: No, it's fine.
UNK: I-it just makes things easier.
UNK: Now that I know she's a threat, all I have to do
UNK: Is keep marshall from ever seeing her again.
UNK: Okay, I have two plans... You can help me choose.
UNK: Plan a... remember that time marshall and I
UNK: Had sex in the bathroom?
UNK: Oops, I got knocked up.
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Lily.
UNK: Okay, plan b
UNK: Is called "chloe's accident."
UNK: Just stop. What?
UNK: Lily, you can't do any of those things.
UNK: If you two are ever gonna get back together,
UNK: You have to let him work out whatever this is.
UNK: I know. You're right.
UNK: Now, come on, ted asked us to be upstairs at 6 : 00.
UNK: Some surprise for barney.
UNK: Barney?
UNK: Uh, swarley.
UNK: Hey, guys. Hey.
UNK: Hey. Where's marshall?
UNK: Oh, he's getting a haircut.
UNK: Oh. For his date.
UNK: Good for him.
UNK: Hope he has a good time tonight.
UNK: Relax, you've got nothing to worry about.
UNK: The girl's crazy.
UNK: Thanks! He'll just have
UNK: Wild monkey sex with her five times, max,
UNK: And be done with her.
UNK: Thanks again.
UNK: Mr Druthers : What are you doing?
UNK: I just wanted to listen
UNK: To a little music, that's all.
Deejay : And this next one's going out to swarley.
UNK: All your friends know you miss barney,
UNK: But he's gone, and you got to accept that, baby.
UNK: And, swarley, you're gonna be a better woman for it.
UNK: Here's "I am woman" by helen reddy.
UNK: âª I am woman...
UNK: Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it!
UNK: You know, I was thinking
UNK: About this whole new name thing last night,
UNK: And you know what I realized?
UNK: I like it.
UNK: You like being called swarley?
Ted : Are you kidding? I want you to call me that.
UNK: Do you really think this is gonna work?
UNK: Do I think what's gonna work?
UNK: I'm just saying, I love my new name,
UNK: So please only call me that from now on.
UNK: Call you what?
Ted : You know, that-that-that new name
UNK: That you've been calling me.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Say it.
UNK: Why? You guys know what it is.
UNK: Say the name.
UNK: No, I don't want to!
UNK: I hate it! I hate it!
UNK: It's not funny!
UNK: It's never been funny! I've never done any...
UNK: No!
UNK: Man, he is really gonna lose it
UNK: When all the magazine subscriptions start coming in.
UNK: I signed him up for people in espanol,
UNK: But I addressed it to swarlos.
UNK: Hey, where's the picture of marshall and me at the pier?
UNK: Didn't it used to be by that window?
UNK: Oh, yeah, he, uh, he sort of took it down when you left.
UNK: Put it behind some books, I think.
UNK: Oh, well-well, maybe I should put it back up.
UNK: Why, so chloe'll see it and get scared off?
Lily : No.
UNK: So marshall'll see it and feel guilty.
UNK: Yeah, okay.
Ted : But she wasn't okay.
UNK: Later that night, while marshall was on his date,
