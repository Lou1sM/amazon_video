UNK: Lily arriving : Anymore.
UNK: Pretty impressive, huh?
UNK: Wow, you really did memorize all the lyrics
UNK: To "we didn't start the fire."
Marshall : Yeah.
Marshall : Can I, uh, can I
UNK: Get you a drink? I'd love a beer.
UNK: You got it.
UNK: Lily did what any sensible woman would do.
UNK: And she stayed there, listening to her ex-fiance
UNK: On a date with another woman.
Chloe : I had a really nice time tonight.
Marshall : Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.
UNK: I like your eyes a lot, too.
UNK: Until, finally, much like billy joel,
UNK: She couldn't take it anymore.
UNK: Stop!
Ted : Hi.
UNK: I'm lily.
UNK: Ted from 2030 : Lily...
UNK: Lily, what the hell are you doing?
UNK: I don't know. I...
UNK: I don't know... What I'm doing.
UNK: Oh, pumpkin beer... That was a good one.
UNK: I'm just... I'm gonna go.
UNK: I... I'm so sorry.
UNK: En-enjoy the rest of your date.
UNK: She seems nice.
UNK: Lilly, what the hell... I'm sorry.
UNK: I only snuck up there because...
UNK: When I saw how cute she was yesterday, I freaked out.
UNK: Lily, you saw her yesterday?
Marshall : Yeah, I...
UNK: Kind of chased her down the street.
UNK: Wait, so you were the hunchback with the limp?
Marshall : Yeah.
UNK: And she didn't break the picture, I did.
UNK: So chloe's not crazy, she's...
UNK: Just a nice, normal girl.
UNK: Yeah, she is.
UNK: And you deserve a nice, normal girl.
UNK: So, why don't you just go back up there
UNK: And-and finish your date.
Marshall : Yeah.
Ted : Okay.
Ted : Okay.
UNK: Wait, if you were the hunchback,
UNK: Then why did she think you were a guy?
UNK: I-I might have used a voice
UNK: That sounded like this.
Ted : Why?
UNK: Because I didn't want her to know it was me,
UNK: Which I now realize doesn't make sense,
UNK: Because she hadn't even met me.
UNK: You're crazy.
UNK: You have... Crazier eyes than anybody that I have ever met.
UNK: Shouldn't you be going back up...
UNK: I mean, you're out of your mind.
Ted : You're... Just absolutely insane.
UNK: Shouldn't you be going back upstairs?
UNK: I've missed you so much.
UNK: Okay, I ran it by the group,
UNK: And we decided we're gonna give you a choice.
UNK: We will agree to stop calling you swarley,
UNK: But instead, we'll call you Jennifer.
UNK: Well?
UNK: I'm thinking.
UNK: How about this? Mm-hmm?
UNK: On mondays, wednesdays and fridays...
Ted : Hey.
UNK: Look at this.
UNK: That six months earlier I had walked up and found
UNK: Marshall alone, crying over his breakup with lily,
UNK: I found him again.
UNK: Only this time he wasn't alone, and he was happy.
UNK: So we went to the bar to celebrate, and it was great.
UNK: I was with robin, marshall and lily were back together,
UNK: Until we got back to the apartment.
Barney : Oh, my god.
UNK: Hey, chloe, I...
UNK: Guess I forgot I left you up here.
UNK: I was gonna leave, but I can't find my keys.
UNK: They're right there on the coffee table.
UNK: Silly me.
UNK: I must have looked
UNK: Everywhere else.
UNK: Well... I'm just gonna go.
UNK: Oh, I don't think we've met.
UNK: I'm chloe.
Ted : Robin.
UNK: It's nice to meet you, roland.
UNK: I'll see you guys later.
UNK: Roland?
UNK: Your name's roland.
UNK: That's funny, right?
UNK: Rock and roland.
UNK: Warsaw is the capital of what?
UNK: Roland.
UNK: You're monica roland-ski.
UNK: Hey, yeah,
UNK: That's just how I roland.
UNK: Nice try, swarley. Damn it.
UNK: âª Sometimes you want to go
UNK: âª where everybody knows your name âª
UNK: âª And they're always glad you came... âª
