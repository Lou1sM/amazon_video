UNK: So, I guess that decides it.
UNK: Yup.
UNK: Is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.
UNK: Man, what's that?
Robin : What?
UNK: That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name.
UNK: âª Somebody has a crush on you âª
UNK: âª Somebody thinks you're me. âª
UNK: Do you really think she likes me?
UNK: I mean, I guess it's not that surprising.
UNK: Every time I come in here, I do totally crack her up.
UNK: Marshall, here's your pumpkin latte.
UNK: Wow. How did you fit a pumpkin in this little cup?
UNK: I'll have a pumpkin latte.
UNK: How do they even fit a pumpkin in those little cups?
UNK: What? You got a shrink ray back there?
Marshall : Yeah.
UNK: Hey, remember that time I said that thing
UNK: About how do they fit a pumpkin
UNK: Into the little cup?
UNK: Which time? The first time.
UNK: Yeah. That was really funny.
Marshall : Right.
UNK: All right, there's only two reasons she'd laugh at that.
UNK: One, it's the first joke she's ever heard,
UNK: Or two, she likes you.
UNK: You should totally ask her out.
UNK: You think?
UNK: Yeah, that why you're not
UNK: Back with lily, right? So you can experience
UNK: What it's like to be single.
UNK: Well, what if the heart
UNK: Doesn't mean anything?
UNK: What if she writes it on all the cups?
UNK: Mine says "ted," no heart.
UNK: Mine says... "swarley."
UNK: How'd they get "swarley" from "barney"?
UNK: It's not even a name.
UNK: Who would ever be called "swarley"?
UNK: Oh, please don't start calling me "swarley."
UNK: This would never happen at a bar!
UNK: Man! What's up with swarley?
UNK: I know. You almost never see old swarlz get that upset.
UNK: Psssh.
UNK: Hey, guess what?
UNK: Oh, sorry.
UNK: It's only my mom.
UNK: She's just rambling on like always.
UNK: Uh-huh.
Ted : What happened?
UNK: Marshall asked out a girl.
UNK: Wow. Well, if anything, that's dad's fault.
UNK: That'll keep her going a while.
UNK: Oh, of course, you know, he had a little help.
UNK: Swarley hooked him up?
UNK: Oh, good. You got my text.
UNK: Yeah. Oh. No, it was me.
UNK: I gave marshall one of my secrets.
UNK: So, what'd she say?
Ted : Nothing.
UNK: I don't think she heard me.
UNK: It's pretty busy up there.
UNK: What? You gave her the look, right?
UNK: Head down, eyes looking up,
UNK: Hands in pockets, shoulders up,
UNK: Head slightly tilted, conveying shy vulnerability.
UNK: I think so.
UNK: Look, can we just go?
UNK: Pumpkin latte
UNK: For marshall.
UNK: I didn't order that.
