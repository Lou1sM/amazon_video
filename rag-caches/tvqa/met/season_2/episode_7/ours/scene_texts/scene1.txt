UNK: Phone number.
UNK: I love that look.
UNK: I think I slept with you because of that look.
UNK: And it's fake?
UNK: Oh, and you biting your lower lip,
UNK: Shyly looking away and thrusting your chest out is natural?
UNK: Yeah, I hear you.
UNK: Hey! Hey. Hey, guys.
UNK: Are you free tomorrow night?
UNK: I was thinking of having a wine tasting
UNK: Slash "help me catch the rat in my apartment" party.
UNK: That's a great idea.
UNK: You can put out cheese for both.
UNK: I should invite marshall, right?
UNK: It'd be weird if I didn't.
UNK: Yeah, I don't think he can go.
UNK: Really? Why not?
UNK: Uh, okay, um...
UNK: Lily, we have to tell you something.
UNK: Marshall has a date.
UNK: Oh. Well... Good for him.
UNK: Really? You're okay with it?
UNK: Look, we've been broken up almost six months.
UNK: I mean, I'm not thrilled about the idea,
UNK: But he has every right to date someone else.
UNK: That's very mature.
UNK: Why are you holding the phone?
UNK: Oh, shoot.
UNK: That's hilarious, mom.
