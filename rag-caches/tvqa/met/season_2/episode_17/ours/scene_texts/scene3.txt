Ted : Remember the 100k fiasco?
Marshall : Ah, the fiero-asco.
Ted : Dude, I told you that doesn't work.
Ted : It's the 100k fiasco.
Robin : What's the 100k fiasco?
Marshall : The fiero-asco?
Ted : It was just before winter break
Ted : Our freshman year of college.
Ted : Marshall and I were roommates,
Ted : But we weren't really good friends yet.
Marshall : I thought ted was a little bit pretentious.
Ted : And marshall was a total slob.
Marshall : Hey.
UNK: Um... I'm driving
Marshall : My fiero back over break.
Marshall : I know we see enough of each other as it is,
UNK: But, uh, if you want a ride, I could use the gas money.
Marshall : You live in ohio, right?
Marshall : I could swing through and pick you up.
Ted : All right, first of all, my parents live in ohio.
Ted : I live in the moment.
Ted : Plus,
Ted : Karen and I haven't seen each other since thanksgiving.
UNK: I mean, we're both really invested
Ted : In making this long-distance thing work, so...
Marshall : All right, well, call me if you change your mind.
Marshall : My odometer's going to hit 100k.
Ted : No.
Ted : She'd be so bummed if I left early.
Ted : It was totally mutual.
Ted : I mean, karen brought it up first, but I...
Ted : It was... It was totally mutual.
UNK: âª When I wake up...
Marshall : I hear you.
Ted : So what's up with you and lily? Anything serious?
Marshall : Yeah.
Marshall : Dude, we're college freshmen.
Marshall : I'm not going to get tied down
Marshall : By the first chick I hook up with.
UNK: I mean, lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?
UNK: Ted voix off : The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.
UNK: âª I would walk 500 miles
UNK: âª and I would walk...
UNK: âª ...Know I'm gonna be
UNK: âª I'm gonna be the man who's walking... âª
UNK: âª Ia-da-la-da-la- da-la-da-da... âª
Ted : So... This song.
Marshall : Oh, it's the best song in the world.
Marshall : It's the only song I like.
Marshall : Just kidding.
Marshall : Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years.
Marshall : Better than nothing, though.
UNK: Ted voix off : Maybe.
UNK: âª Da-la-da, da-la-da âª da-la-da, da-la-da
UNK: âª da-la-da âª da-la-da
UNK: âª da-da-da-da-la- da-la-da-la-da-la! âª
Ted : I am so... Sick... Of this song.
Marshall : Don't worry. It comes around again.
Ted : What do you mean?
Both : âª just to be the man who walks a thousand miles âª
UNK: âª And falls down at your door... âª
UNK: Ooh.
Marshall : Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.
UNK: Yeah, that was probably, like, our best one.
Ted : Hey, you want to play zitch dog?
Marshall : What?
Ted : Uh, it's a car game.
Ted : Every time you see a dog,
Ted : You got to be the first one to say, "zitch dog."
UNK: Mm. Yeah, I'm pretty good, so...
UNK: Zitch dog. Uh...
UNK: What? No, I didn't know we had... We'd started,
UNK: But, uh, okay, that's cool.
Ted : You got the first point.
UNK: Zitch dog. Zitch dog.
Ted : Damn it!
Ted : Are we still playing?
Ted : 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...
Marshall : 12-nothing.
Ted : Marshall.
UNK: âª Da-la-da, da-la-da, da-la-da, da-la-da âª
Ted : Marshall.
Marshall : Zitch dog, blue suburban.
Ted : Damn it!
Marshall : 18-nothing.
Ted : Then marshall, who was so busy cheating at zitch dog,
UNK: Ted voix off : Got us totally lost.
Marshall : Where the hell are we?!
Marshall : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
UNK: Ted voix off : Hold on.
Marshall : I think you skipped something.
Barney : Really?
Barney : Seems impossible.
Ted : Hey, we got some time.
Ted : What do you say we get off the highway,
Ted : Take the road less traveled, you know?
Ted : Robert frost.
Marshall : Doesn't seem like a smart idea.
Ted : Too late.
Ted : I'm taking this exit.
Ted : Who's not fun enough now, karen?
Marshall : Then we got lost.
Marshall : Where the hell are we?!
Ted : No, keep driving. We're almost out of gas,
Marshall : And we might not even be on a road anymore.
Ted : It's below zero out.
Ted : If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days.
Ted : Plus, I only have, like,
Ted : Six granola bars and three bottles of water.
UNK: Nah, I threw them out. What?!
Marshall : No food or drink in the fiero.
UNK: No food or drink in the f...?
UNK: You haven't washed your sheets since orientation!
Ted : Thus began the longest night of our lives.
Marshall : Pretty sure that my foot is frozen s-solid.
Ted : Marshall...
Ted : There's a very real chance
Ted : That we're gonna be snowed in here for days.
Ted : If I die first, do whatever you need to survive.
Ted : Eat my flesh.
Ted : Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.
Marshall : Thanks, ted.
Marshall : You're a good friend.
Marshall : And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.
Marshall : What?
Ted : I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.
Marshall : Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.
Ted : But... But you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.
Marshall : Wasn't an easy decision.
Ted : This is all because of your insane no-food rule.
Marshall : It's perfectly rational.
Ted : Hey!
Ted : My spectacles!
Marshall : Hey.
Ted : I know we're low on gas,
Ted : But can we turn on the heat for just a minute?
Ted : Okay.
UNK: âª Da-la-da, da-la-da, da-la-da, da-la-da âª
UNK: âª Ia-da-la-da-la- da-la-da-da... âª
Ted : Dude...
Marshall : I hate to say this...
Marshall : But it's so cold...
Marshall : There's only one way
Marshall : That we're gonna make it through this night.
Marshall : We should've kept driving.
Ted : Come on, marshall.
Marshall : No. No.
Marshall : We might die now.
Marshall : I may never see lily again.
Marshall : I never told anybody this, but...
Marshall : I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl.
Marshall : If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her.
Marshall : I'm sorry about your spectacles.
Ted : That's okay.
Ted : They were decorative.
Ted : Hey, marshall.
Marshall : Yeah?
Ted : Are you still thinking about lily?
Marshall : Yeah.
Ted : Please stop.
Ted : And so marshall and I thought
Ted : We were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere.
Ted : But... funny thing...
Marshall : Hey.
Man : You lovers better just keep on driving.
Marshall : Zitch dog!
Ted : Damn it!
