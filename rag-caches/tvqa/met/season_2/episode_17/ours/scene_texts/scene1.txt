Ted : This is awesome.
Marshall : I can't believe this moment's finally here.
Marshall : One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.
Ted : Your baby fiero's grown into a really old man fiero.
Ted : And just like an old man, leaks fluid, smells stale,
Ted : Makes weird noises out the back.
Marshall : Yeah, he does.
Marshall : Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment.
Marshall : They're real cubans.
Marshall : I got 'em in chinatown last year just for this moment.
Ted : Uh, marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off,
UNK: But, um, these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.
Marshal : What are you talking about? Whoa,
UNK: Pothole. What? No.
UNK: Whoa. No.
UNK: No, no, n-n-n-no.
UNK: No, there's only .8 miles to go.
Marshall : Come on, buddy.
Marshall : Buddy!
Ted : Is it cool if I still light these?
