Lily : But then he'd learn to stop being mean.
Robin : Hey, guys. What's going on?
Ted : Lily stole my boss' baseball,
UNK: Mr Druthers : Signed three times by pete rose.
Robin : Why? Was he being mean?
Ted : You know about this?
Robin : Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice.
Robin : Did you tell him about that time at the gap?
UNK: Ooh, that was a good one.
Lily : This sales guy was rude to robin,
Lily : So I took a pair of khakis.
Robin : I gave them to you for your birthday.
Ted : So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?
Lily : I prefer to call them "justice khakis."
Ted : That's not justice.
Ted : It's shoplifting, and it's a crime.
Ted : Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense.
Ted : In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished.
Ted : Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.
Lily : Well, that's why I left a note.
Ted : A note?
Lily : Yeah. When he finds it,
Lily : He'll understand why his ball was taken away,
Lily : He'll stop being mean,
Lily : And the office will be a nicer place to work.
Lily : Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.
Ted : Look, lil, we're all tolerating
Ted : This prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having,
Ted : With the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny,
Ted : But this is my career you're messing with.
Lily : I'm not sure I like your tone.
Lily : You know what? Now you just lost the ball.
