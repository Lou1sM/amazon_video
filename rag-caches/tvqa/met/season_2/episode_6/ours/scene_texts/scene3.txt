Lily : What design?
UNK: It's nothing. It's fantastic.
Robin : Just for fun, ted's been working on his own design,
Robin : And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia.
Robin : At least, not healthy male genitalia.
Lily : Ted, you should pitch your building to druthers.
Ted : Are you kidding? He's hammond druthers.
Ted : He's a legend.
Ted : I'm just part of his team.
Ted : This building is huge for the firm,
Ted : So it's really important we don't blow it.
Ted : All right, enough.
Barney : Oh, my god.
Barney : Incredible.
UNK: Hmm... C-minus.
UNK: C-minus?
Barney : What are you talking about?
Barney : I just pulled an all-nighter!
UNK: Pr Lewis : You didn't budget your time well,
UNK: Pr Lewis : You glossed over some of the most important points,
UNK: Pr Lewis : And your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.
Lily : Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees
Lily : Or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
Lily : Then he stared at me until I laughed.
Ted : Okay, I'm done.
Lily : Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.
Ted : Great. Thanks.
UNK: Oh, finally.
UNK: Mr Druthers : I wondered whether you were making the trees
Lily : Or waiting for them to sprout on their own.
Ted : Good one, sir.
Ted : Anyway, here they are.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Hmm.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Too green.
Ted : Too green?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Almost brunette.
UNK: Mr Druthers : And think bushier.
UNK: Mr Druthers : I want this tower to rise
UNK: Mr Druthers : From a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Can you picture it, ted?
Ted : I can't un-picture it.
Ted : Good.
Barney : Oh, my god.
UNK: Mr Druthers : It's gone!
Ted : What? What's gone?
UNK: Mr Druthers : My baseball, signed three times by pete rose.
Ted : Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.
UNK: Mr Druthers : What do you think, ted,
UNK: Mr Druthers : It just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Somebody stole it.
Ted : Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Oh, who cares about the trees?
UNK: Mr Druthers : It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.
Ted : Inspiring as always, sir.
Ted : Lily?
UNK: Where'd she put those paints?
UNK: Hey. Hey.
Ted : Um, lily, question for you.
Ted : Why did I find mr. Druthers' baseball,
UNK: Mr Druthers : Signed three times by pete rose, in your desk drawer?
Lily : That's easy. I took it.
Ted : Why?
Lily : It's simple.
UNK: [FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers : I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef.
UNK: [FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers : I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you.
UNK: Mr Druthers : I didn't get you a birthday present.
UNK: Mr Druthers to a kid : What? You gonna cry?
UNK: Mr Druthers to a kid : Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry?
UNK: Mr Druthers to a kid : Hey, everybody, look!
UNK: Mr Druthers to a kid : The little crybaby's gonna cry!
UNK: Mr Druthers to a kid : I lost my ice cream!
Lily : Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one,
Lily : But the point is, he was mean.
Lily : And that's why I took away his ball.
Ted : What does his ball have to do with anything?
Lily : Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that.
Lily : When I was teaching
Lily : Kindergarten, whenever a kid was mean,
Lily : I would take away one of his toys.
Lily : The kid would be upset at first,
