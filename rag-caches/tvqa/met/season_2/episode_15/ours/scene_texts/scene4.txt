Lily : We might actually be able to sleep.
Robin : That's kind of annoying.
Lily : Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here
Lily : To turn it off any minute.
Lily : I don't think I can take this.
Lily : Every time it turns off, I think,
Lily : Oh, maybe it won't turn on again,
Lily : But then it does.
Lily : Why does it, robin?
Lily : Why does it keep turning on?
Robin : It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why...
Robin : Why don't we make a game out of it, okay?
Robin : Why don't we sing along?
UNK: âª Oh, oh, oh, oh!
UNK: âª Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Both : âª ooh...!
UNK: âª Ooh!
UNK: âª Mah, mah, mah, mah...
UNK: Oh, no.
Lily : If we get through this,
Lily : I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.
Robin : I just want to tell my parents
Robin : I love them one more time.
Man : Morning, ladies.
Lily : It's him. It's the car guy!
Robin : Get out of here!
UNK: Hey! Ow!
