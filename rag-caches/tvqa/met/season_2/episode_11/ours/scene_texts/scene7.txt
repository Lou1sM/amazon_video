Lily : In this exact model.
Lily : I never told you that. How did you know?
Marshall : It's our first christmas since we got back together.
Marshall : I want to get her something really special.
Marshall : So I'm getting her a jukebox.
Ted : Wow, that's a great gift.
Marshall : Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.
Ted : Oh, man, I know something you could get her
Ted : That would blow her mind.
Ted : Ready?
Ted : Eight years ago...
Lily : When I was a kid, all I wanted was an easy bake oven.

Kid : Uncle ted got us presents!
Stacy : That's okay, ted, we'll just give them to charity.
Charity : Yay!
Stacy : Uh, not you, charity.
Stacy : I meant the less fortunate.
Stacy : Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?
Ted : Uh, you know what, why don't you say it.
Ted : I really wouldn't know what to say.
Charity : Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.
Ted : That's a great idea, charity.
Ted : But, really, I don't know.
Ted : I mean how do you choose your favorite passage?
Ted : It's the bible;
Ted : There's so many... Great ones...
Ted : ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.

Robin : Totally.
Ted : But first, lily, I owe you an apology.
Lily : Oh, for the love of god, are you as sick of apologies as I am? Yes!
Lily : Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving? Yes.
Ted : And I promise, I will never ever call you a... You know, again.
