Lily : If one of my kindergartners used that kind of language?
Lily : I would be on the phone with their parents.
Ted : Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.

Clint : The native americans have this ritual...
Barney : This is a low moment for the barnacle.
Barney : I should be off playing laser tag right now,

Robin : You just look like a regular guy.
Lily : Exactly.
Barney : I'm a ted.
