UNK: Nice...
UNK: We win.
UNK: Oh, walk of shame,
UNK: Walk of game... what up?
UNK: Okay. Let's go one more.
UNK: I don't know. You know you want to.
UNK: All right, let's do it... I just got to call robin real quick.
UNK: Oh, so that's what it's gonna be like from now on?
UNK: No. Okay, okay. You call your old lady
UNK: And ask permission to have fun.
UNK: Me, I will be at the snack shack
UNK: Eating our victory onion rings han style.
UNK: Solo.
UNK: Hey, ted.
UNK: Hey, sweetie listen, I'm really sorry
UNK: But I'm gonna be pretty late, so don't wait up.
UNK: Oh, it's totally fine. You do what you got to do.
UNK: Thanks. You're the best. I love you.
UNK: I love you, too. Bye.
UNK: Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for holding.
UNK: Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel my subscription
UNK: To guns and ammo, that would be great.
UNK: No, it's a great magazine. Really great.
UNK: They've printed three of my letters.
UNK: It's just that my boyfriend is moving in
UNK: And he kind of doesn't approve of the whole gun thing.
UNK: A free hand grenade phone?
UNK: You know what?
UNK: Let me give you my work address.
UNK: I did it, baby!
UNK: I got beer.
UNK: I got food.
UNK: We don't need ted anymore.
UNK: I am the provider of this apartment now,
UNK: And I have provided!
UNK: "Provode"? Provided.
UNK: Anyway, I got us everything we need.
UNK: Could you toss me the toilet paper?
UNK: Be right back, baby. Sit tight.
UNK: Hey, I got to admit, um...
UNK: I didn't think I would, but, uh...
UNK: I had a really good time tonight.
UNK: You're a good friend, barney.
UNK: Hey, man, why don't you, uh...
UNK: Why don't you tell me where my truck is.
UNK: No, I don't think so.
UNK: Where's my truck?!
UNK: Do you know why
UNK: I haven't given you any of your possessions back yet?
UNK: Uh, because you're admiral jerk of the british royal douchery?
UNK: Because you don't want them back.
UNK: Oh. You could've left at any time tonight
UNK: But you didn't, ted. Why is that?
UNK: Because I didn't want to go back to robin's without my stuff.
UNK: False. You know what I think?
UNK: I think you spent one day with her
UNK: And it already sucked.
UNK: I think you didn't like being there,
UNK: She didn't like having you there
UNK: And you both realized
UNK: That you made a huge mistake.
UNK: And that's why
UNK: You spent your first night living with robin
UNK: Out playing laser tag with me.
UNK: And that's why three seconds ago
UNK: You didn't call it "my place"
UNK: Or "our place" or "home,"
UNK: You called it "robin's."
UNK: You know what?
UNK: You can keep my stuff.
UNK: Hey. Hey, did you get the truck back?
UNK: No. Why not? What happened?
UNK: Oh, he pissed me off so much, I left.
UNK: Anyway,
UNK: I just wanted to come back here, space out
UNK: And watch a movie.
UNK: Do you anything that wasn't made by john woo?
UNK: Why, do you?
UNK: You know, forget the movie.
UNK: I just want to sit.
UNK: What?
UNK: It's just I eat at that table.
UNK: Fine, I'll take my shoes off.
UNK: You know, why don't you just throw me down
UNK: In the storage space where you have room for me.
UNK: Ted, come on. No, you come on.
UNK: I had to jump through hoops all night for barney
UNK: And then it took me an hour to get home
UNK: Because his place is so far away from the bar.
UNK: Oh, my god. What?
UNK: I know where barney put my truck.
UNK: Mm.
UNK: Let's go back to my place.
UNK: I bet you my place is closer.
UNK: Here we are.
UNK: You live in the loading dock
UNK: Behind the bar?
UNK: I don't live here, baby. This is just my ride.
UNK: No, no, no, no. I'm not getting into any van,
UNK: I've seen silence of the lambs.
UNK: Oh, my god.
UNK: We're drinking champagne in the back of a moving van.
UNK: Why, yes, sara. Yes, we are.
UNK: Those other rockettes
UNK: Who called you slow are crazy.
