Ted : Kids, in the spring of 2007,
UNK: Everything was great between me and robin.
UNK: So we decided to try and make it even better.
UNK: We decided to move in together.
UNK: So, I can have the moving truck here by 8 : 00 am.
UNK: Does that sound good to everybody?
UNK: By the way, what are you guys doing with ted's room?
UNK: 'Cause if you need help with the rent, I'll take it.
UNK: Why would you want to live with us?
UNK: I don't call what you guys do "living."
Barney : Here's the deal,
UNK: I need a room closer to the bar.
UNK: It takes me
UNK: Exactly 23 minutes to get a girl
UNK: From the bar back to my apartment.
UNK: A lot can go wrong in 23 minutes.
