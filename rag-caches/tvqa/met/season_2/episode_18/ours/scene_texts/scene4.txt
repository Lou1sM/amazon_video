UNK: Wait, do you? Of course not.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Don't tell me how to live my life!
UNK: Ted, I can't let you do this.
UNK: Come on.
UNK: This is happening.
UNK: So instead of fighting it why, why don't you just help?
UNK: You want me to help you?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Okay, ted.
UNK: I'll help you.
UNK: Can't believe we actually got him to take a box down.
UNK: Mm. Maybe he's
UNK: Finally getting on board.
UNK: Where's the truck?
UNK: Where's barney?
UNK: Wait for it.
UNK: I can't believe this!
UNK: Everything I own in the world is in there.
UNK: Except for this box of pot lids.
UNK: And the sword.
UNK: I'm going to kill him.
UNK: I swear to god I'm going to kill him!
UNK: Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that.
UNK: For now.
UNK: Marshall, we live alone.
UNK: This is so great!
UNK: We can finally do all the things
UNK: We always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.
UNK: Oh, I know what I want to start with.
UNK: So, here we are, right?
UNK: Sitting around the apartment naked.
UNK: Awesome. Yep.
UNK: It's not as awesome as I thought it would be.
UNK: My butt itches.
UNK: I'm cold. I noticed.
UNK: Yeah, like you're one to talk, pointy.
UNK: Barney, I don't know if you got my other 47 messages,
UNK: But if my stuff isn't here within the hour
UNK: I'm calling the cops.
UNK: This is the last time I'm calling you.
UNK: Because my charger's in the back of the truck.
UNK: Don't worry, it's barney.
UNK: He'll bring the stuff back.
UNK: No, it's just...
UNK: I was really looking forward
UNK: To settling in, you know?
UNK: Maybe setting up my tv.
UNK: Watching a movie in bed.
UNK: What?
UNK: Do we really want a tv in the bedroom?
UNK: I thought we did.
UNK: I'm not sure that we do.
UNK: Well, where else would we put my tv?
UNK: We could just put it in our storage unit
UNK: In the basement.
UNK: But wouldn't we miss my tv?
UNK: Would we?
UNK: Yes, we would.
UNK: We've had that tv for a long time
UNK: And we would feel more at home
UNK: If it were setup in our bedroom.
UNK: We need wine, don't we?
UNK: Yes, we do.
UNK: Should we, um, move this to the bedroom?
UNK: Why?
UNK: Ted doesn't live here anymore.
UNK: We can do it wherever we want.
UNK: You know what else? Hmm?
UNK: We don't have to be quiet anymore.
UNK: We can be as loud as we want.
UNK: Okay, I think we need
UNK: To lay down some ground rules.
UNK: Just because we can be loud doesn't mean we have to be loud.
UNK: And although it might turn you on,
UNK: You screaming, "I'm the best," doesn't do much for me.
UNK: Well, it's a lot better than yelling,
UNK: "ted's not here," over and over again.
UNK: Well, at least what I said is true.
UNK: Well, that was unnecessary.
UNK: Well, since I only have one box
UNK: I figure I might as well unpack it.
UNK: Mm, where do you think we should put it?
UNK: Well, unless you have a separate pot lid room,
UNK: I was thinking the cupboard.
UNK: What?
UNK: Uh, the thing is my kitchen is kind of small.
UNK: And, um, I already have a bunch of pot lids
UNK: And mine come with pots, so...
UNK: You're saying there's no way to make room
UNK: For the single box of stuff I try to move into our place?
UNK: Well, why don't you just take it down to the...
UNK: Do not say storage space.
UNK: I was going to say dumpster.
UNK: Damn it, robin, this is all I have left
UNK: In the world... eight pot lids and a sword.
UNK: Yeah, about the sword.
UNK: Hello.
