UNK: Oh, my god. I knew it.
UNK: You're kidnapping me. Help!
UNK: No, no, no, no. Help!
UNK: I can explain.
UNK: Hello?
UNK: Enjoying the ride?
UNK: Ted? Ted, you let us out of here.
UNK: You let us out of here this instant!
UNK: This isn't ted.
UNK: But I hear that guy's awesome.
UNK: So I took sara home
UNK: And I took barney to a bar near his apartment.
UNK: Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him.
UNK: That poor girl must've been so confused. Yeah.
UNK: Well, at least barney learned a valuable lesson.
UNK: You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a rockette.
UNK: So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, I guess we should.
UNK: Lily...
UNK: Deep within the amazonian rainforest,
UNK: There is a type of tree that only grows
UNK: Around the body of an existing tree.
UNK: It cannot survive without this tree.
UNK: It is supported... By this tree.
UNK: Lily, we are that tree.
UNK: The inside tree or the outside tree?
UNK: The outside tree.
UNK: Shouldn't there be three trees?
UNK: You and I are one tree. Okay, look, lily,
UNK: The point is that we grew around ted
UNK: And without him, we're slowly dying.
UNK: What do we do?
UNK: I think we can marry each other.
UNK: But we also have to marry ted.
UNK: I'll tell you right now, my dad
UNK: Is not gonna pay for that wedding.
UNK: Ted! What are you doing here?
UNK: Robin and I aren't gonna move in together after all.
UNK: What happened?
UNK: I thought we decided we were ready? I know.
UNK: How did we come to that again?
UNK: I don't remember.
UNK: We were fighting?
UNK: It's all so blurry. Yeah.
UNK: The "let's move in together" sex
UNK: Was pretty amazing. I know.
UNK: I did that thing with no hands
UNK: I normally need both to do. Mm-hmm.
UNK: You know...
UNK: I'm really happy with you.
UNK: I really happy with you. The way things are.
UNK: Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't mess with that.
UNK: I don't know that we should.
UNK: Hey...
UNK: I hear the "let's not move in together" sex
UNK: Is pretty incredible.
UNK: Let's go back to my place.
UNK: Mm...
UNK: Thank you. You're welcome.
UNK: No, thank you. You'll be very happy.
UNK: Uh, look, I-I know you guys are really excited
UNK: About having the place to yourself.
UNK: Until after the wedding, I mean, if it's not
UNK: Too much of an imposition...
UNK: Um... God, this feels so right.
UNK: Mm... Never leave us again.
UNK: Guys, robin's down in the truck and there's actually
UNK: A lot of boxes, so maybe we should...
UNK: Shh...
UNK: Do we have time for this?
UNK: Ladies and gentlemen,
UNK: I have in my hand a copy of tonight's top ten list.
UNK: The category : Top ten things I would've called my truck...
UNK: It was never your truck.
UNK: If ted hadn't been a jerk
UNK: And given it back.
UNK: It was a rental.
UNK: Number ten,
UNK: "the winne-bango."
UNK: Number nine, "the pick-up truck."
UNK: Number eight, "the ford explore her."
