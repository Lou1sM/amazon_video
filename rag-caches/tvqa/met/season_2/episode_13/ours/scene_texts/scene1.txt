Ted : I... I can't believe
Ted : You knocked over my model.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Well, it's just... It's not exactly new is it... columns?
UNK: Mr Druthers : I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea... ceilings?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Floors?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Windows?
Ted : I know what you're thinking :
UNK: Who's this jerk?
UNK: Well, this jerk was hammond druthers,
UNK: A legend in the architecture community.
UNK: Very big in the '80s.
UNK: He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had.
UNK: Then I designed the spokane national bank building.
UNK: And suddenly...
UNK: I was his boss.
UNK: And he didn't like it. Stairs?
UNK: Ted voix off : And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either.
UNK: Ted voix off : See, before, when I was just another employee,
UNK: Ted voix off : I was happy, carefree.
UNK: Ted voix off : The guy who hung out in the break room
UNK: Ted voix off : Making fun of the boss.
Ted : Did you see what he was wearing today?
Ted : It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.
UNK: Co-worker : Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers,
UNK: Co-worker : I get hay fever just looking at it.
UNK: Ted voix off : But suddenly I was a different guy.
Ted : Hey, guys.
Ted : What's so funny?
UNK: Co-worker : Nothing.
UNK: Co-worker : Um... Nice shirt.
Ted : Thanks.
UNK: Ted voix off : The hours were insane.
UNK: Ted voix off : I was always working even when I wasn't at work.
Ted : Oh, robin...
Ted : I just had a great idea.
Robin : Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.
UNK: Ted voix off : Before, I used to be this guy.
Ted : Dude, of course you should take the day off
Ted : For the foo fighters concert.
Ted : Just say you're sick.
UNK: Ted voix off : But now...
UNK: Ted voix off : I was this guy.
Ted : Sick, huh?
Ted : Unbutton your shirt.
Ted : Hmm... "foo fighters."
Ted : Get back to work.
UNK: Ted voix off : But still, the worst part was druthers.
Ted : Well, I was thinking...
UNK: Mr Druthers : Ceilings?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Oops.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Said that already.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas.
UNK: Mr Druthers : I'm kidding, of course.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Another hole in one, boss.
Robin : Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.
Ted : Why would you say that?
Robin : Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away
Robin : With saying things like that.
Barney : I have found that to be true.
Marshall : It's a blessing and a curse really.
Lily : Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.
Marshall : Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,
Marshall : Who's the boss?
Ted : Tony.
UNK: Angela. Mona.
Robin : Mona?
Barney : Watch it more closely.
Barney : Rock your world.
Robin : So, what are you gonna do?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Well...
Ted : It's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss.
Ted : So, I went to talk to the managing partner.
MP : Fire him.
Ted : Well, sir, I was thinking
Ted : He could just be put on a different project.
MP : Fire him.
MP : He's an arrogant, washed-up,
MP : Pain in the ass.
MP : In fact,
MP : Fire everyone on that project.
MP : Druthers, mosby,
MP : The whole lot of them.
Ted : Mosby, sir?
Ted : I, I... I hear mosby's doing some great work.
MP : Fine, mosby can stay.
MP : But tell him he's on thin ice.
MP : Come here.
MP : I like you, crosby.
Barney : You mind if I charge my phone?
Ted : Knock yourself out.
Robin : Well, ted, if you do fire druthers,
Robin : The key is timing.
Robin : Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?
UNK: Vicki, um...
UNK: I'm so sorry about this,
UNK: But there's been some budget cuts and, um,
UNK: We have to let you go.
UNK: I mean, after tonight.
UNK: I still need my makeup for the broadcast.
UNK: Ted voix off : So...
