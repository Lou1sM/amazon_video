Lily : No, he's actually a little husky... Oh,
Marshall : He's just huggable!
Marshall : And complicated...
Marshall : And a little bit of a jerk.
Marshall : Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.
Lily : Okay, just forget it.

Marshall : I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.
Lily : Well, then you'll have to do it.
Marshall : Are you kidding me?
