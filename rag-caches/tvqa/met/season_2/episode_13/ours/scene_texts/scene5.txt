Marshall : We're going to loch ness!
Lily : Yeah!
Ted : That cabby would not shut up.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Yeah, we should call him a gabby.
Ted : I think it, you say it.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Hey, uh...
UNK: Mr Druthers : Thanks for putting me up last night, buddy.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Give 'em hell.
Ted : Morning, team.
Ted : So, I have given it some thought,
Ted : And I say we revisit columns.
UNK: Oh, god, not this again.
UNK: Ted, a man in a toga
UNK: Just arrived and delivered a parchment.
UNK: Let me read it :
UNK: Oh! It's from ancient greece.
UNK: They want their basic architectural elements back.
UNK: Oh, geez.
Ted : What?
UNK: Mr Druthers : You didn't hear me?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Toga, parchment...
Ted : Can I see you for one second?
UNK: Mr Druthers : Ooh, I'm in trouble now.
Ted : What are you doing?
Ted : I thought we were friends.
Ted : You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal.
Ted : I tossed you more toilet paper.
UNK: We ar friends.
UNK: Mr Druthers : But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.
Ted : What? I don't believe this!
Ted : You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes!
UNK: And my girlfriend's...
UNK: Sneakers... man, you have weirdly small feet.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Ted, I hope that you're not going to let
UNK: Mr Druthers : Our professional woes interfere with our friendship,
UNK: Mr Druthers : Because I really kind of need you right now.
Lily : Okay, let's get this over with.
Barney : Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in.
Barney : This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art.
Barney : I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.
Marshall : Thank you.
Barney : I meant me.
Barney : Now, I like how you captured marshall's essence.
Barney : Goofy and unburdened, with wit.
Barney : But me, I want something more regal.
Barney : Something my progeny could look at and say,
Barney : "there's stands barnabus stinson."
Barney : He was wise...
Barney : And strong.
Lily : I don't think your sword will fit.
Barney : I get that a lot.
Ted : And so, as lily began painting,
UNK: Ted voix off : Marshall thought about the $5,000
UNK: And what his fiancÃ©e was doing to earn it.
Marshall : This isn't right.
Marshall : This isn't right at all.
UNK: Ted voix off : Finally, he could take it no more.
Lily : Hold still.
Lily : Hold still.
Lily : Hold still!
Barney : Paint faster!
Lily : Okay, I guess it's time.
Lily : Drop your shorts.
UNK: Co-worker : Yeah.
Barney : Wait, wait!
Barney : That wasn't enough buildup.
UNK: Mr Druthers : I need...
UNK: Uh... Ah!
Barney : In a world without justice, one man...
UNK: Oh, just drop them! All right.
Robin : Oh!
Marshall : No! No, this is not right!
UNK: We had a deal! Well, I'm going back on the deal.
UNK: Barney, get out! You...!
Marshall : It's over!
Marshall : Lily, I can't let you go through with this!
UNK: : I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand.
Marshall : It's just not right!
Marshall : It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.
UNK: I can't let the woman I love compromise her values for money!
UNK: I totally think we can get some more money out of him.
UNK: I'm never letting my fiancÃ©e, ever...!
UNK: Oh, you're still here?
Barney : Before you say anything,
Barney : I'll give you an extra five grand. We accept.
Barney : You people are so easy to control.
Barney : Dance for me, puppets, dance.
Ted : And that's how uncle barney
UNK: Ted voix off : Paid for lily and marshall's honeymoon.
UNK: Mr Druthers : Come on, ted, listen, why don't we get back
UNK: Mr Druthers : And finish drawing the plans for a building
UNK: Mr Druthers : Which, in my opinion, is never going to get built,
UNK: Mr Druthers : So you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.
Ted : No.
Ted : Look, hammond,
