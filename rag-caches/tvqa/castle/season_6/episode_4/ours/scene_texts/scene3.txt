Emma : Okay, it's you.
Castle : So let me ask you a few questions...
Emma : No, no, no, no, no, no. Not on the phone.
Emma : The cops are listening.
UNK: So?
Emma : So, I don't trust them, okay?
Emma : Just come inside the dental office and we can talk here.
UNK: - You've gotta be kidding. - Hey!
Emma : Shut up!
Castle : Look, Emma...
Emma : We need to speak face to face. Do you hear me?
Emma : It is the only way.
Castle : Okay, but only if you send out Suki and her mother. Deal?
UNK: Deal. Be outside in five minutes.
UNK: SIGHING Oh, God. Castle, what the hell were you thinking?
Castle : I have no idea. Honestly, I didn't think she would take the deal.
UNK: But, look, hey, she's a fan. Okay? I know my fans. She won't hurt me.
Roman : You don't know that.
Castle : I'm not blind to the risks,
Castle : but I already got her to give up a little girl and her mother.
Castle : I can reach her.
UNK: Right? Maybe even get her to surrender?
Castle : So let me go in.
Roman : The goal is to get in and get out. You understand?
Roman : Get her demands, check the status of the hostages
Roman : and make mental notes of where everyone is.
Roman : That'll help us if we have to breach. You with me so far?
Castle : Demands, status, mental notes. Got it.
Roman : And if anything, and I mean anything, seems off,
UNK: tell Emma you have to call us.
Roman : Tell her it's to make sure that we're not gonna do anything stupid.
Castle : - Okay? - Okay.
UNK: So we're gonna need a code word that tells us that you need help.
Roman : What's your favorite food?
Castle : Oh. Um...
Castle : Are we talking everyday food or fine dining?
Castle : If desserts are included, there's...
UNK: Cheeseburgers. He loves cheeseburgers.
Castle : I do enjoy a good cheeseburger.
Roman : Okay. Anything goes wrong,
Roman : call, mention cheeseburgers, and we'll come running.
Roman : Good luck in there.
Castle : Thank you.
UNK: Cheeseburger.
UNK: Listen,
Beckett : I'm kind of looking forward to spending the rest of my life with you,
UNK: so don't do anything stupid in there, okay?
Castle : Hey, don't worry. I think I already hit my stupid quota for the day.
UNK: DOOR CLOSES
Emma : My God. It really is you.
Castle : So we have a deal?
EMMA : Come on. Come on!
Emma : Let's go. Come in.
UNK: DOOR LOCKS
CASTLE : How you guys doing?
UNK: How the hell you think we're doing?
UNK: Hey! I told you to shut up!
Castle : Okay. Emma, Emma, easy.
Castle : I'm here now, all right? So let's talk.
UNK: You wanna tell me your demands?
UNK: What do you mean, "demands"?
UNK: Uh, money, transportation out of here...
Emma : No, no, I don't want any of that.
Castle : Okay. Then what do you want?
UNK: You. I just want you.
Castle : You want me?
