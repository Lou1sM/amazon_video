Beckett : Apparently she got drunk,
Beckett : lured him into their basement and then stabbed him with a knife.
Castle : Well, that's a coincidence.
Beckett : Also known as an M.O.
Beckett : Castle, it's exactly what she did to Angelo.
Beckett : She's unstable. You need to get out of there. Now.
UNK: GUN COCKS
Emma : Don't say another word. Hang up.
UNK: She told you about Billy Koss, didn't she?
Castle : - Look, Emma... - Back up!
Emma : I am not a murderer.
Castle : Says the lady pointing a gun at me.
Emma : You weren't supposed to find out about Billy Koss.
Roman : I mean, what is the point of a sealed record
Emma : when the cops can open it whenever they feel like it?
Castle : I'm sure they got a subpoena first.
UNK: And I'm sure they all had a laugh off all the adjectives describing me, right?
Emma : Manic. Bipolar. Violent. Murderer.
UNK: Well, not to be a stickler, but "murderer" isn't an adjective.
Emma : I'm not an idiot.
UNK: Sorry. I just get sarcastic when I'm nervous.
Emma : That's not what I was talking about.
UNK: Look, I knew what you were going to think.
Emma : Two deaths, happening the exact same way.
Emma : That's why I didn't tell you.
UNK: But I am innocent. I didn't kill Angelo. I didn't!
UNK: If that's true, Emma, and you want me to help you,
Castle : you have to tell me everything.
UNK: EXHALES
Emma : When I was 16, I was sent to this foster home.
Emma : Twin orphans lived there. The Koss brothers.
Emma : Warren and Billy.
Castle : What happened?
Emma : Those two bullied me for weeks.
UNK: The foster parents were in it for the money, so they didn't care.
