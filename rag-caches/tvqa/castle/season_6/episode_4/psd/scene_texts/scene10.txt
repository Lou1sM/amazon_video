UNK: Sue Williams : Excuse me?
UNK: And then, Sue, you squirt out a few tears. Beg Emma to help him,
Mickey : when she does, boom, I take her out, we end this,
Mickey : then we meet at the bar around the corner and the first round's on me.
Kogan : Are you out of your mind?
Sue : That is the dumbest plan ever.
UNK: Fine. I'll do it by myself.
UNK: KNOCK ON DOOR
Castle : It's Castle.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: - And I brought donuts. - Hey.
UNK: Um, gluten-free?
UNK: Dude, they're donuts. Either you're in or you're out.
UNK: EMMA SIGHS
Emma : You find out anything?
Castle : Emma, what do you know about Angelo's trips to Scarsdale?
Emma : Nothing. He wouldn't tell me.
Castle : Is it possible he was there casing a house for a burglary?
UNK: What?
Emma : No. That's ridiculous.
UNK: Do the initials "S.H." Mean anything to you?
Castle : Could someone from Angelo's criminal past have come back?
UNK: Wait. Look, that was all petty stuff when he was a kid. That's all.
UNK: Yes, but he wasn't a kid anymore. The stakes were higher.
Castle : He was out of work. He wanted to surprise you on your birthday.
Castle : Maybe propose.
Castle : What if he got into trouble trying to make that happen?
Esposito : Yo, Beckett. Where's Castle?
Ryan : He's not in there, is he?
UNK: Why?
Esposito : We found something. Something about Emma.
Castle : Emma, let these people go.
Castle : It worked. You got my attention. There's hope now.
UNK: SNIFFLING
UNK: No. Uh-uh. Not until my name is cleared. No.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGING
Castle : - It's Beckett, I'm... - Go.
Castle : Hey, Beckett.
Beckett : Do not react to what I'm about to tell you.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : Emma has been playing you this whole time.
Castle : Interesting. Can you elaborate?
Beckett : Angelo is not her first victim. She's done this before.
Beckett : She has a sealed juvie record under her original name, Emma Jones.
UNK: Uh-huh.
Beckett : When she was 16, she killed her foster brother, Billy Koss.
