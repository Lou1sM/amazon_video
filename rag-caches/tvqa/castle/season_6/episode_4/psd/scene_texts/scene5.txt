Esposito : And here is an empty bottle of Scotch.
Esposito : Ladies and gentlemen, this is a booty call gone wrong.
BECKETT : None of this makes any sense.
Beckett : I mean, if she actually killed him,
Beckett : why isn't she asking for a flight out of the country?
Beckett : Why is she insisting that she's innocent?
UNK: Maybe because she's crazy.
UNK: I found Emma's prescriptions. Clonazepam and aripiprazole.
UNK: Lanie, aren't those antipsychotics?
Roman : One is, the other one's for mood disorders.
Lanie : Hey, you know, if Emma stopped taking her meds,
UNK: she could've had a psychotic break.
Beckett : Which means she wouldn't remember what she did.
Beckett : We have to warn Castle.
Esposito : Beckett, relax. He's just on the phone with the woman.
Beckett : No, he went in.
UNK: Uh-huh.
Castle : Okay, let me call you back.
Emma : Did Detective Beckett find anything?
Castle : Emma, I can't help you if you're not honest with me.
Emma : But I have been honest.
Castle : You said everything between you and Angelo was all right.
Emma : Yeah, it was.
Castle : So you didn't suspect him of cheating?
