GATES : If that is true,
Gates : then why did you pay to unseal Emma's juvenile record?
Stokes : Where are you getting this?
Beckett : From your lawyer, Mr. Stokes.
Stokes : What lawyer?
Gates : Okay, this is borderline police harassment.
Vance : If you continue to hold me here against my will, you either need to...
Esposito : Just wait before you get all lawyer-y. We already know everything.
Ryan : Starting with you being Aaron Stokes' son-in-law.

Ryan : So, when your in-laws were out of town,
Ryan : you were staying in their Scarsdale house.
UNK: So, when Angelo went to go look for Mr. Stokes, he met you instead.
Ryan : That's when he told you the story about Mr. Stokes' long-lost daughter, Emma.
UNK: STUTTERING Look,

Vance : But I've never seen this guy before in my life.
