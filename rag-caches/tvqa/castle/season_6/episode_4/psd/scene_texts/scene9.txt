Beckett : Yeah, but what was Angelo up to?
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGING
UNK: Beckett.
Sully : Hey, it's Sully.
Sully : There was nothing of interest at Angelo's apartment,
Sully : but his car is a whole other matter.
UNK: Get this. Angelo had a duffel bag filled with tools of the burglar variety,
Sully : a floor plan to what looks like a house,
Sully : and a manual for a RAMCO 4700 alarm system.
Sully : I don't think he was installing home security systems.
Beckett : Angelo was out of work.
Beckett : Do you think he went back to committing B and E's?
Castle : I only know one person with the answer to that question.
UNK: SOFTLY Okay, here's the plan.
Mickey : Doc, act like you're having a seizure.
