Beckett : I cannot believe that the FBI fired me.
Beckett : And I can't get my job back at the NYPD
Beckett : because of the Commissioner's stupid hiring freeze.
Beckett : I might as well just apply to become a mall cop.
Castle : Ooh. You would look great on a Segway.
Castle : You know, Beckett, you don't have to decide right away.
Beckett : Come on, Castle. What are you saying? What am I gonna do?
Beckett : Just sleep in every morning and screw around till the phone rings?
Beckett : - What kind of life is that? - Mine.
UNK: Sorry.
Castle : I just mean that you're with me now, you don't have to work.
Beckett : I don't need to work?
Beckett : Does that mean you're my sugar daddy?
UNK: Oh. Hold on, that didn't come out the...
UNK: Actually, I'm still sleep-talking.
Castle : I can't really be held responsible for whatever I say.
Pi : Wow, even when you're fighting, you two are super cute.
UNK: SIGHS Pi.
Pi : Morning, Mr. C, Mrs. C-to-be.
Pi : Hey, uh, do you mind if I borrow a razor?
Pi : Alexis gets all fired up when I shave with the one she uses for her legs.
UNK: - Under the sink. - Under the sink. Yep. Cool.
Beckett : - Why is he still sleeping on your couch? - I don't know.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : - Good morning, darlings. - Doesn't anyone knock?
Martha : Door was open. Don't be an old maid.
Martha : Nothing going on here that I haven't seen and done before. LAUGHS
Castle : So, how can I help you, Mother?
Martha : As you know, my studio is being painted,
Martha : so I am having my stage combat class
UNK: in the living room in, whoo-hoo, 15 minutes.
Martha : So, please, feel free to join.
Pi : - Triple blade razors! Nice, Mr. C! - TELEPHONE RINGING
UNK: You know what? I think I'm gonna sleep in my own place tonight.
Castle : Think I might join you.
UNK: Alexis Castle : - What is this, a house meeting? - No!
Alexis : - Captain Gates is on the phone. - Oh!
UNK: She's asking for you, Dad.
UNK: Hello?
GATES : Thanks for coming, Mr. Castle. You too, Beckett.
Gates : Again, I'm sorry your reinstatement didn't work out.
Beckett : Yeah. Thanks.
UNK: So, what have we got?
UNK: Angelo VÃ¡zquez, stabbed to death in his girlfriend's apartment.
UNK: And this is Mr. VÃ¡zquez.
Castle : And you are calling on my expertise to unmask the killer.
Gates : No. Actually, we've already ID'd the suspect.
Gates : She's the victim's girlfriend, Emma Riggs.
Beckett : How do you know it's her?
Gates : Because she fled from the scene
Gates : and took hostages in a dental office up the street.
UNK: Oh, okay. So this involves me how?
Gates : Hostage negotiators have been trying to talk to Emma,
Gates : but she's demanding to speak to only you, Mr. Castle.
Castle : Me? Why me?
Gates : We were hoping you could tell us.
Gates : Is she familiar to you?
UNK: Uh... I've never seen her before. What do we know about her?
Gates : Not much so far. Emma Riggs, 31, waitress, no record.
Gates : At least until now.
UNK: Sergeant?
Gates : This is Sergeant Roman from the Hostage Negotiating Team.
UNK: - Richard Castle and Kate Beckett. - CELL PHONE RINGING
UNK: Uh... Ooh. Deputy Chief. Excuse me.
UNK: Sergeant Roman : Mr. Castle, are you open to talking to Emma over the phone?
Castle : Yeah, of course. Anything I can do to help.
Beckett : So, what's the situation inside?
UNK: It's not ideal for our purposes.
Roman : The windows in the office are covered,
Roman : and there's only one door leading in or out.
Beckett : Can't you just drill in fiber optics?
Roman : Cement's too thick.
Roman : But we have ascertained that she's taken five hostages.
Roman : The dentist, Dr. Abe Kogan,
Roman : his receptionist, Sue Williams,
Roman : patient, Mickey Gerhardt,
Roman : and Suki Chung, who's nine years old,
Roman : and Suki's mother, Lisa.
UNK: There's a 9-year-old in there?
UNK: But what if I say the wrong thing?
Roman : I'll be with you the whole time.
Roman : We'll make contact, see how everyone's doing,
Roman : take Emma's temperature, find out what she wants.
UNK: And then we'll put a plan together. All you have to do is talk.
Beckett : Well, if there's one thing you excel at, Castle, it's talking.
Roman : You ready?
Castle : No. But let's do this anyway.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGING
UNK: Hello?
Castle : Hello, Emma, this is Richard Castle.
Castle : I heard you wanted to speak with me.
Emma : How do I know it's really you?
UNK: Well, if you care to step outside, I'd be happy to show you my driver's license.
UNK: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
UNK: - MOUTHING - Okay, you say you're Richard Castle?
UNK: You're gonna have to prove it. All right?
UNK: In the Nikki Heat series, what's Rook and Nikki's wine of choice?
UNK: Sancerre.
UNK: In Deadly Heat, what's Douglas Sandmann's nickname?
Castle : Bedbug Doug.
UNK: In Storm Rising, what's Pierre Dubois' last words?
UNK: SNAPS FINGER Ah! Trick question.
Castle : Pierre was a Trappist monk.
Castle : He took a vow of silence. He never spoke.
Castle : Boom! Believe it's me now, Emma?
UNK: Because I can play Richard Castle trivia with you all day. I will crush you.
Emma : Okay, it's you.
Castle : So let me ask you a few questions...
Emma : No, no, no, no, no, no. Not on the phone.
Emma : The cops are listening.
UNK: So?
Emma : So, I don't trust them, okay?
Emma : Just come inside the dental office and we can talk here.
UNK: - You've gotta be kidding. - Hey!
Emma : Shut up!
Castle : Look, Emma...
Emma : We need to speak face to face. Do you hear me?
Emma : It is the only way.
Castle : Okay, but only if you send out Suki and her mother. Deal?
UNK: Deal. Be outside in five minutes.
UNK: SIGHING Oh, God. Castle, what the hell were you thinking?
Castle : I have no idea. Honestly, I didn't think she would take the deal.
UNK: But, look, hey, she's a fan. Okay? I know my fans. She won't hurt me.
Roman : You don't know that.
Castle : I'm not blind to the risks,
Castle : but I already got her to give up a little girl and her mother.
Castle : I can reach her.
UNK: Right? Maybe even get her to surrender?
Castle : So let me go in.
Roman : The goal is to get in and get out. You understand?
Roman : Get her demands, check the status of the hostages
Roman : and make mental notes of where everyone is.
Roman : That'll help us if we have to breach. You with me so far?
Castle : Demands, status, mental notes. Got it.
Roman : And if anything, and I mean anything, seems off,
UNK: tell Emma you have to call us.
Roman : Tell her it's to make sure that we're not gonna do anything stupid.
Castle : - Okay? - Okay.
UNK: So we're gonna need a code word that tells us that you need help.
Roman : What's your favorite food?
Castle : Oh. Um...
Castle : Are we talking everyday food or fine dining?
Castle : If desserts are included, there's...
UNK: Cheeseburgers. He loves cheeseburgers.
Castle : I do enjoy a good cheeseburger.
Roman : Okay. Anything goes wrong,
Roman : call, mention cheeseburgers, and we'll come running.
Roman : Good luck in there.
Castle : Thank you.
UNK: Cheeseburger.
UNK: Listen,
Beckett : I'm kind of looking forward to spending the rest of my life with you,
UNK: so don't do anything stupid in there, okay?
Castle : Hey, don't worry. I think I already hit my stupid quota for the day.
UNK: DOOR CLOSES
Emma : My God. It really is you.
Castle : So we have a deal?
EMMA : Come on. Come on!
Emma : Let's go. Come in.
UNK: DOOR LOCKS
CASTLE : How you guys doing?
UNK: How the hell you think we're doing?
UNK: Hey! I told you to shut up!
Castle : Okay. Emma, Emma, easy.
Castle : I'm here now, all right? So let's talk.
UNK: You wanna tell me your demands?
UNK: What do you mean, "demands"?
UNK: Uh, money, transportation out of here...
Emma : No, no, I don't want any of that.
Castle : Okay. Then what do you want?
UNK: You. I just want you.
Castle : You want me?
UNK: SOBBING My boyfriend is dead.
Emma : And I know what it looks like. I do. I know it looks like I killed him.
Emma : - But I didn't kill him! I didn't... - Uh-huh.
Emma : Shut up!
Castle : Emma, please.
Castle : Stay calm.
Emma : I know what you're capable of, Richard Castle.
Emma : How you solve murders.
Emma : You want demands? Okay.
