UNK: Look who was right there when Claire stepped out of that limo?
BECKETT : Same guy.
UNK: Police!
UNK: NYPD!
Esposito : - Kitchen, clear. - Bedroom, clear.
RYAN : Hey, closet.
UNK: Ahh!
UNK: GRUNTING
UNK: Let go of me!
UNK: CONTINUES GRUNTING
UNK: - Let go of me! - Give me your arm!
UNK: I didn't do anything!
Ryan : - You okay? - Yeah.
Esposito : I think we got our guy.
UNK: Ken Castor : No, listen, you don't understand.
ESPOSITO : The hell we don't.
Esposito : We know that you took those pictures, Ken.
Beckett : We know that you were in her apartment.
Ken : Because she needed me.
Beckett : Needed you?
Ken : I was protecting her.
Ken : I was watching over her and she needed that.
UNK: Right, 'cause she didn't have people watching her and staring at her already.
Ken : They didn't care. Not like me.
Ken : They don't understand her.
Ken : I mean, they drove her to it, you know?
Ken : That's why I sent her the pictures.
Ken : Because she needed to know that someone cared.
Ken : She needed to know that someone was watching.
Beckett : Is that what you were doing outside of her apartment last night?
UNK: Watching?
UNK: VOICE TREMBLING I should've saved her.
