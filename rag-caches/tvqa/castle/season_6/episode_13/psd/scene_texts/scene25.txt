Mandy : You set up that photo?
Mandy : You did this to me? Why would you do that?
UNK: Why do you wanna ruin my life?
Marilyn : It was Zach who was ruining your life. I was saving you.
Mandy : Wait a minute. Wait, you did this to break me up with Zach?
Mandy : He was the best thing that ever happened to me!
UNK: He was gonna take me away from all of this.
Marilyn : That's right, away from everything we'd worked for.
Marilyn : Your tour, your career, he was gonna cost you millions.
Mandy : You mean cost you millions.
Marilyn : And for what?
Mandy : A chance to be normal?
Marilyn : SCOFFS Normal.
UNK: You're special. Zach didn't understand that.
Marilyn : And neither did Claire.
Mandy : So you killed her?
UNK: She was gonna tell you what I'd done.
UNK: She was gonna make you hate me.
Marilyn : I couldn't let her drive a wedge between us. I couldn't.
