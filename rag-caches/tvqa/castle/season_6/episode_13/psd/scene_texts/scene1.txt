UNK: Hey, Mr. C! Hope I didn't wake ya.
UNK: No.
Pi : I was just on my way to work,
Pi : thought I would pick up my letter of recommendation.
Castle : Right. For your grant application.
Pi : Really appreciate you doing it.
Castle : I know I told Alexis I was finished, but I haven't really quite, um...
Castle : I'm still tweaking it. I'm getting it just right.
Pi : You're a perfectionist, like me. Well, take your time.
UNK: Not too much time. Deadline's tonight.
Castle : I'll have it done by lunch.
UNK: Thanks, Mr. C! You're the best!
Castle : I know.
Doorman : - Hi! - Hi, Pi.
UNK: Bye.
Beckett : You haven't written a word, have you?
Castle : No. But in my defense, what am I supposed to write? It's Pi.
Beckett : - So why'd you offer? - I didn't.
UNK: Alexis asked and I can't say no.
