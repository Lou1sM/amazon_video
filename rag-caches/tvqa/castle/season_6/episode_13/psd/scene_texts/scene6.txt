Gates : pretending to be Mandy when she was killed,
Gates : then we need to consider the very real possibility that Mandy Sutton
Gates : was our killer's intended target,
Gates : and that they might be looking to finish the job.
Castle : They may already have, which is why we can't find her.
UNK: Found her! She's checked into the Wessex Hotel under one of her aliases.
Kelly : But she's not answering her room phone
Kelly : and she's not responding to knocks on the door.
UNK: BEEPS
UNK: Castle.
Beckett : That's not blood. It's wine.
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: MOANS
UNK: WEAKLY Closing time already?
Mandy : Who are you?
Mandy : What do you mean, I'm dead?
Beckett : Claire Samuels was killed last night and the world thinks that that was you.
UNK: Who?
Castle : Claire Samuels. She's your decoy.
UNK: The girl we dress to look like you to confuse the paparazzi.
