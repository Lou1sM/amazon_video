Ken : I mean, I never saw her go back, you know?
Esposito : What about the motorcycle? Color? Trim?
Ken : I wrote that down. It was red. Um...
UNK: Uh... STAMMERING
Ken : It was a red Ducati 800 SuperSport.
Ken : It had gold wheels and it had a flame decal on the body.
Ryan : What do you think?
UNK: He's a nut job. But he's probably not our killer.
Ryan : Yeah, how's that?
Beckett : Unlike the paparazzi, he knew Claire was getting out of the limo.
Beckett : So he can tell them apart.
UNK: And since he's obsessed with Mandy,
Esposito : there would be no reason for him to go after Claire.
Beckett : We'll hold him.
Beckett : But if he's not our killer, he's probably our best witness.
UNK: Why don't we get a hold of traffic cam footage in the area.
Beckett : Let's see if we can get a plate on that Ducati.
UNK: Gold wheels, a flame decal on the body. It's got to be a custom job.
Ryan : Yeah, I'll check with bike shops in the area
Ryan : and see if I can find the place that did that work.
Beckett : Where's Castle?
Ryan : He's having dinner with his other ex-wife.
Ryan : Something about not wanting her to feel left out.
UNK: CHUCKLES Good one.
Ryan : He's holed up in the break room writing that letter for Alexis' boyfriend.
Beckett : Thank you.
ALEXIS : Will you stop worrying?
Alexis : He'll have lots of great things to say about you.
Alexis : - I guarantee it. - I don't know.
Pi : I'm not exactly Mr. C's favorite person.
UNK: And he is taking an awfully long time.
Alexis : He does have other things to do, you know.
Pi : No, Al, that's not what I meant.
UNK: Maybe he's done by now.
UNK: He said he'd text me when it was ready. Let's see.
UNK: - That's weird, my phone's off. - PHONE CLICKS
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGTONE PLAYING
UNK: That's not my ring. Hello?
Mandy : You have my phone.
Alexis : Mandy? Hi! Uh...
Alexis : Yeah, I just realized. It's funny.
UNK: We must've switched. CHUCKLES
