UNK: Jesse Jones : she was looking for a lot more than a tattoo.
UNK: Jesse Jones : I was happy to provide.
Beckett : So I read online that the two of you were stormy, and it didn't end well.
Beckett : You trashed her apartment, made some pretty serious threats.
Jesse : Water under the bridge.
Beckett : Until two nights ago, when you guys hooked up. How'd that happen?
Jesse : I was at a bar.
Jesse : She came in, threw herself at me like old times, and I obliged.
Jesse : That was the last time I saw her.
Beckett : How'd you take it when right after that photo of you two appeared,
UNK: she told Celebgazer that you were "human trash"
UNK: and that that night was "the biggest mistake of her life"?
Jesse : She seemed to like it okay at the time.
Beckett : Where were you last night between 10 : 00 and 11 : 00?
Jesse : I was at a pool hall in Queens with some friends.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGS
Beckett : - Names. - PHONE CONTINUES RINGING
Beckett : Lanie, what's going on?
UNK: We have a little problem here.
Beckett : So what's the problem?
UNK: MRS. SUTTON : I'll tell you what the problem is.
Marilyn : That's not my daughter. That's not Mandy.
Beckett : So Mandy's mom identified our victim as Claire Samuels, 25.
Beckett : She was an aspiring actress.
UNK: - CASTLE : And Mandy's decoy. - Decoy?
Castle : Yeah, to fool the press.
Castle : It's a practice not uncommon in this age of stalkerazzi.
BECKETT : So, she'd dress up as Mandy, she'd put on sunglasses,
Beckett : she'd let the hordes follow her so that Mandy could go about unnoticed.
UNK: Now, we notified Claire's parents, they're flying in
Beckett : and Esposito's digging into her life as we speak.
Gates : So if Claire is our actual victim, then where's Mandy Sutton?
Beckett : We don't know. No one has seen her and she's not answering her phone.
