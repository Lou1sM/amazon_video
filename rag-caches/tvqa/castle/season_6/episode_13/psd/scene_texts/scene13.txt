Ken : But I never saw her.
Ken : I waited for the limo. But then that girl came out.
Ken : The not-Mandy, the other girl.
UNK: So I went around to the back alley and I waited across the street.
Ken : When the other girl goes in the front,
Ken : that means that Mandy goes in the back.
Ken : But she didn't.
Beckett : Wait, you waited for Mandy out in back?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : Did you see anything else?
Beckett : Did you see anyone go in or out of that alley?
Ken : Just the motorcycle.
UNK: Wait a minute. What motorcycle?
Ken : Well, right when I was going in the back,
Ken : there was a motorcycle that was going into the alley.
