CASTLE : Normally, it wouldn't be.
Castle : But the person who bought this phone made one crucial mistake.
Castle : They didn't get rid of it when they were done.
Castle : Matter of fact, it's still on right now.

Mandy : You set up that photo?
Mandy : You did this to me? Why would you do that?
UNK: Why do you wanna ruin my life?
Marilyn : It was Zach who was ruining your life. I was saving you.
Mandy : Wait a minute. Wait, you did this to break me up with Zach?
Mandy : He was the best thing that ever happened to me!
UNK: He was gonna take me away from all of this.
Marilyn : That's right, away from everything we'd worked for.
Marilyn : Your tour, your career, he was gonna cost you millions.
Mandy : You mean cost you millions.
Marilyn : And for what?
Mandy : A chance to be normal?
Marilyn : SCOFFS Normal.
UNK: You're special. Zach didn't understand that.
Marilyn : And neither did Claire.
Mandy : So you killed her?
UNK: She was gonna tell you what I'd done.
UNK: She was gonna make you hate me.
Marilyn : I couldn't let her drive a wedge between us. I couldn't.
BECKETT : Marilyn Sutton, please stand up.
Beckett : Turn around.
Beckett : You're under arrest for the murder of Claire Samuels.
UNK: HANDCUFFS CLICK
UNK: EXHALES Mandy, sweetie, you understand, right?
Marilyn : I did this for you, Mandy. Everything I did, I did for you.
Mandy : No, Mom. You did it for you.
BECKETT : Let's go.
Mandy : Just when I thought life couldn't get any more messed up, right?
UNK: SIGHS
Mandy : And the train wreck continues. The press is gonna love this.
UNK: Sorry. I'm gonna go. Thank you.
UNK: Um...
Castle : Hey, Mandy, sorry,
Castle : not to pry,
UNK: but it would be really easy just to run and hide from all this.
Castle : But don't.
UNK: Thanks.
Mandy : Thank you for all you guys did.
UNK: Um...
Mandy : Could you thank Alexis for me, too, please?
UNK: I will, yeah. She was here, actually. I don't know where she went.
Alexis : I'm back and I brought someone with me.
Castle : Hey, Mandy.
UNK: Zach.
UNK: SIGHS
Alexis : Once we realized Mandy hadn't really cheated on him,
Alexis : I tracked him down. I thought he needed to know.
UNK: - MOUTHS WORDS - CASTLE : Good.
Castle : I hope it works out for them.
Castle : Mandy needs something good in her life.
Alexis : They've got a shot. They seem to really love each other.
Alexis : For all the right reasons.
Beckett : Oh, um...
Castle : Speaking of boyfriends, Pi's letter of recommendation.
UNK: He did get the deadline extended, right?
Alexis : - No, he did. - Good.
Castle : How did I spell Pi? Did I put it like the dessert?
UNK: - 'Cause that was just... - No.
Alexis : Dad, you got it right.
UNK: Okay. CHUCKLES
UNK: SIGHS I'm just not sure I did.
UNK: Wait, where are you off to?
Alexis : There's something I need to do.

UNK: STAMMERING I didn't do this.
Beckett : Actually, I did.
Alexis : I thought you...
UNK: Yeah, I know, Castle. I like my privacy,
Beckett : but I do realize that you're somewhat famous.
UNK: Somewhat? SCOFFS
BECKETT : Yes. And if we're gonna be together,
Beckett : I have to come to terms with that.
UNK: And if they are gonna write about you, I want it to be the truth.
Beckett : I want it to be about us.
UNK: Well, there's no one I...
Castle : There's no one I'd rather share a headline with.
Castle : But just for the interest of accuracy,
UNK: does it say we're getting married in space?
UNK: No, that's not gonna happen, babe.
Castle : It'd be pretty fun.
UNK: Space.
