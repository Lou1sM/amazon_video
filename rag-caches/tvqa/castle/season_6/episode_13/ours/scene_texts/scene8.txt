Marilyn : What? What happened?
Marilyn : Where's Mandy?
UNK: CLUB MUSIC PLAYING
Alexis : SIGHS Are you sure I can't talk you out of this?
Mandy : There he is.
Mandy : There's Sam.
Alexis : Are you crazy? What are you doing? That's what I'm here for.
UNK: Sam!
Alexis : Hey, Sam!
UNK: That's not gonna get the job done there, Red.
UNK: Might wanna lose some layers,
Mandy : take off grandma's scarf.
Alexis : I have something else in mind. CLEARS THROAT
Alexis : So she was like, "Can you believe it?"
UNK: - And I was like, "No way!" - GASPS
Alexis : I am so sorry. Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Alexis : Oh, Sam, right? Could I please get her another drink?
Alexis : Oh, and there's someone here to see you.
UNK: Mandy? Oh, my God, girl, is that you?
Alexis : Can we talk somewhere more private?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, meet me over there.
Sam : Yo, I am so glad that you're okay. You had me worried.
Sam : I saw those pictures of you and Jesse,
Sam : the next thing you know, everybody's saying you're dead.
Mandy : What made you think I wasn't?
Sam : That clip on the news,
UNK: the one of the limo dropping "you" off at your building last night.
Sam : Except that girl wasn't you.
Alexis : How could you tell?
Sam : 'Cause that same girl was in here last night,
Sam : wearing the same thing she had on as when she got out of that limo.
Mandy : Wait a second. Claire was here last night?
Castle : Yeah, yeah, I think that's what her name was.
Alexis : You talked to her?
UNK: Yeah, she came in looking for me.
Sam : She heard I was friends with Mandy. She wanted her private number.
Mandy : What for?
Sam : She was trying to reach you
Sam : because she thought someone was trying to hurt you.
UNK: Who?
Sam : She didn't say, but she got way mad when I wouldn't give her your number.
UNK: Yeah. Man, I thought this girl was nuts, you know, a crazy fan or something?
UNK: Then she asked me how she can get in touch with Jesse.
UNK: Jesse? What does he have to do with this?
Esposito : I don't know,
Sam : but she was pretty hot to talk to him, too,
Sam : so I called Jesse, and I put him on with her.
Alexis : What'd she say?
UNK: I didn't hear. But she was pretty upset.
Sam : And since she ended up dead, I thought you should know.
WOMAN : Hey, Sam.
UNK: CHUCKLES
UNK: Hey, uh, wait here a second. People getting thirsty over there.
Alexis : I don't get it. Did Claire know Jesse?
Mandy : I don't know. I didn't think she did.
UNK: Well, there's only one way to find out. I'm calling Jesse.
Alexis : Wait. He could be involved.
Alexis : And if Claire thought someone was trying to kill you,
Alexis : do you really think it's a good idea to call...
UNK: Anybody ever tell your friend that she looks like Mandy Sutton?
Alexis : Yeah, she gets that all the time.
Alexis : It's a shame what happened to Mandy, isn't it?
UNK: Girl 2 : Hey, that is Mandy! Oh, my God. Mandy Sutton is alive!
Beckett : There's still no word on Jesse's whereabouts.
Esposito : Same with Mandy. But get this,
Esposito : when I called the limo company to see if she ordered up a ride
Esposito : from her hotel tonight, they said she didn't,
UNK: but they told me I wasn't the only guy asking that question.
Beckett : Someone else called?
UNK: Yeah, some guy who said that he was with her management company.
Esposito : But I checked. No one there made that call.
UNK: Jesse.
Esposito : Maybe he found out that she was still alive.
Beckett : Looks like everyone just did.
UNK: WOMAN ON TV : That Mandy Sutton, presumed dead, may actually be alive.
Newscaster : Mandy was reportedly just spotted at trendy downtown nightspot,
UNK: The Raptor Lounge.
Beckett : And now he knows where to find her.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGS
