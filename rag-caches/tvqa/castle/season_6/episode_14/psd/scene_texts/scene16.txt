Beckett : told him she could take down the magazine,
Beckett : and Matilda heard the whole thing.
UNK: Okay, thank you very much.
UNK: So, the guard in the lobby of the Modern Fashion building
UNK: saw Matilda leave there last night at 11 : 30.
UNK: And she was in a big hurry.
UNK: 11 : 30?
UNK: That's right after Ella called Marcus Conway.
UNK: Matilda knew that Ella was about to spill the beans
UNK: and bring down the magazine.
Beckett : So Matilda went to stop her.
UNK: She's our killer.
Carrie : Wait, wait, wait! She's on a call.
Beckett : She can call back.
MATILDA : Glen, this magazine is not about tweets,
Matilda : or likes on Facebook, for God's sake!
Matilda : For 57 years, women have been purchasing this magazine
Matilda : for the fashion!
GLEN : ON SPEAKERPHONE Matilda, please...
Matilda : Whenever they've had a bad day at work or at home,
Matilda : they've come to us, we are their escape.
Matilda : We are their fantasy!
Matilda : It's the clothing that stitches it all together!
Matilda : That's what matters!
GLEN : We're done here.
UNK: Glen!
UNK: Glen?
Matilda : Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.
UNK: EXHALES
Beckett : You've got a hell of a temper, Ms. King.
UNK: It's not temper. It's frustration.
UNK: Glen Carter, our new owner, cares more about money than fashion.
UNK: Is that why you were paranoid he was gonna replace you?
Matilda : I don't know what you've heard, but I'm Matilda King.
Matilda : My name is synonymous with this magazine.
Matilda : He wouldn't dare replace me.
Beckett : So then why did you order the monitoring
UNK: of all of your employees' conversations
