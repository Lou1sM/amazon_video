Beckett : And did someone kill her to keep her quiet?
Ryan : Can't help you out there, but I can tell you that
Ryan : Marcus Conway was telling the truth about not planting that bug.
Esposito : Yeah, the serial number led us to a distributer
UNK: named Alternate Intelligence, in Queens.
Beckett : Do they know who bought it?
Ryan : James Kavanaugh paid for that listening device
UNK: with a credit card a month ago.
UNK: And when does it get interesting?
Esposito : When we found out he was former Special Forces.
UNK: And, not to mention, the head of security at Modern Fashion.
Beckett : Wait a minute. Ella was being spied on by her own magazine?
UNK: - PHONE CHIMES - Uh...
Castle : Oh, Beckett, we have that appointment at The Cordova House.
Beckett : Castle, I'm sorry. Duty calls.
Beckett : Can you go without me?
Beckett : And see if it's as good as the pictures.
Castle : You trust me to make this decision on my own?
Beckett : Can you go with Martha?
UNK: CHUCKLES
Beckett : We have to bring James Kavanaugh in.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: James Kavanaugh : I'm in the security business. I buy lots of equipment.
Esposito : Yeah, well, this equipment
Esposito : was a listening device that you installed in Ella Hayes' apartment.
Kavanaugh : If you think that, you're mistaken.
UNK: Really?
Beckett : Because we showed your picture to the super at Ella's building,
Beckett : and he identified you as the exterminator he let into her apartment.
Kavanaugh : I had nothing to do with what happened to Ella Hayes.
Beckett : You broke into her place, you wired it for sound,
Beckett : and now she's dead.
Esposito : James. Think about how that looks, bro.
Beckett : Your best bet is to tell us exactly what you know.
Kavanaugh : All I did was bug her place, okay?
