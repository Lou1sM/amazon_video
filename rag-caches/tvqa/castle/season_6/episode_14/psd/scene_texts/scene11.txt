UNK: Why is a high-powered lawyer going after Ella?
Esposito : Maybe it has to do with her work.
Esposito : Turns out that Marcus Conway
UNK: is general counsel for Couture Chick magazine.
UNK: That's "chic." And not that you would know,
UNK: but they are Modern Fashion's biggest competitor.
Beckett : Call Conway's firm. I want to know where he is.
UNK: Detective, I would think very carefully
UNK: Marcus Conway : before making these kinds of accusations.
Beckett : Mr. Conway, I am not making any accusations.
UNK: I'm simply stating fact.
Beckett : We have a witness that heard you threatening Ella Hayes.
Beckett : And another one that saw you near where she was killed.
Castle : Right about the same time she ended up that way.
Beckett : - You need to explain yourself. - DOOR OPENS
UNK: Gloria Robbins : Marcus, I heard the police are here.
UNK: Gloria Robbins : What's going on?
Beckett : - Who are you? - Gloria Robbins.
UNK: I'm editor-in-chief of Couture Chic.
Conway : They think I murdered Ella Hayes.
Gloria : What? That's ridiculous.
Beckett : So you know who she is?
Gloria : This is obviously one huge misunderstanding.
Beckett : Then clear it up, tell me what you know about Ella Hayes.
Conway : We approached Ella and attempted to engage her services.
