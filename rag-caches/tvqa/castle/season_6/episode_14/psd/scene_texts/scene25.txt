Montoya : Next I hear, she's dead.
Beckett : Do you still have that IP address?
Esposito : Yeah, okay. I'll have Tech run it down.
Esposito : But why would anyone want to sabotage a fashion assistant?
Beckett : I don't know, Espo.
UNK: But if Ella went after whoever is behind this, maybe she found them.
Castle : All right. I'll give you a call when I get a location.
Beckett : Okay. Thanks.
Matilda : More questions, Detective?
Beckett : Actually, we found evidence
Beckett : that suggests Ella wasn't responsible for screwing up your appointments.
Beckett : Someone else changed your calendar. Someone outside of this office.
UNK: Are you saying that I fired Ella for no reason?
Beckett : Do you know why someone would have done this to her?
UNK: No.
Matilda : But I do know why someone would want to do this to me.
