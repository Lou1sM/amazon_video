Grace : But I overheard them and he was threatening her.
Grace : He said she had something he wanted
Grace : and he wouldn't take "no" for an answer.
Beckett : And what was her reaction?
UNK: She said she was gonna call the police if he didn't leave her the hell alone.
Grace : And then he stormed off.
Grace : I tried to ask her what it was all about, but she wouldn't tell me.
Beckett : Do you remember him well enough to help us with a sketch?
Grace : I think so.
UNK: Okay. This is the guy who threatened Ella.
Castle : So you believe Grace's story?
Beckett : Her alibi checks out
Beckett : and unis found two witnesses that saw him arguing with Ella.
Castle : Ella was basically a glorified assistant.
Castle : What could she possibly have had that this man wanted?
