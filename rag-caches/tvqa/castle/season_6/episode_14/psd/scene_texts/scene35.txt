Castle : So you made a choice.
BECKETT : Once you were chosen for the Fab Five,
Beckett : you realized that Ella would know you had stolen her designs.
Beckett : You had to discredit her so that no one would believe her.
Yumi : I want a lawyer.
UNK: Ella must've confronted Yumi at his studio.
UNK: If she threatened to expose the whole scandal, his career would be over.
Castle : He had to kill her to hide the truth.
Beckett : Yeah, that all makes sense.
Beckett : Now we just have to connect him to the crime scene.
UNK: Only one problem. You can't.
Ryan : Yumi didn't kill Ella.
Beckett : How do you know?
Ryan : Multiple employees saw Ella confront Yumi.
Ryan : But after she took off, he was at the studio until 3 : 00 a.m.
Ryan : He never left.
Beckett : Are you sure?
UNK: His alibi is rock-solid.
Castle : But we know someone changed Matilda's calendar from that studio,
Castle : he has to be involved somehow.
Ryan : I think someone else was too.
Ryan : I went through Yumi's phone records.
