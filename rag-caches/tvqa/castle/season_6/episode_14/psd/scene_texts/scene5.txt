Grace : which means my career in fashion is pretty much done.
Grace : Thanks to Ella.
Beckett : Because you believed it was her fault that you got fired.
Beckett : It was her fault.
Grace : She started making mistakes because she was so busy
Grace : sucking up to designers like Yumi, and showing off her sketches.
Grace : And I paid the price.
Beckett : Which is why you killed her.
UNK: What are you even talking about?
UNK: We got in a fight. That was it.
UNK: Okay, okay. Then explain this.
Beckett : This blue alpaca scarf was found at your apartment.
Beckett : It's an exact match to the hairs found on Ella's neck
Beckett : after she was strangled.
Grace : Come on. Other people have that scarf.
UNK: Yeah. But you're the only one with motive.
Grace : It was the Christmas gift from Modern Fashion.
Grace : We all got the scarf.
Grace : Maybe Ella was wearing hers and someone choked her with it.
Beckett : Where were you between 12 : 00 and 2 : 00 a.m., Grace?
