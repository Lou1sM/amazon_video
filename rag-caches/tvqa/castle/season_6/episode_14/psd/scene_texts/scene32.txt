UNK: Amazing. Yeah. So amazing.
Castle : And they didn't have any spots open until fall of 2015.
Castle : But a couple just broke up,
Castle : and their unfortunate misery can be our lifelong joy.
Castle : We can take their spot for this spring!
Leslie : This spring.
Castle : - Wow. - I know.
UNK: And there are a lot of couples who want it.
UNK: But if I put down the deposit tonight, it's ours.
Castle : So what do you say?
Castle : Beckett, are you there?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Okay. But I thought we agreed that the venue was amazing.
Beckett : Yeah, we did. It's just...
UNK: I started thinking about all the details and the planning that we have to do.
Beckett : I don't want to rush any of this.
UNK: Okay. If you're sure that's it?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, it is.
UNK: I mean, we're gonna find another venue, Castle.
UNK: It's gonna be great.
Castle : - Look, if... - ESPOSITO : Hey.
Esposito : So Tech was able to track down that IP address.
Esposito : Whoever changed that calendar did it from a design studio in Soho.
Beckett : Is there any connection between the studio and Modern Fashion?
Esposito : As a matter of fact, there is.
Esposito : It belongs to one of the designers
Esposito : being featured in Modern Fashion's Fab Five spread.
Grace : - Yumi. - Yumi what?
Esposito : Just Yumi.
Esposito : I guess if you don't have a last name you can charge more.
Castle : So why would he, or someone from his studio, be changing Matilda's calendar?
Esposito : I don't know, but I can tell you this.
Esposito : It looks like Ella may have been there the night she was killed.
