Matilda : Detective Beckett,
UNK: you said "no" to me years ago when I offered you a job.
Matilda : Might you do a little favor for me now?
MARTHA : Oh! Richard, look at these beautiful antique chandeliers.
Leslie : So if you're interested,
Leslie : I have a couple of slots for fall 2015 still open.
Castle : Excuse me, did you say fall 2015?
Leslie : That's correct.
Castle : When we spoke on the phone, I thought we were speaking of this fall.
Leslie : No way. That's been booked for months.
UNK: PHONE RINGING
Leslie : Excuse me, but I have to take this call.
Leslie : Look around and I'll be right back.
UNK: Ugh! Well, it is a beautiful venue.
UNK: And it's a long time to wait.
UNK: Mmm. And a long time to plan.
Castle : I just feel like I've waited long enough, Mother.
Castle : I don't want to waste any more time before we take the next step.
