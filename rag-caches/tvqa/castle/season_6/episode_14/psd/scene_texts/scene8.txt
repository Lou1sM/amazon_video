Beckett : Think about it, Castle. Matilda King is the most influential person in fashion.
Beckett : And Ella had direct access to her world.
Castle : So, you're saying this man leveraged Ella
UNK: to find out what direction hemlines are going next season?
Castle : Oh! I just came up with a new title.
Castle : Murder is the New Black.
Beckett : Does that even make sense?
RYAN : No, it doesn't. And here's something else that doesn't make sense.
Beckett : Did you guys find something at Ella's apartment?
RYAN : You could say that.
UNK: I went to use the landline and I noticed some static when I got near a lamp.
Esposito : When we popped the lamp open, look what we found inside.
Beckett : A bug?
Beckett : Why would someone bug Ella's apartment?
CASTLE : Because
UNK: she's La Femme Nikita
Castle : and her job at Modern Fashion is just a cover.
Beckett : She's not La Femme Nikita.
UNK: Still, wire-taps? Threats from mysterious men?
Castle : Murder? Whatever's going on here, it's bigger than fashion.
UNK: Okay. See if you can get a serial number.
Beckett : Let's figure out who bought that bug.
UNK: Yep.
Castle : All right. Thank you very much.
UNK: Hey.
Castle : That was the event planner at The Cordova House,
Castle : they said they still have a few spots open in the fall.
