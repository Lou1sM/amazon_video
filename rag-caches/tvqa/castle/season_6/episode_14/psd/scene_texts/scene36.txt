Ryan : And after Ella left, he made half a dozen phone calls
Ryan : to Modern Fashion.
Matilda : Such beautiful designs.
Matilda : After all this time. I had no idea.
Matilda : If she knew these designs had been stolen,
Matilda : why didn't she come to me?
Beckett : Maybe she didn't think you'd listen.
Beckett : At least, not to someone like her.
Beckett : Maybe she just wanted revenge.
UNK: She would've gotten it.
UNK: If Couture Chic exposed that our Fab Five list was corrupt,
Matilda : it would have cost me my job.
Castle : Who else stood to lose?
Matilda : Everyone involved, I suppose.
Beckett : Just after Ella left Yumi's studio,
Beckett : he made a series of phone calls to someone here at Modern Fashion.
Castle : Someone who must have known Yumi's secret,
Castle : who was helping him cover it up,
UNK: someone who knew that if the truth got out, it could destroy them both.
Matilda : There's only one person it could be.
UNK: Who?
UNK: We go to print in one week on this issue
Matilda : and I'm still not happy with the cover options.
Matilda : And we're still not there with the Fab Five spread.
Matilda : Now go. Please, make it better.
UNK: Julian, a word.
UNK: CLOSES DOOR
Matilda : What was your first reaction when you saw Yumi's design submission?
Julian : Blown away. That's why I nominated him.
Matilda : Now is there a reason why you didn't come to me
Matilda : and tell me when he confessed to you that he stole Ella's design?
Carrie : What do you mean?
Matilda : I had a word with Yumi this morning.
Matilda : He told me you've known for a while.
Matilda : And he also said it was your idea to change my calendar.
Julian : He's lying.
UNK: But then I spoke to Mr. Carter and he confirmed my suspicion.
Matilda : You've been gunning for my job.
