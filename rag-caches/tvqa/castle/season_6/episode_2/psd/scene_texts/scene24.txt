UNK: Kevin Ryan : I just always thought that you and I would have kids together.
UNK: Really? Well, have you talked to Jenny about this?
UNK: Hell, you know what I mean.
UNK: They'd be on the same tee ball and Pop Warner teams.
Ryan : - We'd co-coach. - Co-coach?
UNK: - You wanna be head coach? - Yeah.
Ryan : - Try getting a date first. - Dude.
Ryan : Hey, Martha. What brings you here?
Martha : Look, I know you're busy, but I'm worried about Richard.
UNK: Really? Why?
Martha : Last night he was just whisked away by a couple of federal agent thugs.
Martha : Then when I talked to him today,
Martha : he was nice, sincere, no smart-ass quips.
Martha : So, something is definitely wrong.
Martha : And Katherine isn't answering my calls.
UNK: Well, I'm sure there's an explanation.
Martha : And I need you to find out what it is.
UNK: - SIGHS - Any trouble breathing?
UNK: Yeah, but I think that's just anxiety.
Goldberg : - I can get you a sedative. - No.
UNK: Thank you. But I think I'd rather stay sharp as long as possible.
Mccord : Oh, sorry.
Castle : No. No problem. We're all done here.
Mccord : You want a coffee?
Castle : No, I'd rather die than drink any more of that sludge.
UNK: Oh.
Castle : Too soon?
Castle : Agent McCord, can I ask you a question?
UNK: Yep.
Castle : How is she doing here?
Mccord : Beckett? She's good. She has a lot of potential.
Castle : So, she'll be okay.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: She's gonna be great.
Richmond : Hey, McCord. I'm in.
UNK: I cross-referenced the flight recording database at Bagram
Richmond : with parameters from the mission documents.
Richmond : If that information was accurate,
Richmond : this should be audio of the Zawari strike.
UNK: MAN 1 : Alpha One, Eagle's contact target.
UNK: MAN 2 : Copy, Eagle. Omaha, what's your status? Over.
Beckett : That's Defense Secretary Reed.
Mccord : As theater commander, he'd be running the operation.
BRONSON : Alpha One, Valkyrie's still inside target.
Castle : That's Bronson's voice. So, Valkyrie must be Zawari.
UNK: MAN1 : Eagle, prepare to engage.
BRONSON : Alpha One, Valkyrie's still inside. Signaling to get her out.
UNK: Get her out? Valkyrie's not Zawari. Maybe it's the servant.
REED : Omaha, Valkyrie needs to get out now.
BRONSON : I'm signaling, Alpha One, no response. Stand by.
REED : We're not missing our window.
UNK: Eagle, this is Alpha One. Engage target.
BRONSON : Negative, Eagle.
UNK: Bronson audio : We have an American intelligence asset in there,
UNK: Bronson audio : and we need to wait for her to get out.
UNK: Bronson audio : An intelligence asset?
UNK: Bronson audio : Just give me two minutes.
REED : Negative, Omaha, we can't risk losing Raptor.
UNK: Reed audio : On my authority, you are clear to engage target. Over.
UNK: MAN 1 : Missile engaged.
UNK: - BRONSON : No, Valkyrie's still in there! - EXPLOSION
UNK: MAN 1 : Target destroyed. Eagle heading home.
REED : Omaha, retrieve Valkyrie's body and get her back to Dreamworld.
UNK: Reed audio : Protocol Boomerang. Over.
OMAHA : Roger.
Castle : Valkyrie was the servant. She was one of ours.
Mccord : No wonder the transcript was so heavily redacted.
Beckett : Secretary Reed killed an American operative.
Castle : And then ordered Bronson to cover it up.
UNK: MAN1 : Missile engaged.
BRONSON : No, Valkyrie's still in there!
UNK: EXPLOSION
UNK: MAN 1 : Target destroyed. Eagle heading home.
REED : Omaha, retrieve Valkyrie's body and get her back to Dreamworld.
UNK: Reed audio : Protocol Boomerang. Over.
OMAHA : Roger.
Vilante : So what are we saying here?
Vilante : That Bronson was murdered to cover up the death of an American operative,
