UNK: Look, whatever this is, it has nothing to do with me.
UNK: You might wanna remember the first rule of combat.
UNK: You don't ever start a war you can't win.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGING
UNK: What?
UNK: Hey, Beckett, it's Esposito and Ryan. Is everything okay?
Beckett : Fine. Why?
ESPOSITO : Castle's mom came by, all worried about him.
Esposito : Come on, Beckett, what's going on?
Beckett : Everything's fine.
UNK: You take a breath in through the nose and out through the mouth.
Castle : Like yoga.
Vilante : What the hell were you thinking?
Beckett : Sir, I was just following a hunch.
Vilante : Next time, follow orders.
Vilante : I had to go to the mat with the Attorney General to keep your job.
Beckett : Wait. Secretary Reed complained to the Attorney General?
UNK: If that surprises you, you're not as smart as I thought.
Beckett : No, sir. It's just, if Reed was behind this,
Beckett : he wouldn't have made that call.
UNK: Right, because he wouldn't wanna call attention to himself.
Vilante : Is that why you went out there?
Vilante : To force him to show his hand?
Vilante : I'm impressed.
Beckett : Yeah, well, don't be.
Beckett : Looks like I just ruled out our only lead.
McCORD : Guys, I've got something.
Mccord : I was following up on Valkyrie to see if there was anything more to the story.
Mccord : This is a family photo we got from Rasheed.
Mccord : He identified this woman as the servant
Beckett : whose body Bronson took after the air strike.
Mccord : And we've identified her as Farrah Usman.
UNK: Yeah, she's listed as a civilian contractor
Hendricks : working out of the U.S. Consulate in Kabul.
Mccord : It's a typical cover for an intelligence operative.
UNK: Yeah, and she was supposedly killed by a roadside I.E.D.
UNK: The same night as the Zawari attack.
Vilante : Well, that makes sense.
Vilante : The injuries from an I.E.D. look a lot like those from an air strike.
Mccord : That's not the story. Look at this.
