Castle : Dreamworld is the code name of a special ops ghost base
Castle : somewhere in the Middle East.
UNK: And you think that that somehow relates to the theft of the toxin?
UNK: I think Bronson thought it did.
UNK: KNOCKING ON DOOR
UNK: Sorry to interrupt. I'm Dr. Goldberg, here to check on Mr. Castle.
UNK: Rachel Mccord : How's he doing?
Beckett : Better than I am. Where are we?
Mccord : Well, we know whoever's behind this framed Jack Bronson for the break-in,
Mccord : and then used the toxin to kill him.
UNK: Which means they would've had to have crossed paths with him
Beckett : in order to deliver it.
Mccord : Exactly. Hendricks and his team are retracing all of Bronson's movements
Mccord : to get a who and a when.
Mccord : It's a needle in a haystack, but maybe we'll get lucky.
Beckett : Anything on Valkyrie?
Mccord : Nothing that connects. Analysts are still working on it, though.
Beckett : Have you ever heard of something called Dreamworld?
Mccord : What's Dreamworld?
GOLDBERG : The pralidoxime and atropine
Goldberg : will stave off the effect of the toxin
Goldberg : and buy you some more time.
Castle : How much more?
Goldberg : An hour, maybe two.
Goldberg : I'll give you another shot every four hours,
Goldberg : but eventually, it won't be effective.
