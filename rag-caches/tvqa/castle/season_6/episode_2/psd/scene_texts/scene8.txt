Parker : But I'm guessing that the subject matter struck a nerve.
Parker : Look, prior to his appointment as Secretary of Defense,
Parker : General Reed was in charge of Central Command,
Parker : which ran all missions out of Dreamworld.
UNK: Are you suggesting that the Secretary of Defense is hiding something?
Parker : You have another explanation?
Beckett : So, a stolen military toxin and a secret government base.
Beckett : I mean, what do you think this is all about?
Mccord : I don't know, but I have a feeling Bronson did.
Beckett : Where are we headed?
UNK: To talk to the one person who might actually know what's going on.
UNK: The former commander of Dreamworld, Defense Secretary Reed.
Mccord : Mr. Secretary.
UNK: Defense Secretary Reed : This must be damned important
UNK: Defense Secretary Reed : if the Attorney General's personally asking me to take this meeting.
Mccord : It is.
Mccord : Three days ago, a lethal toxin was stolen from a government lab.
Mccord : Our investigations led us to the murder of an ex-marine named Jack Bronson.
Mccord : Do you know him?
Reed : It's possible. A lot of men served under my command.
Reed : Why? You think he was involved in this theft?
Beckett : No. But he may have known who was.
UNK: We believe that this is connected to a military base named Dreamworld.
