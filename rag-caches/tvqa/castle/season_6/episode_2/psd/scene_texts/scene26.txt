Beckett : Either he's involved,
Beckett : or he knows a hell of a lot more than he's telling us.
Vilante : Only, you have no proof.
Vilante : Listen, Beckett, I know what's at stake.
Vilante : For you and for Castle.
Vilante : But I can't let you go at him without concrete evidence.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: So, I'm guessing Villante said no to the idea of waterboarding the truth
Castle : out of Secretary Reed.
Beckett : Yeah, something like that.
Beckett : How are you feeling?
UNK: Ah, good. I think I'm just due for another shot.
Beckett : I'm Agent Beckett from the Attorney General's office.
Beckett : - I need to speak with Secretary Reed. - Do you have an appointment?
Beckett : No. This is a matter of national security.
Bodyguard : I'm sorry, if you don't have an appointment, I have to ask you...
Beckett : Just please get to the Secretary. I told you, this is a matter...
UNK: - Ma'am, you need to step back. - Secretary Reed!
Beckett : Secretary Reed, Agent Beckett from the Attorney General's office!
Beckett : We met earlier today, sir.
UNK: Mary Reed : Michael, who is that?
Reed : I'll take care of it.
Beckett : Sir, we just need to speak. This is a matter of national security.
UNK: Joseph.
Reed : You show up at my home? Who the hell do you think you are?
Beckett : I should ask you the same thing.
Beckett : You lied about Valkyrie. You obstructed a federal investigation.
Reed : I told you all you need to know.
Beckett : I need to know everything. What is going on and what are you hiding?
Reed : You are barking up the wrong tree, Agent, and it's gonna cost you.
Beckett : There's a deadly toxin out there.
Beckett : If so much as one person dies because you won't cooperate, then I...
UNK: You'll what?
