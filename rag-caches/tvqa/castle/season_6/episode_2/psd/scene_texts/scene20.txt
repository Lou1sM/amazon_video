UNK: SIGHS I don't think he's our guy.
Goldberg : Based on?
Beckett : His story. I mean, he said that he saw Bronson carrying a servant girl's body?
Beckett : I mean, the only way that he'd come up with a story like that was if it was true.
Castle : So, aside from the name Valkyrie,
UNK: which no one we've spoken to seems to know anything about,
Castle : we pretty much have nothing.
Castle : Which means I'm a dead man.
Beckett : No, Castle. Not nothing.
Beckett : We have what Bronson told you, what Rasheed told us.
Beckett : We know that this revolves around something that happened
UNK: the night Zawari was killed.
