UNK: Something more than just the air strike.
Beckett : Now, what we have to do is figure out what it was.
Vilante : I'll have D.O.D. Send over the mission documents.
Vilante : Maybe something in there will help shed some light.
BECKETT : These are the mission documents?
Mccord : Is there even a sentence that doesn't have redactions?
Richmond : Not a complete one.
Richmond : Somebody is definitely trying to hide whatever went on here.
UNK: I'm sorry, Castle. This is pointless.
Castle : Can you do a word search for "Valkyrie"?
UNK: KEYBOARD CLACKING
UNK: COMPUTER PROCESSING
Richmond : It doesn't appear in the document. Probably because it was redacted.
Castle : Right, but what about a search for blacked-out, eight-letter words
Castle : the same length as Valkyrie?
UNK: Aren't all eight-letter words the same length?
Castle : Well, not in a proportional font like Times Roman.
UNK: Um, each character will vary in size
UNK: from the narrowest, lower case "i," to the widest, the upper case "W."
UNK: So the combination of letters in the word "Valkyrie"
Castle : will create a very specific length, not unlike a typographical fingerprint.
