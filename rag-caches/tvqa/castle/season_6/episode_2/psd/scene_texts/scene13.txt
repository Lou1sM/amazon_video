Castle : It's my mother.
Castle : She's been calling all morning. I can't avoid her forever.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Hello, Mother. To what do I owe the pleasure?
Martha : Richard, you were ushered out of here last night like a common criminal.
Martha : You don't answer my calls. What the hell is going on?
Castle : No, Mother, I'm fine.
UNK: Alexis Castle : Dad, did they arrest you? Do you need us to bail you out?
Pi : What about a lawyer, Mr. C? I know a guy at the ACLU.
Martha : Oh, please.
UNK: No.
UNK: Uh, I just had some special knowledge of a case that Beckett's working on.
UNK: She had them send an escort, that's all.
Martha : Oh, well, thank God.
UNK: Um, oh, Gina called this morning.
UNK: She has a bunch of books for you to sign for some company VIPs.
UNK: Right. They're in my office, at the back bookcase.
Castle : If I'm not there tomorrow, she can come pick them up.
Castle : And, Mother,
Castle : thank you.
Alexis : When's he coming back?
Castle : Let me talk to Alexis.
Martha : He wants to talk to you, honey.
Alexis : Hey, Dad.
Castle : Hopefully, I'll be back tomorrow morning.
Beckett : And, um...
UNK: And you know I love you, right?
Alexis : Of course.
UNK: WHISPERS It's time for your next shot.
UNK: Already?
Alexis : Dad? Everything okay?
Castle : Yeah. They're calling me, so I have to go.
Alexis : Okay. See you tomorrow.
Castle : Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
