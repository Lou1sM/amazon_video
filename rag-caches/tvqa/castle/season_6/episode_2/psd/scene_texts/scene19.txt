Rasheed : And when he saw me,
Rasheed : he drew his gun.
Rasheed : And I thought, for sure, I was a dead man.
Rasheed : But then he spoke.
Rasheed : And he knew my name, and where I lived, and what I did.
Rasheed : And he told me that if I told anyone about what I had seen, he would kill me.
Rasheed : And then he left.
Rasheed : With the body.
Mccord : He took away a dead servant's body?
UNK: Look, I've done my best to forget about it all.
Rasheed : Until he found me in the coffee shop, and he kept asking me,
UNK: "Who did you tell? Why are they setting me up?"
Rasheed : And I swore to him I didn't tell anybody.
Rasheed : Okay, whatever is happening here, whatever is going on,
Rasheed : I swear to you, I have nothing to do with it.
Vilante : So, none of the intelligence agencies
Vilante : can link Rasheed to known Al-Qaeda elements.
Vilante : And he's got a solid alibi for the night of the break-in.
Mccord : He could still be involved.
Mccord : Is there any chatter about an imminent attack?
Vilante : No more than usual.
Vilante : What's your take on Rasheed?
