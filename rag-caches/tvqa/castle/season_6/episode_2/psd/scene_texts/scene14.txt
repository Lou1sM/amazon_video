Alexis : Did Dad sound weird to you?
BECKETT : Sir, we've got something.
Mccord : Turns out you were right about Zawari's family.
Mccord : We identified six members of his extended family living in the U.S.
Mccord : Four in California, and two cousins right here in D.C.
Beckett : We were in the process of running them down when Hendricks found this.
UNK: Yeah, in reconstructing Bronson's movements prior to his death,
Hendricks : we were able to track him to here, a coffee shop in Dupont Circle.
Hendricks : A few seconds after he leaves, this man follows him out.
Mccord : We've ID'd him as Waqas Rasheed, second cousin to Zawari.
HENDRICKS : And Agent Richmond is trying to track him down.
Hendricks : But here's what we know. He has dual U.S. -Afghan citizenship,
UNK: is a graduate engineering student at Georgetown.
Beckett : And, sir, he was in Jalalabad the night of the Zawari air strike.
Beckett : Five of his other cousins were killed in the attack.
Mccord : Burying that many family members, that could radicalize anyone.
RICHMOND : Got him.
Richmond : We got him. We have a live feed
UNK: of Rasheed walking east on 14th Street, between E and F.
Vilante : - Backpack. - Could be the toxin.
Beckett : - And the antidote. - Let's move!
UNK: TIRES SQUEALING
BOTH : Stop!
UNK: Federal agents, stop!
UNK: CARS HONKING
UNK: BOTH GRUNTING
Beckett : It's not here.
UNK: PANTING
Beckett : Where's the toxin? Rasheed, where's the toxin?
CASTLE : What if he doesn't talk?
Vilante : He'll talk. They always do.
Castle : What if he doesn't talk in time?
Vilante : We have teams combing his apartment.
Vilante : If he has the toxin and the antidote, they'll find 'em.
Castle : Thanks. For letting me be a part of this.
Vilante : When you write your next novel,
Vilante : maybe you'll find a place for a dashing Colombian-American federal agent.
