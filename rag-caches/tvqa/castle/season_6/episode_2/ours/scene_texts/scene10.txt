Beckett : It's over, Parker!
Beckett : We know everything.
Beckett : Now give us the antidote before it's too late!
UNK: GRUNTING
Beckett : No, wait...
Parker : Did Reed wait when he ordered the strike? No.
Parker : No, now it's his turn to see how it feels.
UNK: She's gonna die.
Parker : Just like Farrah.
Beckett : Please, Parker, she's not the only one that you've poisoned.
UNK: My fiancÃ©'s dying. He needs that antidote.
Parker : No, you don't understand.
Parker : You're too late.
Beckett : - It's too late. - GUN COCKING
McCORD : You better hope you're wrong.
BECKETT : WHISPERING Castle.
UNK: BEEPING
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hi.
Castle : I had the strangest dream, and you were there.
Martha : - Oh, thank God! - Hi, Dad.
Castle : And you were there. And you were there.
Pi : Hey, Mr. C.
Pi : I did some healing Reiki on you. Looks like it worked.
Castle : And you were there.
UNK: LAUGHS I think he's gonna be all right.
Castle : Yeah, thanks to you.
UNK: Well, why don't we give you guys a moment? Come on.
Alexis : We'll be outside if you need us.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : - Love you. - Love you, too.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey.
Castle : How was your weekend?
UNK: Mmm, you know. Uneventful. Yours?
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Same.
Castle : But at least I got to see you.
Beckett : I'm so sorry, Castle.
Beckett : This wasn't supposed to be this hard.
Castle : What, Washington, or us?
Castle : Sometimes, the hardest things in life
Castle : are the things most worth doing.
Castle : Just because we haven't figured it out yet doesn't mean we won't.
Castle : Tell you what, though,
Castle : next time I say I'm dying to see you, let's keep it metaphoric.
UNK: WHISPERING Deal.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Rachel Mccord : How's he doing?
Beckett : He's okay, considering.
Beckett : What about Mrs. Reed?
Mccord : Uh, she will pull through.
Beckett : And what about Secretary Reed? What's gonna happen with him?
Mccord : What do you mean?
Beckett : He withheld information to save his own ass.
Beckett : People almost died because of it.
Mccord : Well, we both know it's not that simple.
UNK: Well, there's gonna be an investigation at least, right?
Mccord : You want everything to be black or white, I get it.
Mccord : But in this town it rarely is.
Mccord : And to do this job, you have to make peace with that.
Mccord : But, hey, that was a hell of a hunch about Mrs. Reed.
Mccord : You should feel really good about this.
Beckett : Yeah, well, that was Castle.
Mccord : But you were smart enough to act on it. That was your call.
UNK: And you backed me up without even knowing my play.
Mccord : That's what partners do.
Beckett : Yeah. That's what partners do.
