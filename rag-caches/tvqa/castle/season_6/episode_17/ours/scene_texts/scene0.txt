BECKETT : This is heaven.
UNK: Kate Beckett : This is absolute heaven.
UNK: Richard Castle : Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?
Beckett : No, not that.
Beckett : Not that?
Beckett : No, I mean, not only that.
UNK: It's 2 : 00.
Beckett : I'm in my PJs. We're reading the newspapers.
Beckett : I never get to do this.
Castle : Because you never take any time off.
UNK: All we have to do is loaf around. There's no work.
Beckett : No goals other than to waste hours on end.
Castle : Okay, stop describing my life.
Castle : So, there is one thing we should get done today.
Castle : We need to pick a font for our "Save the Date" cards.
UNK: Really? We're gonna do that?
Beckett : We don't even have a venue yet.
UNK: Yeah, I find deadlines inspiring.
Castle : How about this one?
Beckett : No, it's too frilly.
UNK: Agreed.
UNK: And this... Ooh, this is far too severe.
UNK: IN GERMAN ACCENT You vill save ze date, now.
UNK: CHUCKLES
Beckett : Oh, I like that one. You?
UNK: IN NORMAL VOICE Mmm, I'm not really feeling it.
UNK: Though, I guess, uh, you could convince me.
Beckett : I bet I could.
Castle : Yeah, I mean, you'd have to work pretty hard to win me over.
Beckett : Well, I'm prepared to do just that.
UNK: Because it's clear to me that what we both need right now
UNK: is a really good font.
Castle : Yes, we do. That's so true.
UNK: - CELL PHONE RINGING - Oh!
Castle : And worst timing ever.
UNK: RINGING CONTINUES
UNK: GROANS
Beckett : - Beckett. - GATES : Detective.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : How soon can you get here?
Beckett : Uh, sir, I'm actually not on call today.
Gates : I'm aware of that, but something has come up
Gates : and I'm afraid it can't wait.
Beckett : Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.
Gates : One more thing, come alone.
Gates : Do not bring Mr. Castle.
UNK: Uh... Yes, sir.
Castle : So, what's Gates up to?
Castle : Aside from sabotaging our domestic bliss?
Beckett : - I don't know, but I gotta go. - Huh.
Castle : I don't suppose I could convince you...
UNK: - No. Yeah. - Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, don't worry. It's fine. Don't worry about it.
UNK: I'm fine. I'll do some writing,
Castle : if I can manage to focus.
ESPOSITO : Yo, Beckett.
UNK: Javier Esposito : I thought you were off.
Beckett : - Was that the Deputy Commissioner? - Yeah.
Esposito : There's been more brass through here than a marching band.
Beckett : What's going on?
UNK: It's all need-to-know, and we didn't make the list.
UNK: But whatever is happening is going down in that conference room.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : - Detective. - Yeah...
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Sorry.
UNK: Richard Castle : - Yeah. - Yeah.
Gates : Detective Beckett. Captain Fowler, head of Narcotics.
