Fowler : But they're invisible, these guys.
Fowler : They don't use banks, so we can't follow the money.
Fowler : They make sure their street dealers never meet their suppliers.
UNK: So when you bust a dealer, he doesn't know who he's working for.
Fowler : Exactly. So, three months in and we have nothing.
Fowler : We don't even know any of their names.
Fowler : Except for Lazarus.
Beckett : - And who is Lazarus? - The leader.
Fowler : Not his real name, of course.
UNK: Then yesterday, a phone intercept led us to this woman.
Fowler : Elena Markov.
Fowler : She copped to being a low-level drug courier in the ring.
Fowler : Born in Russia, she came here as a mail-order bride,
Fowler : divorced her husband,
Fowler : she learned to speak English better than we do
Fowler : and was getting by as a freelance translator.
Fowler : She'd never been in trouble before.
UNK: At least, not till now.
ELENA : I needed work and I heard about a way to make money.
UNK: Elena Markov on Video : All I had to do was call a number, so I did.
UNK: Elena Markov on Video : Once I got in, I couldn't get out.
FOWLER : Who was your contact in the ring?
UNK: Elena on Video : I didn't have one.
UNK: Elena on Video : I would get a text with a time and a place.
UNK: Elena on Video : And I'd get a package with a note hidden inside
UNK: Elena on Video : that would tell me where to take it.
UNK: Fowler on Video : Did you ever, um, see anyone? Did you ever interact with anyone?
UNK: Elena on Video : Everything was anonymous.
