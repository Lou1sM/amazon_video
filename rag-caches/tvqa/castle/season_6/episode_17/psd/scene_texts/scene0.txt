BECKETT : This is heaven.
UNK: Kate Beckett : This is absolute heaven.
UNK: Richard Castle : Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?
Beckett : No, not that.
Beckett : Not that?
Beckett : No, I mean, not only that.
UNK: It's 2 : 00.
Beckett : I'm in my PJs. We're reading the newspapers.
Beckett : I never get to do this.
Castle : Because you never take any time off.
UNK: All we have to do is loaf around. There's no work.
Beckett : No goals other than to waste hours on end.
Castle : Okay, stop describing my life.
Castle : So, there is one thing we should get done today.
Castle : We need to pick a font for our "Save the Date" cards.
UNK: Really? We're gonna do that?
