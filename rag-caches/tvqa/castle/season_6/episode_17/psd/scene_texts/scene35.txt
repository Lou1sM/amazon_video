UNK: Both playing in a world where you don't belong.
UNK: SHOUTS
UNK: GROANS
UNK: Your mama paid for it with her life.
Simmons : So will you.
Simmons : But first...
UNK: GRUNTING
Simmons : Tell me what I want to know.
UNK: PANTING
UNK: No.
UNK: No!
UNK: Yo, just got off with the carrier.
UNK: Any idea whose phone it is?
Esposito : It's a pre-paid. There's no way to identify the owner.
UNK: - BEEPS - HASTINGS : I got a hit.
Tory : The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.
GATES : Great.
Gates : Can you lock on the location?
Tory : No, the message pinged off a single tower.
Tory : Without a second or third tower,
Tory : there's no way to narrow it down.
Tory : Depending on signal strength,
UNK: it could've originated anywhere within this 10-mile radius.
Esposito : It'd be easier to find a needle in a haystack.
Castle : Can you ping the GPS?
Tory : It's off and it looks like the phone's off as well.
Tory : I'm sorry. I've got no other way to trace it.
Tory : That's the best I can do.
SIMMONS : I know your lungs are burning.
Simmons : I can feel the panic in your soul.
Simmons : All you want is for this to end.
Simmons : And I promise, I will end it.
Simmons : Just tell me what I want to know.
