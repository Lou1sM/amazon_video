UNK: Fowler voiceover : and you'll be out in no time.
UNK: ELEVATOR BELL DINGS
Harden : - Hello. - Hi.
Harden : Which floor?
Beckett : SIGHS Eleven.
UNK: Okay.
Harden : Don't move a muscle.
UNK: ELEVATOR BELL DINGS
UNK: Elevator just got to 11.
UNK: Plainclothes Officer : It's empty. She's not here. She is not here.
UNK: SCREAMS
Beckett : This is Detective Kate Beckett
UNK: and if you can hear me, I've been abducted.
Beckett : I'm in a white cube van, New York plates.
Beckett : We've been traveling for about 20 minutes.
Beckett : We've been making a lot of turns, but I think we're headed east.
Beckett : Captain Fowler, if you can hear me,
Beckett : this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.
Gates : You promised me that you had her back, what happened?
Fowler : We were set up for a simple meet,
Fowler : not an orchestrated kidnapping.
Gates : The security cameras, did they get a shot of who did this?
Fowler : They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.
Gates : What about the mic Beckett had on?
Fowler : We stopped receiving audio after she got in the elevator.
Fowler : The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.
Gates : And let me guess,
Gates : whoever was in room 1123 didn't know about a meeting
UNK: because there never was gonna be one.
Fowler : Look, we've issued a limited alert.
Fowler : Limited alert? We need to call in the cavalry here.
Fowler : We know the drug ring tracks police radios.
Fowler : Sending up a flare could make things worse.
UNK: They must've known that your girl rolled on them,
Gates : or they made Beckett.
Gates : Either way, she's dead
Gates : if we don't find her immediately.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
Gates : Gentlemen, we have a situation.
Beckett : We've been driving for about an hour now, maybe more.
UNK: Uh, a two-lane road. Not a lot of traffic.
Beckett : We're slowing down.
Fowler : We stopped.
UNK: I gotta get rid of this thing.
MAN : Get on your knees
UNK: and face the wall towards the cab.
Harden : Do not move.
Harden : Don't turn around.
UNK: GASPS
Harden : Time to see if you're wearing a wire.
Beckett : I'm not wearing a wire.
Harden : We'll see about that.
UNK: DEVICE BEEPS
UNK: SLOW BEEPING
UNK: BEEPING CONTINUES
UNK: ON VOICEMAIL : This is Detective Kate Beckett,
UNK: Beckett voicemail : I'm unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening,
UNK: Martha Rodgers : so I'm going to make myself scarce.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Oh, very nice.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : I'm off to a revival of Brighton Beach Memoirs.
UNK: Ha. Pray for me.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : What's the matter?
UNK: I can't get a hold of Beckett. I texted her, I left messages.
UNK: This isn't like her.
Martha : Maybe she got tied up at the precinct.
Martha : Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?
Castle : I called them both, it just goes straight to voicemail.
Castle : Something is not right.
UNK: INDISTINCT TALKING IN DISTANCE
