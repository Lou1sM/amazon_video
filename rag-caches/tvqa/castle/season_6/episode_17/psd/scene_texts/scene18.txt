BECKETT : Dear Rick,
UNK: Beckett voiceover : I don't know how much time I have, even to write this letter.
UNK: Beckett voiceover : What I do know now is that I'm in this.
UNK: And the only way I'm gonna make it
UNK: Beckett voiceover : out alive is to see this through.
UNK: Beckett voiceover : I'm sure everyone is looking for me
UNK: Beckett voiceover : and if they figure out I was here,
UNK: CSU is gonna search this house.
UNK: They're gonna look for blood, and they will find it.
UNK: Beckett voiceover : Which will lead them to this letter.
UNK: Babe, it's your letter.
UNK: And I hope you never have to read this,
