Potter : And that if I wanted to live,
Potter : I had to do exactly what she said.
Potter : And then she went to the kitchen and she came back
UNK: with ketchup and beet juice,
Potter : and she told me to lie as still as possible
UNK: and to hold my breath.
GATES : Mr. Potter,
Gates : did she say anything else about where she was?
Gates : Where they were keeping her?
Potter : Yeah, she said it was some kind of a compound.
Potter : She didn't know where,
Potter : but that she would try to get a message out soon.
Ryan : At least we know she's still alive.
FOWLER : This guy who was with her,
Fowler : - did you see his face? - No.
Potter : I had my head down.
Fowler : Do you have any idea why members
Fowler : of a drug ring would want you dead?
Potter : No, that's not my world.
Gates : You're an attorney at Tyre, Potter and Langston.
Gates : What kind of law do you practice?
UNK: It's mostly corporate.
Potter : Trust administration.
UNK: Did you do any criminal law?
Potter : No, none.
Castle : I hate this.
Castle : She's out there somewhere, has no idea how much danger she's in,
Castle : and I can't help her.
Esposito : No. You can't.
Esposito : But this is Beckett we're talking about.
UNK: She might be your fiancee, but she's also a damn good cop,
Esposito : so don't sell her short.
Esposito : She'll figure out a way to let us know what's going on.
Esposito : And when she does, we'll get her out.
