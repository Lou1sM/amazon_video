Jones : What you do best.
Jones : Kill him.
Jones : And make it clean.
HARDEN : We're here.
Beckett : Where's here?
Harden : All you need to know is that the target's in that house.
Beckett : - Is he alone? - Yeah, as far as I know.

UNK: GUN CLICKS
UNK: Well, he's gotta be important. Who is he?
Harden : He's the next name on the list.
Beckett : What does he do?
UNK: Now, why are you so curious, all of a sudden?
UNK: You ever hear of recon?
Beckett : I like to know what I'm walking into.
Beckett : Is he a cop?
Beckett : Is he a drug dealer? Are there guns in the house?
Beckett : Curiosity keeps me alive.
Harden : Guy's a civilian, a nobody.
Beckett : If he's a nobody, then why are we killing him?
Harden : Because they told us to.
UNK: Look, is there a problem here?
Beckett : Yeah, there's a problem. I don't work like this.
Beckett : I do my homework, I control the variables, and this is sloppy.
Harden : You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise.
UNK: I don't know, maybe I do, too.
UNK: Now...
UNK: Are you gonna kill him or what?
UNK: GUN COCKS
