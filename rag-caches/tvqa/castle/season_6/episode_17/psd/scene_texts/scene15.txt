GATES : Are you telling me that we can't trace Beckett's call?
UNK: It's a voice-over-Internet line fed through an anonymizer.
UNK: Okay.
Gates : Can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?
UNK: No. It was routed through the Ukraine, bounced all over Europe.
Esposito : These guys know security.
Gates : Captain, why did Beckett tell us
Gates : that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?
Fowler : I have no idea.
Gates : So, there's nothing about her that you haven't told us?
Fowler : Absolutely not. Every part of her story checked out.
Castle : - But... - But what?
Fowler : We didn't have enough time to go deep.
Fowler : Not with things moving this fast.
Fowler : We didn't even know Miss Markov until yesterday.
Gates : Well, maybe you didn't know her at all.
UNK: Looks like we can fix that. Hospital just called, she's conscious.
Gates : Go talk to her, get to the bottom of this.
Fowler : I'll go with you. She knows me.
UNK: Hey. PANTING
Castle : You guys have not been returning my calls.
Castle : Where's Beckett?
Gates : Mr. Castle, why don't you come into my office.
UNK: INDISTINCT TALKING IN THE DISTANCE
UNK: VEHICLE APPROACHES
UNK: Quickly.
Castle : Do we have any idea where she is?
Gates : Traffic cam footage caught a white van
UNK: headed away from the Widmark right when she was abducted.
Gates : We think she was in it and we're trying to track it down.
Gates : There are reasons for hope here.
Castle : I'd love to hear them.
Gates : First of all, they didn't make her as a cop,
Gates : they think she's Elena Markov,
Gates : which buys us time.
