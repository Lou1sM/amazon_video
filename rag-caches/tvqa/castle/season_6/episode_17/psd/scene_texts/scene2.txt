Beckett : I bet I could.
Castle : Yeah, I mean, you'd have to work pretty hard to win me over.
Beckett : Well, I'm prepared to do just that.
UNK: Because it's clear to me that what we both need right now

Castle : Yes, we do. That's so true.
UNK: - CELL PHONE RINGING - Oh!
Castle : And worst timing ever.
UNK: RINGING CONTINUES
UNK: GROANS
Beckett : - Beckett. - GATES : Detective.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : How soon can you get here?
Beckett : Uh, sir, I'm actually not on call today.
Gates : I'm aware of that, but something has come up
Gates : and I'm afraid it can't wait.
Beckett : Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.
Gates : One more thing, come alone.
Gates : Do not bring Mr. Castle.
UNK: Uh... Yes, sir.
Castle : So, what's Gates up to?
Castle : Aside from sabotaging our domestic bliss?
Beckett : - I don't know, but I gotta go. - Huh.
Castle : I don't suppose I could convince you...
UNK: - No. Yeah. - Yeah.
UNK: Yeah, don't worry. It's fine. Don't worry about it.
UNK: I'm fine. I'll do some writing,
