Beckett : Maybe no one was looking in the right place.
Beckett : Now, how well did you know Kim?
UNK: Well, I saw her every day at school.
Beckett : Anywhere else? Outside of class?
John : Her house sometimes. She tutored me.
Beckett : And were you at her house the day that she died?
John : No. Why?
Beckett : We were just wondering what your chemistry book was doing at her house.
John : I must have left it there. Or forgot it.
Beckett : And you never asked for it back?
Beckett : Kim was killed somewhere in the middle of your school term.
Beckett : Wouldn't you have needed it?
John : Well, I might've bought a new one.
John : It was a long time ago. I don't really remember.
John : Why does that matter?
Beckett : You know, it probably doesn't.
Beckett : Now, in your statement,
UNK: you said you were in your room at the time of Kim's murder,
Beckett : but you didn't hear her scream.
John : That's right.
Beckett : Did you hear any other unusual sounds that night?
John : Not that I can think of.
Beckett : What about the smoke alarm?
John : No, I did hear that.
Beckett : In Frank's trial testimony,
UNK: he never mentioned you coming down to the garage.
Beckett : So you were in your room the whole time the alarm was going off?
