Beckett : Their people wouldn't run your case evidence.
Beckett : But I found someone else that would.
UNK: Who?
UNK: Lanie Parish : It's Lanie. Put me on speaker.
Ryan : Yeah. Um...
Castle : You're on.
Lanie : Alexis, why on earth wouldn't you come to me directly?
Alexis : Lanie, I didn't know you could do...
Beckett : She convinced a contact at the lab to run evidence after hours.
Lanie : Now, we retested every swab taken from Kim's body 15 years ago.
Lanie : Everything listed in Pennsylvania's report came out in our report,
Lanie : with the exception of one thing.
Lanie : We found trace amounts of ammonium nitrate
Lanie : that their lab never picked up.
Lanie : Ammonium nitrate?
Lanie : It's an oxidizing agent commonly found
UNK: in cold packs, explosives, fertilizer.
Alexis : Fertilizer? Wait.
Maggie : Lyle Gomez. Kim's ex-boyfriend.
Alexis : He used to work at a gardening store.
Alexis : Dad, it's him. That's why he wouldn't speak with us.
