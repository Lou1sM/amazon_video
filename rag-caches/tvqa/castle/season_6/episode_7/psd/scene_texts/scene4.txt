UNK: And what if I was? Would that be so bad?
Alexis : I just thought you were here for the case.
UNK: Richard Castle : I am.
Alexis : How come you haven't asked a single question about it since we left?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Um, so what do I need to know?
Alexis : Frank Henson, the accused. We're meeting him at the prison.
UNK: He's Pennsylvania blue-collar,
Alexis : struggled through high school, but he's smart.
Alexis : He earned his automotive mechanic degree in '95.
Alexis : He's a little rough around the edges, but he's got a good heart.
Alexis : - Okay. - Oh, and...
Alexis : - Then there's Maggie. - Who's Maggie?
Alexis : Maggie Ingram, the love of his life. She'll be at the prison, too.
UNK: "Love of his life"?
UNK: Is it one of those prison pen pal romance things?
Alexis : Dad, no. She's his high school sweetheart.
Alexis : He proposed to her two weeks before his arrest.
Castle : And she stayed with him?
Alexis : She's been by his side the whole time.
Alexis : Every hearing, every appeal.
Alexis : She's the one who wrote to the Innocence Review
Alexis : every week for three years to get us involved.
Castle : You know, Alexis, uh...
Castle : This is a long shot. You know that, right?
Castle : I mean, it may not work out the way you hope.
UNK: Look, I just don't wanna...
UNK: I just don't wanna see you hurt.
Alexis : Dad, I know these people.
Alexis : I care about them.
Alexis : It already hurts.
UNK: DOOR BUZZING
UNK: Alexis. Thank God.
Alexis : - Maggie, this is my dad. - Hi.
Maggie : Mr. Castle, thanks for coming.
UNK: I'd almost given up till Alexis called.
UNK: Oh...
Maggie : Hey, baby.
Frank : Hey, sunshine.
UNK: So what is this, a going-away party?
Maggie : - No. They came back to help. - Help how?
Frank : I lost the appeal. It's over, isn't it?
Maggie : No, it's not over. Not yet.
UNK: This is Mr. Castle, Alexis' father.
UNK: Hey.
Frank : Nice to meet you, Mr. Castle.
Frank : Your girl's one in a million. You should be proud.
Castle : Oh, I am.
UNK: So, you some kind of lawyer?
Castle : Oh, no.
Frank : You a cop?
UNK: No. I'm a mystery writer.
Maggie : He's more than that.
Maggie : He's helped the NYPD crack their biggest cases.
UNK: Well, I don't wanna oversell it.
Frank : You ever save a guy on death row?
UNK: No.
Alexis : But my dad's a genius at uncovering the real story.
Alexis : Frank, I know you've been through this more times than you can stomach,
Alexis : but if you can, tell him what happened that night.
UNK: Frank.
Frank : I was working on my Camaro.
