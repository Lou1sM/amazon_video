Alexis : he wouldn't have gotten off with a slap on the wrist.
UNK: And that's motive for murder.
Alexis : We need to talk to John.
Castle : According to this, he lives in Manhattan.
BECKETT : Thank you for coming in, Mr. Henson.
John : Anything for Frank.
John : Of course, at this point, he needs a miracle.
John : I've always supported my brother.
John : I never wanted to think he could've hurt Kim.
John : If someone else did this, why haven't they been found by now?
Beckett : Maybe no one was looking in the right place.
Beckett : Now, how well did you know Kim?
UNK: Well, I saw her every day at school.
Beckett : Anywhere else? Outside of class?
