UNK: I'd spend every waking hour with it back then.
Alexis : That night, I was working on the exhaust system.
UNK: - My house alarm went off. - ALARM BLARING
Frank : I was doing some welding, and the smoke set off the garage alarm.
UNK: The code is "Stingray-seven."
Frank : It's off now. Thank you.
UNK: DISTANT SCREAMING
UNK: Frank voiceover : That's when I heard the screams across the street.
UNK: Frank voiceover : I ran over to see what happened.
UNK: Hello?
Frank : Is everyone all right?
UNK: Frank voiceover : Back door was open, so I went inside.
UNK: Frank voiceover : She was lying there.
UNK: The blood was...
UNK: Frank voiceover : Whatever happened, I was too late.
UNK: Frank voiceover : I heard the sirens, and I panicked. I knew how it would look.
UNK: Frank voiceover : So I took a rag and tried to wipe down all my prints.
UNK: Frank voiceover : But I ran out of time.
UNK: I had her blood on me, a police record.
Frank : It went the way you'd expect.
Castle : And what about your home security company?
Castle : - Did they have a record of your call? - ALEXIS : Yes.
Alexis : But the prosecution argued it still left plenty of time.
Castle : How well did you know Kim Tolbert?
UNK: Not that well. Her mom and her had lived there a few years,
UNK: and Kim would flirt with me a little bit.
Frank : I was friendly, but that was it.
Maggie : They entered her diary into record.
Maggie : She wrote that she had a crush on Frank.
Maggie : So the prosecutor made Frank out to be some kind of predator.
Castle : And you didn't see anyone as you ran to the house?
UNK: No. They must've bolted out the back before I got there.
Castle : Well, what about back then?
Castle : Anybody she was having a problem with?
Maggie : Lyle Gomez, Kim's high school ex-boyfriend.
Maggie : They had a very stormy relationship.
Maggie : Plus, she dumped him a week before she was killed.
