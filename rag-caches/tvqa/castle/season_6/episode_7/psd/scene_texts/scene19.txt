Beckett : And were you at her house the day that she died?
John : No. Why?
Beckett : We were just wondering what your chemistry book was doing at her house.

Beckett : Kim was killed somewhere in the middle of your school term.
Beckett : Wouldn't you have needed it?
John : Well, I might've bought a new one.
John : It was a long time ago. I don't really remember.
