ALEXIS : Oh, there he is.
Castle : All right, that does not bode well.
UNK: STUTTERING Whoa, whoa...
Castle : - Where do you think you're going? - To talk to him.
Castle : Whoa, Alexis, no. Absolutely not.
UNK: He just gave us a none-too-subtle hint.
UNK: He was looking at you, Dad.
Alexis : He won't talk to you, but I can reach him.
Castle : The man is a possible murder suspect.
Alexis : He won't do anything with you here.
Castle : But what makes you even think he's gonna open the door to you?
Alexis : I'm a teenage girl. I'll remind him of Kim.
Castle : - No, I'm not... - I am not asking for permission.
Castle : I'll be watching you like a hawk.
