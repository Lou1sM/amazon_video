UNK: So?
Castle : So that's far too cold for Kim to have left the door open.
Castle : Yet, according to Frank, it was open.
Castle : Presumably because someone else committed the crime.
Alexis : Yeah, but everyone thinks he's lying.
Castle : Yes, but what they don't see, what no one sees,
Castle : is that we can prove whether or not he was lying.
Beckett : Come on. I'll get the car, you pay the check.
UNK: Wait. Dad?
UNK: Come on, Dad. Will you please tell me what you're doing?
Castle : If Frank is guilty, then he would've opened the back door.
