Lyle : She wanted me to pick her up from Jasper Grove.
Alexis : Jasper Grove? What's that?
UNK: Farmland and woods, east of town. Kids party there.
UNK: She must've gone to one, which surprised me
Lyle : because she barely ever drank.
Alexis : But Kim broke up with you, right?
Alexis : So why'd she call you?
Lyle : She said I was the only one that she could trust.
Lyle : - She was upset. - About what?
Lyle : She didn't say.
Lyle : I figured somebody hit on her.
Lyle : Anyway, she asked me to drive her home, so I did.
Alexis : What happened then?
Lyle : I was hoping that her calling meant she'd give me another chance.
