Alexis : for killing his neighbor, a high school girl,
Alexis : but he didn't do it, and they're about to execute him for it.
Castle : How do you know he didn't do it?
Alexis : For one thing, he had rotator cuff surgery four months before.
Alexis : He couldn't have swung the fireplace poker used to kill the victim.
UNK: Well, under the rush of adrenaline,
Castle : you'd be surprised at what people are capable of.
Alexis : You sound just like the prosecutor.
Alexis : But there's more.
Alexis : They found fresh tire tracks in the dirt outside the victim's back door.
Alexis : Bicycle treads.
Castle : And Frank didn't own a bike?
Alexis : No, he was 24 then. He worked on cars.
Alexis : Wait. How do you know his name?
Castle : - You just said it. - No, I didn't.
Alexis : You know about the case. How?
UNK: Yeah. How?
UNK: I must've seen the file on Esposito's desk.
Alexis : You've been checking up on me.
Castle : No! No.
Castle : Well, a little, yes.
Alexis : You're unbelievable.
Castle : I couldn't help it. You're my daughter.
Castle : I'm interested in your life, but you won't return my calls.
Alexis : So, did you find anything? In the file, anything that can help.
