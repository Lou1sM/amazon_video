UNK: Yes?
Castle : What are the names?
CASTLE : Chief Lane.
Castle : Can I help you?
Castle : No, Chief. But we can help you.
Castle : This little dolphin pendant was found
Castle : in Kim Tolbert's living room the night she died.
Castle : Underneath her body.
UNK: So?
Alexis : So it's not hers.
UNK: Officer Lane : You people are unbelievable.
Alexis : Officer Lane, how old were you when Kim died?
UNK: Officer Lane : - Excuse me? - You were in her class.
UNK: In fact, she tutored you, didn't she?
UNK: Chief Lane : What's this all about?
Castle : Checks you wrote to Kim Tolbert, Chief.
Castle : To pay for your son's tutoring.
UNK: Chief Lane : He needed some help keeping his grades up.
UNK: Yeah, I bet because of swim team.
Castle : You guys took state that year.
Castle : It was big news.
UNK: Chief Lane : Teddy, what's going on here?
Alexis : The night Kim Tolbert was murdered, she was in Jasper Grove,
Alexis : near a farmhouse you had foreclosed on a year earlier.
Alexis : That house was later found
Alexis : to be contaminated with methamphetamine residue.
Castle : We believe your son was one of the people who contaminated it.
Castle : We also believe he wanted to be
Castle : tutored in chemistry so he could learn how to cook meth.
UNK: Officer Lane : This is ridiculous.
Castle : But Kim caught on to you, and that was bad for business.
Castle : So when she left that party, you followed her.
ALEXIS : We found ammonium nitrate on her body.
Alexis : I'd be willing to bet
Alexis : that the tire treads outside the farmhouse
Alexis : are going to be a match to the bike treads behind Kim's house
Alexis : the night of her murder.
Alexis : And then, of course, there's that.
