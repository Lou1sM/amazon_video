John : Why does that matter?
Beckett : You know, it probably doesn't.
Beckett : Now, in your statement,
UNK: you said you were in your room at the time of Kim's murder,
Beckett : but you didn't hear her scream.
John : That's right.
Beckett : Did you hear any other unusual sounds that night?
John : Not that I can think of.
Beckett : What about the smoke alarm?
John : No, I did hear that.
Beckett : In Frank's trial testimony,
UNK: he never mentioned you coming down to the garage.
Beckett : So you were in your room the whole time the alarm was going off?
John : Yes, I was.
Beckett : Now, I find that odd, Mr. Henson.
Beckett : Because the security company logs
Beckett : show that the alarm sounded for a full two minutes and 47 seconds.
Beckett : But you stayed in your room that whole time.
Beckett : Never got up to check and make sure that the house wasn't burning down?
Beckett : You never heard the alarm going off, did you?
Beckett : Because you weren't in your house.
John : What are you saying? That I killed Kim? That I did it?
Beckett : Where were you that night?
John : SCOFFS I'm not answering any more of your questions.
FRANK : What is this, guys? I thought we were done.
Beckett : Mr. Henson, we've uncovered some new evidence.
Castle : Evidence that suggests someone else killed Kim Tolbert.
