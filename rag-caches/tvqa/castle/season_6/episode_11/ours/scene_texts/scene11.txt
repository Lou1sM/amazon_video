Castle : Then he blows the place, and everyone thinks he's been killed.
Gates : What better way to cover his tracks than disappear in a fire?
UNK: But it only works if there's another way out of that room.
Gates : And the only one to know that would be our arsonist.
Castle : We need to find him.
UNK: Sir, I've got something.
Burton : I went back through the Pyrolicious website.
UNK: Six of their videos are of fires attributed to our arsonist.
UNK: Each was uploaded to the site shortly after the buildings burned.
UNK: But here's the interesting part.
UNK: One website member logged in and viewed each of these videos
UNK: just minutes after they were posted. But only these videos.
Gates : That's him. He's checking out his work. What's this member's name?
Tori : I don't have his real name. Just a username. Firebug 4-4-7.
Gates : - Who is he? - I don't know.
Gates : The man has an account on your website.
Gates : You charge your users. How can you not know?
Milo : He paid with a cashier's check,
Milo : back when I was offering a lifetime membership. He mailed it in.
Gates : - You're lying. - I swear.
Milo : I only know his username, Firebug 4-4-7.
Gates : You listen to me.
Gates : I've got two officers about to burn.
Gates : Now if you know anything about this man, you are gonna tell me,
Gates : or I will bury you as an accessory to murder.
UNK: We'd chat sometimes. Over IM.
Gates : What would he say?
Milo : We'd talk about fire. How buildings burn.
Gates : Did he say anything that could help us identify who he is?
Milo : No. I'd sometimes ask.
UNK: But he was careful.
Milo : He did once say why he did it.
Milo : He said he couldn't deal with the suffering.
Milo : That sometimes sick and dying buildings need to burn
Milo : to be put out of their misery.
Beckett : And you're sure you don't see another way out?
Ryan : If there is, it's covered by debris.
Ryan : Any idea where that way out might be?
UNK: Castle's on with the phone with the Building Department.
UNK: He's trying to get a hold of the original blueprints.
Esposito : We're assuming there even is a way out.
Esposito : We're giving this guy more credit than he deserves.
UNK: EXHALES We're both getting sleepy. The carbon monoxide's building up.
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
Beckett : Ryan, you listen to me.
Beckett : You need to hang on, okay? They're coming for you.
UNK: I appreciate the pep talk,
Ryan : but we both know the fire's too hot
Ryan : and they don't know where to look.
Beckett : No. Ryan.
UNK: We're gonna lose the phone soon, Beckett,
UNK: so, there's something I need you to do.
UNK: LABORED BREATHING
UNK: Jenny.
UNK: What? What is it?
Beckett : - It's him. - It's Kevin?
Jenny : Is it you? It's really you?
Ryan : Yeah. Yeah, it's me, beautiful.
UNK: Jenny Ryan : Thank God!
Jenny : Where are you? The baby's coming.
Ryan : I'm inside.
UNK: Inside...
RYAN : Hon,
Ryan : I'm sorry. I know I promised, but
UNK: CLEARS THROAT I'm not gonna be there.
UNK: VOICE BREAKS Don't say that.
Jenny : Please don't say that.
RYAN : Sorry.
UNK: GROANS
UNK: EXHALES DEEPLY
Ryan : I love you more than anything.
UNK: Remember that. Always remember that.
UNK: SOBBING Kevin, please. No. Don't leave me.
UNK: CHUCKLES I don't want to.
Jenny : We need a name. For the baby. We need to do that together.
Ryan : If it's a boy,
UNK: "Javier."
JENNY : SNIFFLING And if it's a girl?
UNK: "Sarah Grace," after your grandmother.
Jenny : I love you so much, Kevin. I love you.
RYAN : I love you, too... STATIC
UNK: Kevin?
Jenny : Kevin? Kevin?
UNK: SOBBING
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
UNK: "Javier"?
UNK: You're gonna name a white Irish kid "Javier"?
UNK: What? You're gonna bust on me now
Ryan : for being sentimental?
Esposito : Figure it's my last chance.
UNK: LAUGHING
UNK: EXHALES No. No. No. We're getting out of here.
Ryan : There's a way out and we're gonna find it.
Ryan : I'm not leaving Jenny. I'm not leaving
UNK: my baby without a dad. All right?
UNK: Hey. Hey! Javi.
UNK: No, no, no. Javi!
UNK: No. No, no! Don't you dare fall asleep on me.
UNK: Don't you dare, Javi! Javi!
UNK: PANTING
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
UNK: I don't wanna do this, Lanie. Not without him.
Lanie : - I know, baby. - Ooh!
UNK: - I know. I'm here. I'm here. - Mmm...
Ryan : Contractions are two minutes apart. It's coming.
UNK: GROANS
UNK: We're gonna do it here. Together. Okay?
JENNY : Ow!
UNK: Detective!
Burton : We may have caught a break.
Burton : According to Milo Pavlik, our arsonist picked his targets
Burton : because the buildings were "sick and dying"
UNK: and "needed to be put out of their misery."
Burton : So I went back through the files,
Burton : all of the building inspector reports,
Burton : and he was right. Each of the targeted buildings had issues.
Burton : Structural defects, wiring problems, rot.
Castle : Okay, but how did our guy know that?
Beckett : He didn't just case the buildings.
Beckett : He spent time inside.
Burton : I think that's what Blake discovered. How he got onto this place.
Burton : Do you have those files that Ryan and Esposito found?
Castle : Yeah. Right here.
