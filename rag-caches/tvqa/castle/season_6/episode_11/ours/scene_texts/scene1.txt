UNK: Right.
UNK: Art Torino : I have no idea who he is.
UNK: Art Torino : Wasn't nobody supposed to be in there on account of the renovation.
Torino : Maybe the guy was a bum or a squatter or something.
Torino : But, hey, you know, human life, still a tragedy, right?
UNK: Mr. Turino, let's talk about why no one
Beckett : was there, not even a security guard.
Beckett : Wasn't your building basically abandoned
Beckett : after you stopped renovations three months ago?
UNK: Due to cash-flow problems?
Torino : Who are you again?
Castle : Just someone who couldn't help but notice
Castle : your bank required high levels of insurance on that building
Castle : as a condition of granting you the loan.
UNK: So?
UNK: So a total-loss insurance claim would
UNK: solve all of your cash-flow problems.
Castle : Right. The downside being, you'll go to prison for murder.
Torino : Are you kidding me? I wouldn't burn down my own building, okay?
UNK: Somebody else must've done it.
UNK: Tell me, Mr. Turino, are you involved in organized crime?
Torino : I take offense to that. Just because I'm Italian, I'm in the mob?
Beckett : No, I think you are in the mob
UNK: because you're a known member of the Maneri crime family
Beckett : and you also have convictions in racketeering, fraud, assault...
Torino : Yeah, okay, okay. I moved on. I'm out of the life now.
Torino : It was my dream to rehab that building
UNK: and flip it, and retire to Boca.
