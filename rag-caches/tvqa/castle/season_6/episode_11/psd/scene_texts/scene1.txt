Jenny : Kate? Kate, are you there?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
Jenny : What's going on?
Jenny : Where's Kevin?
Beckett : Jenny, I need you to stay calm, okay? Something's happened.
UNK: Richard Castle : Crime scene at a fire? Never done one of these before.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : After this, you might not want to.
UNK: The building was being rehabbed,
UNK: Kevin Ryan : so the place was supposed to be empty.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Guess our victim didn't get that memo.
Beckett : Do we know who our victim is?
UNK: - Uh, no... - CELL PHONE RINGING
Ryan : Oh, oh! Oh, my God.
Ryan : Oh, my God! It's Jenny. It's go time.
Ryan : Hi, Jenny. Are you having contractions? Are you...
UNK: Oh.
Ryan : No. No, it's good to double-check if my phone's working.
UNK: Or triple-check. Okay. All right, sweetie. Talk to you soon.
Ryan : - LAUGHS - False alarm.
Castle : What is she, two days past her due date?
Ryan : Three. So it could happen at any minute.
Ryan : Can you believe it? Me as a dad?
UNK: - No, Ryan, you're gonna be great. - SIGHS
Castle : You guys pick a name?
Ryan : No, we couldn't agree on one,
Ryan : so we're waiting to see if it's a boy or girl and then decide.
UNK: May I suggest WHISPERS "Cosmo"?
Ryan : No, you may not.
Ryan : And rather than pick a name for my kid,
Ryan : you should pick a date for your wedding.
UNK: Pick a date for my wedding? I was planning on bringing her.
Beckett : Really? When is that? I might have plans.
UNK: Oh.
MAN : Hey.
UNK: Mark Kimball : I'm Mark Kimball, Building and Safety.
UNK: Do you guys really need to be in here?
Beckett : It's where our crime scene is.
Kimball : Ah. Well, don't stay any longer than you have to.
Kimball : Fire did structural damage. I need to clear the building.
Ryan : We should be in and out.
Beckett : - Okay. - BECKETT : Thanks.
UNK: CAMERA CLICKING
BECKETT : So, do we know who the victim is?
UNK: Nope. If the dude had a wallet, it was burned to a crisp.
Ryan : Even if he was a dude. It's even hard to tell that.
Castle : I see what you mean.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Actually, he is a dude. Which is about all I can tell you right now.
Beckett : Is that a bullet hole?
UNK: Probably a.9. So needless to say,
Lanie : this wasn't from natural causes.
WOMAN : Neither was the fire.
RYAN : This is Lieutenant Delia Burton.
UNK: She's a fire investigator with FDNY.
Ryan : Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.
Beckett : Nice to meet you. So this was arson?
Burton : Well, it's looking that way.
Burton : I found miniscule traces of accelerant at the flashpoint.
Castle : So the killer set the fire to cover up the murder?
Burton : Except there's no accelerant on the body,
UNK: and the fire's flashpoint is deep in the building.
Burton : Normally when you're disposing of a body,
UNK: you're gonna make sure it burns.
Beckett : So maybe our victim surprised the arsonist.
