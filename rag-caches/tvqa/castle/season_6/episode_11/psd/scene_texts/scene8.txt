Castle : was to write down your name.
Ferguson : Not because I killed him.
UNK: It must've been the Phantom. I don't know his real name.
Castle : How do you know about him at all?
Ferguson : Blake told me.
Ferguson : He called me, asked me to meet him in some deli in the Village.
UNK: He was all stalled up about catching this Phantom guy.
Ferguson : He asked for my help and I said I'd give it to him.
Castle : Even though he put you in prison?
Ferguson : Blake paid me for my time.
