Burton : Structural defects, wiring problems, rot.
Castle : Okay, but how did our guy know that?
Beckett : He didn't just case the buildings.
Beckett : He spent time inside.
Burton : I think that's what Blake discovered. How he got onto this place.
Burton : Do you have those files that Ryan and Esposito found?
Castle : Yeah. Right here.
Kimball : The building inspection reports, who signed them?
CASTLE : Uh, Mark Kimball.
UNK: EXHALES
Burton : All of these files, each one, they have one thing in common.
Burton : The building inspector was Mark Kimball.
Castle : That's how he got inside the buildings, operated without being seen.
Castle : It was his job.

Beckett : That's how he was able to change
Beckett : building plans without anyone knowing.
CASTLE : If he's the arsonist, we have to find him.

Beckett : Kimball, don't move.
Beckett : The basement. Is there a way out?
Ferguson : Is there?
Kimball : I don't know what you're talking about.
UNK: The hell you don't.
Beckett : Is there a way out?
Beckett : Those guys in there, they are my friends.
Beckett : If they die, you die.
UNK: What's it gonna be?
Beckett : It's your choice.
