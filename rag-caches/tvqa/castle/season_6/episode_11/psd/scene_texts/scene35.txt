Beckett : And you're sure you don't see another way out?
Ryan : If there is, it's covered by debris.
Ryan : Any idea where that way out might be?
UNK: Castle's on with the phone with the Building Department.
UNK: He's trying to get a hold of the original blueprints.
Esposito : We're assuming there even is a way out.
Esposito : We're giving this guy more credit than he deserves.
UNK: EXHALES We're both getting sleepy. The carbon monoxide's building up.
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
Beckett : Ryan, you listen to me.
Beckett : You need to hang on, okay? They're coming for you.
UNK: I appreciate the pep talk,
Ryan : but we both know the fire's too hot
Ryan : and they don't know where to look.
Beckett : No. Ryan.
UNK: We're gonna lose the phone soon, Beckett,
UNK: so, there's something I need you to do.
UNK: LABORED BREATHING
UNK: Jenny.
