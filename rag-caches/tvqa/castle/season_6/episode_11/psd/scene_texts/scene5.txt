UNK: - Yo, Beckett. - Yeah.
UNK: So Art Turino's alibi checks out.
Esposito : He was at the Pink Palace gentlemen's club last night,
Esposito : stuffing G-strings from 8 : 00 p.m. To 4 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : But that doesn't mean he's in the clear.
UNK: Turino wouldn't do this himself.
Esposito : I'll see if anyone he's been hanging
Esposito : with has any connection to arson.
Beckett : Okay, I'll grab Castle. We'll see
Beckett : if Lanie's got anything new on our Vic.
Lanie : Still no ID and he's not in any missing persons report.
Beckett : We get a match on the bullet?
Lanie : It's not in the system.
Lanie : But the cause of death was definitely a GSW to the head.
Lanie : No smoke in the lungs, so he was
UNK: already dead before the fire got going.
UNK: Well, beats getting roasted alive.
Lanie : I'm right there with you.
Lanie : Also he was healthy, muscular, his teeth were in good shape.
Lanie : So he probably wasn't homeless.
Lanie : Plus, he had great medical care.
Beckett : How can you tell?
Lanie : He had a fractured leg that was splinted with metal plates and screws.
Lanie : Quality work, too.
Castle : - Can the plate be traced? - I'm already on it.
DELIA : Was it the left leg?
Burton : Anterior femur, midway down?
Lanie : That's right. How did you know?
Burton : I know who he is.
Burton : He's a fire investigator named Blake McCann.
Burton : He was my partner.
UNK: Okay. Got it, Lane.
