Ferguson : That's what he lives for.
Ferguson : Which is why, with every fire he sets, he is there watching.
GATES : What do you make of his story?
UNK: The staff at the deli where he said he met with McCann
UNK: remember seeing them.
CASTLE : Look, there's no way to really know what they talked about.
UNK: McCann could've accused him of being the Phantom.
Gates : Maybe he is the Phantom.
Beckett : We don't have anything that links him
Beckett : to any of the arsons yet, so...
Gates : Dig into his alibi and associates,
UNK: see if you can find anything that's solid.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : One thing about his story that does ring true on a character level
Castle : is about how the arsonist watches his own fires.
Beckett : Yeah, well, I've got unis canvassing the fire scene
Beckett : and checking into all the security cameras in the area
UNK: for anyone that was hanging out.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGING
Ryan : - Beckett. - Yo.
Esposito : Found McCann's car. It was parked two blocks from the fire
Esposito : and there was something inside.
Beckett : Arson files?
UNK: Nah, looks like a couple of files that he put together himself.
UNK: One's about the building that he was burned up in.
