BECKETT : Then that friend is our killer.
UNK: POP MUSIC PLAYING
Beckett : Mind if I cut in?
UNK: Principal Dunnan, what's going on?
UNK: I should ask you two that.
Dunan : We found these inside your lockers, hidden under a false bottom inside.
Dunan : Care to explain?
Beckett : Let me help you.
Beckett : It's all stolen property from thefts connected to Madison Beaumont.
Beckett : The two of you were partners in her little bling ring.
Castle : At least Madison was smart enough not to hide her stolen stash in her locker.
Hillary : I don't know what you're talking about. I've never seen that stuff before.
Beckett : I think you have. We've matched each one of those items
Beckett : to property that was stolen from families that have students enrolled here.
UNK: And we matched your movements
Castle : to the times when the burglaries were committed.
Dunan : It's bad enough you stole, but from the Faircroft community?
