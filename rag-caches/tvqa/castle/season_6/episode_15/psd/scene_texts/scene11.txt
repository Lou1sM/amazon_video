UNK: Ms. Payban : She wouldn't throw that away. She just wouldn't do this.
Hillary : Yeah, it was totally Jordan.
Kris : No doubt.
UNK: But you never actually saw her.
Kris : Well, we didn't see anyone.
UNK: It was as if some invisible force
Kris : threw Madison around the room like a rag doll.
Hillary : The same way Jordan attacked us in the cafeteria.
Castle : After you knocked into her as she carried a tray full of food.
Kris : Look, we know it was wrong of us to mess with her, but...
Hillary : I mean, she's odd, you know.
Hillary : She's into weird stuff.
Esposito : - Comic books? - Yeah.
Ryan : Found them all over Jordan's room.
Esposito : Big deal. She's an X-Men fan.
Ryan : - Maybe because she's one of them. - SCOFFS
Ryan : Check it out.
UNK: Telekinesis Unleashed, Developing Telekinetic Powers.
Ryan : Telekinesis for Beginners.
UNK: And then there's this.
Esposito : Come on, bro. Let's be serious.
Ryan : Yeah. Is this serious enough for you?
Esposito : That's our victim.
Ryan : I found it taped over Jordan's desk.
Esposito : Was she always into this stuff?
UNK: Ms. Payban : No. It started a few weeks ago.
UNK: Ms. Payban : She asked for an advance on her allowance
UNK: Ms. Payban : and then went and bought all these books.
UNK: Why?
Esposito : What about Jordan's friends?
Esposito : Would they know where she is?
UNK: Ms. Payban : She doesn't have a lot of friends.
UNK: Ms. Payban : She spends most of her time in front of her computer.
