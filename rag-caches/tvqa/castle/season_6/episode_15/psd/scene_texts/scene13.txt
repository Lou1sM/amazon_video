UNK: Tech Agent Tori : Okay, so let's start with the cafeteria video.
UNK: Tech Agent Tori : There's no indication that Jordan Gibbs
UNK: Tech Agent Tori : or anyone else is moving the tables and chairs.
UNK: Tech Agent Tori : Frankly, I can't explain what we're seeing here.
Castle : Well, I think I can offer an explanation...
Beckett : What about the FaceTime call made to Madison's friends?
Beckett : Is there any way to retrieve that?
Tori : A video call is like a phone call.
Tori : Unless someone's recording it, once the call ends, the data is gone.
Tori : As for Jordan's laptop,
Tori : browser history suggests she spent hours
Tori : obsessing on all things telekinesis, starting two weeks ago.
Castle : Right about the time she telekinetically rearranged the cafeteria.
UNK: Clearly, Jordan realized she had powers
Castle : and was trying to understand them.
Castle : This is exactly like the movie Carrie.
Beckett : Yes. Exactly like the movie, fictional.
