Esposito : Muscular, maybe. Do you know of anybody in her life...
Madison : Oh, my God. Charles, what about Riley?
Esposito : Who's Riley?
UNK: Mrs. Beaumont : Riley Mitchum. Her ex-boyfriend.
UNK: Mrs. Beaumont : Madison broke up with him last month. He didn't take it well.
BECKETT : Riley Mitchum. According to the Faircroft football website,
UNK: he's 6'2" and 210 pounds.
Beckett : There's your Hulk, Castle.
UNK: Though murder is at odds with the values instilled in a Faircroft man.
Castle : I haven't been back here since I was a senior.
Beckett : So this is where you graduated, huh?
Castle : Well, I would have, if it wasn't for the fact
Castle : that one night, my buddies and I sneaked in
UNK: and pushed a cow up 12 flights of stairs, onto the roof.
UNK: - BECKETT : A cow? Really? - Yep.
Beckett : So, what happened? Did you guys get expelled?
Castle : No. Just me. I wasn't connected like my buddies were.
Castle : I was the scholarship kid, so I got the boot.
UNK: Well, I think you turned out all right.
Castle : Me, too.
UNK: Riley Mitchum : Man, this is awful. Madison was, like, my first love.
Beckett : It must have hurt when she broke up with you.
UNK: Wait, you guys got it all wrong. I broke up with her.
Beckett : Not according to her mom.
Riley : Her parents didn't have a clue, okay?
UNK: A couple of months ago,
Riley : Madison started going out at all times of the night.
Riley : She wouldn't tell me what she was up to.
Castle : Was she seeing someone else?
UNK: I just figured she had to be, but I never found out who.
Beckett : Where were you last night?
Riley : I was with my new girl.
Riley : You can ask her.
UNK: Okay, well, I'm gonna need a name to confirm that. Excuse me.
RYAN : Hey, Beckett.
Beckett : Hey, Ryan, I need you to check into Madison's phone records
Beckett : and recent activity.
UNK: Look for anyone new in her life.
Ryan : You got it.
Ryan : Meantime, we located that cabbie.
