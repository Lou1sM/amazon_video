Beckett : Jordan doesn't have powers.
UNK: Hey, got Jordan's phone records.
Esposito : Her service provider says that her phone's been turned off,
Esposito : but she made one call right when she ditched school.
Beckett : To whom?
Esposito : Number's listed to a Henderson Diagnostics.
Esposito : And I can't find any info on what they do, exactly,
Esposito : but when I called, there was no answer. No voicemail or message either.
Beckett : Did you get an address?
UNK: Yeah. Brooklyn. Off the 4l5 line.
Beckett : What was Jordan doing all the way out here?
UNK: I mean, it's miles away from her house, the school.
UNK: Just because nobody knows who Jordan's friends are
Castle : doesn't mean she doesn't have any.
Beckett : And her friends hang out at a place like this?
