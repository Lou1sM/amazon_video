Kris : Look, two weeks ago, this thing happened in the cafeteria...
Hillary : Hey, the principal said we're not supposed to talk about it.
UNK: Javier Esposito : About what?
Hillary : You'll have to ask him.
Assistant : The principal will be with you in just a moment.
Beckett : Thank you.
Beckett : Castle, none of this adds up.
Beckett : What were those girls so afraid of? What happened in that cafeteria?
Castle : I'd offer a theory, but I'm too busy having detention flashbacks.
Beckett : You must have spent a lot of time in this hallway.
Castle : More than I did in class.
Beckett : Bet that principal hated you.
Castle : I'm wondering if hate's a strong enough word.
UNK: Principal Dunnan had to hire a crane to get that cow off the roof.
Castle : But I'm sure that old battle-ax has long since retired. CHUCKLES
