Jordan : Then I wished for Madison to be dead, and the next thing I knew, she was.
Jordan : It had to be me, right?
Beckett : Where were you between 8 : 00 and 10 : 00 p.m. Last night?
Jordan : I was studying at LuLu's CafÃ© in Astoria.
UNK: We're gonna have to kick her loose.
Esposito : Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the cafÃ© in Queens till 11 : 00.
Beckett : So she couldn't have killed Madison.
Castle : Not with her bare hands.
Castle : But who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach?
Ryan : Well, it turns out, our victim might have had some secrets of her own.
Beckett : Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?
Ryan : As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.
UNK: But these are her financials.
Esposito : What kind of high school kid has financials?
Ryan : Madison does.
Ryan : She had a dozen credit cards and she was wearing them out.
UNK: HermÃ©s handbags, Jimmy Choos.
UNK: We're talking tens of thousands of dollars.
Esposito : So what? Her parents are loaded.
Ryan : Yeah, but Mommy and Daddy weren't springing for any of this stuff.
Ryan : The cards were in Madison's name,
Ryan : paid off every month through her own secret bank account.
Beckett : So where was this money coming from?
Ryan : That's what we're trying to figure out.
Ryan : Plus, there's more.
Ryan : A slew of credit card charges for late-night cab rides
UNK: and convenience-store purchases.
Castle : That fits with what Madison's ex-boyfriend said
Castle : about her staying out to all hours.
Beckett : Okay. Maybe she was going out. Hitting the clubs.
Ryan : Yeah, but on weeknights?
Ryan : And there are no bar or club charges here.
Castle : And look at this.
Castle : Remember how Jordan said her troubles with Madison
Castle : began when school started back up, with that run-in at the library?
