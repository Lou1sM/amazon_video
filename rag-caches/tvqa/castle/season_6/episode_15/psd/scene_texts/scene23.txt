UNK: and that's the reason she died?
Ryan : We don't know, but we did find something else in the school library.
UNK: Inside of a hollowed-out book with your daughter's fingerprints all over it.
UNK: Mrs. Beaumont : What did you find?
UNK: $2.3 million in German bearer bonds.
Castle : Bearer bonds.
Esposito : Are these your bearer bonds, Mr. Beaumont?
UNK: Uh, no... No.
Ryan : Do you know where your daughter could've gotten them?
UNK: Charles?
UNK: No. I'm sorry. We can't help you.
UNK: Come on, Diane. We're done here.
UNK: No question Madison's dad knew about those bearer bonds.
Beckett : If they have something to do with his daughter's death,
Beckett : then why wouldn't he want to tell us about them?
Esposito : We're not going to know until we know where they came from.
UNK: We're tracking the serial numbers on the bonds,
Ryan : to see if we can locate the original owners,
UNK: but it's gonna take some time.
Beckett : What the hell was this girl mixed up in?
Castle : And what does it have to do with Jordan's telekinesis?
Beckett : Nothing, because Jordan is not telekinetic.
Castle : Well, explain that cafeteria video.
Beckett : I can't, Castle. But I assure you, I will.
Castle : And what about Madison's death?
UNK: Being thrown around like a rag doll by an unseen force.
UNK: "Unseen" doesn't mean that nobody was there.
UNK: The real question that we should be asking
UNK: is what is a 17-year-old doing with $2.3 million in bearer bonds?
Beckett : That probably got her killed, not some psychic assassin.
Castle : Perhaps we'll have to agree to disagree on that
Castle : and agree to agree on this.
UNK: "The Billboard's Top 100 Most Romantic Songs of All Time."
UNK: I figure our song has got to be on that list somewhere.
Beckett : No. Castle, I'm not choosing our song off of a list that includes
UNK: Def Leppard's Pour Some Sugar On Me.
UNK: Uh, that song, I'm sure, ignited many a strip club romance in 1987.
