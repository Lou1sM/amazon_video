Beckett : Now, has anything like this happened before?
UNK: No.
UNK: Um... Yes! At the crime scene.
Castle : This explains Madison's head wound, the blood on the rafters.

Beckett : Is there a history of trouble between Jordan and Madison?
Dunan : Not until recently.
Dunan : I heard a rumor that Madison and her friends were harassing Jordan.
