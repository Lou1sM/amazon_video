Lucas : You know what they would do
Lucas : to a scholarship kid who terrorized a room full of students?
UNK: What'd she ask you to do?
Lucas : There was a house in Westchester.
Lucas : And she said she needed to get inside.
UNK: And I was supposed to create a diversion to scare the owner out.
Beckett : Do you know what she was after in the house?
Lucas : No. No idea.
Lucas : I just wanted to do whatever she said so I could get on with my life.
Beckett : Which is why you killed her, because she wouldn't let you?
UNK: No... I didn't kill anybody.
Beckett : Lucas, Madison was on a FaceTime call when she was killed.
Beckett : Witnesses reported an invisible force tossing her around the room.
Beckett : They described it as a telekinetic event.
Beckett : Now, you just admitted to motive, and out of all of our suspects,
Beckett : you're the only one capable of pulling that off.
Lucas : Yeah. You're right, I did pull that off.
Ryan : With Madison.
