Castle : According to this taxi charge,
Castle : Madison was out and about that same morning at 5 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : Okay, so she was going straight to school from wherever she was.
Beckett : But why would she stay out all night and then go to the school library?
Castle : What was she doing that she didn't want Jordan to know about?
Librarian : Students use their IDs to swipe in and out of the library.
Librarian : These are all the times Madison Beaumont entered
Librarian : and exited during this entire school year.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Okay, so, each one of Madison's early morning visits to the library
Beckett : happened after one of her all-nighters.
Beckett : She swiped in and out within five minutes.
Castle : I'm guessing she wasn't hanging out in Russian lit to study.
Beckett : Castle, Russian literature. It's right here.
Castle : Thank God for the Kindle or I'd be out of a job in a couple of years.
Castle : Kids just don't read actual books anymore.
UNK: Unless it's Voyna i Mir.
UNK: War and Peace. In its original Russian.
Beckett : And look, there's no dust here.
Beckett : It's like someone pulled this out recently.
Beckett : It's lighter than I remember Tolstoy being.
UNK: Are these bank notes?
Castle : These are bonds. These are bearer bonds.
Castle : Issued by the German government.
Castle : These are payable to the bearer, no questions asked.
Beckett : German bearer bonds? I thought that only existed in Die Hard.
