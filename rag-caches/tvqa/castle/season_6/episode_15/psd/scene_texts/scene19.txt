Jordan : and she got all pissed,
Jordan : saying I couldn't tell anyone that I'd seen her there.
Castle : What was she angry about?
Jordan : I have no idea.
Jordan : Maybe she didn't want anyone to know that she actually studies.
Jordan : But then later that day,
Jordan : Madison started messing with me and it just got worse from there.
Beckett : So you pulled that stunt in the cafeteria to make her scared of you?
Jordan : I just wanted them to stop!
Beckett : Is that why you killed Madison?
Jordan : I guess so! I don't know!
UNK: RATTLING
Jordan : It's a nervous habit.
UNK: Jordan, there is no guessing here.
Beckett : Either you did or you didn't kill Madison.
Jordan : I got so angry
Jordan : and stuff just started flying around the cafeteria.
