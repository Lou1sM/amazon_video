Dunan : I reached out to her,
Dunan : but she said she would prefer handling things herself.
Castle : Well, if this is how she handles things, no wonder Kris and Hillary are scared.
Beckett : We need to speak with Jordan.
Dunan : I'll have her pulled from class.
UNK: I cannot wait to tell Stephen about this case.
UNK: Hmm?
Castle : Stephen King. He won't believe it.
UNK: A real-life Carrie.
Beckett : Castle, I can't say what happened in the cafeteria
UNK: or in Madison's bedroom yet.
Beckett : But I can say this.
Beckett : The animosity between those two girls
Beckett : is what makes Jordan a person of interest.
Beckett : And not your telekinetic fantasy.
Dunan : I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid that Jordan is gone.
Beckett : What do you mean, she's gone?
UNK: It seems a student in her class came in
UNK: and told everyone the NYPD was here asking about Madison.
Dunan : Jordan got very upset and left the campus.
Dunan : Her teacher just called to inform us.
UNK: Ms. Payban : Jordan's still not answering. It just keeps going right to voicemail.
UNK: Ms. Payban : You're sure she's not at my house?
Esposito : I sent my partner to check. She wasn't there.
UNK: Ms. Papen, did Jordan ever mention a Madison Beaumont to you?
UNK: Ms. Payban : No. Not that I can remember.
Esposito : Was she home last night?
UNK: No. She was out till after 11 : 00.
Esposito : Out where?
UNK: Ms. Payban : I don't know.
UNK: Ms. Payban : Look, my brother and his wife died in a car wreck and I took Jordan in.
