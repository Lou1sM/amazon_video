Rampinel : Most ungifted are.
Beckett : What can you tell us about Jordan Gibbs?
Rampinel : Ah, yes, Jordan.
Rampinel : She came by last week, I think, to have herself evaluated.
Castle : How did she do?
Castle : Let me guess. Off the charts.
Rampinel : I really can't discuss my findings.
Rampinel : Last week? But she called here this morning.
Rampinel : In fact, she did, yes.
Castle : And what did she say?
Rampinel : She was frightened.
Rampinel : You see, Jordan doesn't yet know how to control her powers.
Beckett : So did she come here to see you?
Rampinel : Yes, but she's gone now.
Beckett : You're lying.
Beckett : And if you don't tell me the truth, I will arrest you
Beckett : for obstruction and harboring a fugitive.
UNK: Stop.
Jordan : Leave him alone.
Jordan : He's just trying to protect me.
Ryan : She even kind of looks like Carrie.
Esposito : No, she does not.
Esposito : Besides, how would that little skinny girl throw Madison up against the ceiling?
Castle : With powers we have yet to comprehend.
