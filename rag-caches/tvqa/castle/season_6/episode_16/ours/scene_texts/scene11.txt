Bauer : For the therapy to work,
Bauer : we had to put subjects in a chemically-induced suggestive state
Bauer : while showing them this footage.
UNK: Uh, but it was just too real.
Bauer : They began to internalize the experience,
UNK: and then they started to believe they'd actually killed Justin.
Bauer : We halted the program immediately.
Beckett : But the damage was already done.
Bauer : They threatened to sue.
Bauer : They said we were using them as guinea pigs.
Castle : Which you were.
Bauer : We tried to help them.
Bauer : We brought them back for one final session to correct the problem.
Beckett : And by correcting, you mean dosing them with Propranolol,
Beckett : so that they would forget they ever visited EHI?
Bauer : We were just trying to help people.
Castle : Is that why you sent Madsen after Justin?
Castle : To help him?
Bauer : Madsen only talked with Justin,
Bauer : to remind him of the confidentiality agreement
UNK: that prohibited him from talking about the program.
Bauer : We knew nothing about his murder.
Castle : And yet his death was staged to mirror that video exactly.
Bauer : Why would we do that when we were just trying to make this go away?
Bauer : No. No, no, no, no. Someone is targeting us.
Bauer : Someone who knew about that tape and knew they could use it against us.
UNK: Uh, one of the other test subjects, someone on the crew.
UNK: I'm gonna need a list of all of the people that knew about that video.
PAM : Be sure not to step any further downstage,
Pam : or the backdrop will smack you in the head when it flies in.
EDDIE : Roger that.
Becket : Detective Beckett.
