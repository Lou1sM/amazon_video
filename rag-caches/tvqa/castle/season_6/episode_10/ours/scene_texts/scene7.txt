Beckett : Now, come on, let's go home.
UNK: - BABY CRYING - WOMAN : Shh, it's okay.
Sandra : It's okay, shh.
Sandra : Hush, hush, hush.
UNK: - Oh, no. What's wrong, Cosmo? - STOPS CRYING
Beckett : - You're still here? - Yeah.
Sandra : I've been trying to locate a foster family,
Sandra : but because it's Thanksgiving week, no one's available.
UNK: I'm gonna have to bring him to the County Crisis Center
Sandra : until I can find someone who can take him.
Castle : I thought you said there weren't any beds.
Sandra : When it's this crowded, they have to double up.
Castle : There's no other options?
Sandra : That's the only place that can take an infant.
Castle : Well, what if we take him?
Castle : Wait. What?
Castle : Well, we've already bonded. I got all the stuff.
UNK: WHISPERS No, no! Castle, I told you...
Castle : I know, I know, you haven't been around babies that much.
Castle : Not a big deal. I got this. I'm the Baby Whisperer.
Beckett : Look, she's not gonna just give you a baby.
UNK: I'm sure that there are background checks
Beckett : and forms that we have to fill out, right?
UNK: Not if the baby officially remains in the custody of the NYPD.
Sandra : And you guys have done SINGSONGY an amazing job so far.
Castle : What do you say, Beckett?
Castle : Wanna have a baby?
Castle : Come on, it'll be fun!
UNK: CRYING
UNK: WHISPERS Sorry.
UNK: EXHALES
UNK: COSMO CRYING
Castle : This is so not fun.
UNK: Castle, if this was a part of your plan
Beckett : to turn me into a baby person, it's not working.
Castle : It isn't. Well, it was at first, but he was so good at the precinct.
Beckett : I thought you were the Baby Whisperer.
Ryan : I am.
Castle : There's something wrong with this baby.
UNK: Ooh, okay, so it says here that
UNK: "gently bouncing your baby should calm him or her down."
Castle : - Okay, okay. Okay, okay. - CONTINUES CRYING
Beckett : I have an idea.
Castle : Shh, shh.
UNK: Okay... You're making me look bad, kid.
Castle : Anything you want, okay, buddy?
UNK: You just tell me what it is, I will give it to you.
Sandra : Okay. Shh.
Beckett : Okay, here.
Beckett : Sit. Bounce.
Castle : Okay, okay.

Castle : Hold him or he'll roll off.
Beckett : - Yes, yes. - CRYING
