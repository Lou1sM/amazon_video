Esposito : It's not their kid.
UNK: We've only been married for two years. We weren't ready for a baby.
Beckett : Could the baby be a friend's or a relative's?
UNK: Mrs. Ducane : No, I've never seen him before.
UNK: Lissa, I know this is hard,
Beckett : but is it possible that Cam had a baby outside of your marriage?
UNK: Mrs. Ducane : Absolutely not.
UNK: Mrs. Ducane : Cam told me everything. He wouldn't have kept a secret like that.
UNK: Okay. Where did he go this morning? Do you know what he was doing?
