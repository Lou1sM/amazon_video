Castle : Well, who knows? Maybe in a few Thanksgivings from now,
UNK: we'll have a couple of Bennys of our own running around.
Alexis : Hey, if you guys have kids in a few years
Alexis : and I have kids in a few years, they can grow up together.
UNK: And it's ruined.
Castle : The turkey will be, too, if I don't get it out of the freezer.
UNK: Come on! Ladies, chop-chop.
Castle : There we go.
Castle : - Ooh. - Oh, this is so exciting.
Martha : Our family is just growing by leaps and bounds.
Martha : If we keep this up, darling, we're gonna need a bigger table.
UNK: Exactly 20 minutes till turkey time.
Alexis : Pi is on his way, and Beckett's dad just called.
Alexis : He'll be here any minute.
Castle : Excellent. And where's Beckett?
MARTHA : Katherine, what on earth are you wearing?
UNK: My outfit.
Beckett : Your family tradition?
Castle : Yeah, uh...
Castle : You do know I was kidding WHISPERS about that, right?
Beckett : You know, I actually wasn't sure about that.
Beckett : So I figured if this isn't a Castle family tradition,
Beckett : then maybe it should be.
Beckett : Better put this on, pilgrim.
