UNK: Kate Beckett : Castle, I thought this was gonna be a small gathering. I mean...
UNK: Kate Beckett : There's enough food in here for, like, 50 people.
UNK: Richard Castle : Never underestimate the importance of leftovers.
UNK: Second-day stuffing, turkey soup,
UNK: microwaved yams and a visit to the food bank.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: And so that you know, Alexis always makes dessert.
Castle : Pi said he would make a cranberry concoction of some kind.
Castle : Even Mother cooks something.
Castle : It's not always edible.
MARTHA : IN DISTANCE I heard that!
Beckett : Well, you know what? I make a killer stuffing.
Beckett : And my dad makes a great traditional corn casserole.
Castle : Nice. And I know the perfect costume for you,
Castle : so you don't have to worry.
Beckett : A costume?
UNK: Yeah, I'm gonna be, uh, settler John Rolfe,
UNK: so you'll obviously be Pocahontas, his bride.
Castle : Alexis goes back and forth.
Castle : Sometimes she's Puritan, sometimes she's Native American.
Castle : Just depends on where she is in her life.
Castle : Your dad can be whichever. Nothing elaborate.
UNK: Uh, so you guys dress up for Thanksgiving?
Castle : Doesn't everybody?
Beckett : No, I think that's pretty special to you.
UNK: Um... So is there anything else I should know about you before we get married?
Castle : So many, many things.
UNK: CELL PHONE CHIMES AND BEEPS
Beckett : There's been a murder in a church downtown.
Castle : Oh. Too bad it wasn't in a cathedral. That would be so T. S. Eliot.
UNK: Huh?
UNK: Murder in the Cathedral? Thomas Becket? Becket and Beckett?
Beckett : Come on.
UNK: - Nothing? Anyone? - WHISPERS Let's go. Thank you.
Castle : When we do this, let's not do the dead body in the middle of the aisle.
UNK: Okay, good call. So what happened?
UNK: Well, our victim entered the church during 6 : 30 mass
UNK: with multiple gunshot wounds,
UNK: made his way towards the altar
UNK: - before collapsing. - CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING
UNK: Javier Esposito : But not before handing the priest
UNK: - a little something-something. - RYAN : Mmm.
UNK: COOING
UNK: GASPS A baby?
UNK: SINGSONGY A boy.
UNK: NORMAL VOICE I'm guessing he's about three months.
UNK: Lanie Parish : And he's hungry, 'cause he keeps going after the girls.
UNK: Well, who can blame him? Hi, buddy. What's your name, little man?
Lanie : That is a very good question.
Beckett : - So, is this the baby's father? - RYAN : We don't really know.
Esposito : But what we do know is his name is Cameron Ducane, 30.
Esposito : Lived in the Bronx. There's no baby pictures in his wallet.
Esposito : He's got a commercial driver's license, probably drives for a living.
Esposito : He's got a car wash coupon,
Esposito : and like Ryan,
UNK: spent his hard-earned money
Esposito : - on a lottery ticket. - SIGHS
UNK: That is the Five-State MagicBall jackpot.
UNK: At 247 million, you're crazy not buying a ticket.
UNK: Yeah, one or two. But not 50.
Ryan : I'm just increasing my odds of winning.
Esposito : Increasing your odds of being broke.
Ryan : Listen, do you have any idea what it costs raising a child in New York City?
Esposito : I don't know how much it costs. I wouldn't waste...
Beckett : - Guys. - That's right. Of course you don't.
UNK: Guys!
UNK: LOWERED VOICE How about we don't fight in front of the baby?
Beckett : Okay, contact Ducane's next of kin. Let's see if this little guy is indeed his.
Castle : And then what happens to him in the meantime?
UNK: Well, we'll get a hold of Child Services,
Beckett : and they'll place him until we're
Beckett : - able to get him back to his family. - BABY FUSSING
Castle : I think Lanie's right. I think he is hungry.
UNK: Um, how about you finish up here, I'll grab a uniform,
Castle : and we'll just go pick up some stuff for him?
UNK: You really wanna do that?
UNK: Of course. Highly qualified. I have an RHD in childcare.
Beckett : And an RHD is...
UNK: - "Ruggedly Handsome Dad." - Ah.
Beckett : Okay. Fine. Go.
CASTLE : Hey, buddy, let's go.
Castle : Don't look at her. Come on.
Castle : - We'll get ice cream. - BABY FUSSES
Beckett : Do we know where he was shot?
Esposito : Uniforms found it with the engine running
Esposito : and both doors wide open.
UNK: Someone fired at him from above, through the roof.
Beckett : That's a lot of blood.
UNK: - CELL PHONE RINGS - Notice what's missing?
UNK: - CELL PHONE BEEPS - There's no car seat.
Castle : - Yeah. - RYAN : Whatever happened,
Ryan : I don't think he planned on having a baby with him.
Beckett : And there's no way of telling how long he had been driving.
UNK: I mean, he could've been shot nearby.
Ryan : - Or miles away. - All right,
Beckett : have uniforms go through traffic cam footage.
Beckett : Let's see if we can figure out what direction this car was coming from.
Esposito : Yo. We found the victim's wife.
