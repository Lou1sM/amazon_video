UNK: Mrs. Ducane : Actually, yeah.
UNK: Mrs. Ducane : A couple of weeks ago, he started acting,
UNK: Mrs. Ducane : I don't know, paranoid.
UNK: Mrs. Ducane : He bought one of those home security systems
UNK: Mrs. Ducane : and he put extra locks on all of our doors.
Beckett : - Did he say why? - No, he just...
UNK: Oh, he said he just loved me,
UNK: VOICE BREAKS and that he just wanted me to be safe.
Beckett : This limo company, what's the name?
MAN : Cameron? Jeez, he was one of my best guys.
Roman : Nice, reliable, good soul. What happened?
Esposito : We were hoping you could tell us.
Ryan : We know he worked the overnight yesterday.
Ryan : What time did he finish his shift this morning?
Roman : He didn't. He was on the books to work last night, but he didn't show up.
Ryan : He do that a lot?
UNK: Nah. A year and a half here, that was his first time.
Beckett : You notice anything going on with him at work?
Beckett : Anything unusual?
Roman : Yeah, yeah. There was that guy that showed up last week.
UNK: Watch yourselves. Guys, bring it out. WHISTLES
Ryan : What guy?
Roman : Well, Cam said he was an old friend, right?
Roman : But they didn't look too friendly to me.
Roman : When Cam saw him, he went pale. So he stepped outside to talk.
Roman : And it sounded pretty heated.
Esposito : You know what it was about?
Roman : No, but I heard the guy say something about going to prison.
Roman : When Cam came back inside, he was rattled.
Roman : And before that guy left, he told Cam that he'd be coming back.
Ryan : This guy show up again?
UNK: Nah, but I got the feeling that Cam was scared of him.
Roman : Because, normally, he'd come back to the garage
UNK: for his 3 : 00 a.m. Lunch break, but since that guy showed up,
Roman : he'd be staying out all night like he was scared to come back here.
Ryan : This guy, can you describe him?
UNK: I really didn't get a look at his face.
