Beckett : You know, Castle, my mom had a saying.
Beckett : Vincit omnia veritas.
UNK: "Truth conquers all."
Beckett : We'll never find the truth if we run away.
UNK: Kate, we're never gonna find the truth if we're dead.
Castle : We're not running away. We are surviving, okay?
Castle : We're living to fight another day. We will take down Bracken.
UNK: First, we're gonna find a safe place and come up with a plan.
Castle : I've got a friend. He will give us a car, no questions asked.
Beckett : Okay, go.
Castle : I'll be back.
Castle : We'll be back.
UNK: DOOR CLOSES
UNK: CREAKING
UNK: Castle?
UNK: Senator William Bracken : Hello, Detective.
UNK: GUN COCKS
Thomas : Don't even think about it.
Sergio : Drop the scissors.
UNK: CLATTERS
Bracken : We had an agreement. A truce.
Bracken : Live and let live.
Bracken : I held up my end of the bargain. I even saved your life.
Beckett : And that makes up for what you took from me?
Bracken : What about what I gave to you?
Bracken : Everything you are, everything you've accomplished, is because of me.
UNK: Is that how you justify murder?
Beckett : It builds character?
Beckett : Then why don't you give me a chance to build yours?
Bracken : You had a future.
Bracken : Why couldn't you just let this go and move on so I could do the same?
UNK: SIGHS
Bracken : So I guess there's no point in asking for your vote, is there?
UNK: You're not gonna be on the ballot.
Beckett : A presidential campaign financed by drug money with a trail of dead bodies?
Beckett : There's no hole big enough to bury all of that.
UNK: I gotta tell you,
Bracken : part of me really admires you.
Bracken : Your moral certitude.
Bracken : The way you fight for what you believe in,
UNK: even knowing it's gonna destroy you.
Bracken : But the part of me that admires you
Bracken : is not the part that makes tough decisions.
UNK: Fine.
Beckett : Then kill me.
Beckett : Do it. Pull the trigger.
Bracken : I have people for that.
Beckett : I don't want them.
Beckett : I want you.
Beckett : Do it. Now.
Beckett : Or don't you have the balls?
Bracken : And create physical evidence linking me to the crime scene?
Bracken : We both know I'm smarter than that.
UNK: SIGHS
Bracken : Goodbye, Kate.
UNK: The truth is gonna come out!
Bracken : There is no truth.
Bracken : Not anymore.
UNK: DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: No!
UNK: BECKETT STRUGGLES
Thomas : Open her mouth.
Beckett : What was in that pill?
Thomas : Something to relax you.
UNK: Now we're gonna take a little drink.
UNK: CHOKES
Gates : Is there any proof that Bracken did these things?
Esposito : Not anymore. Montgomery had a file, but it's gone now.
UNK: SIGHS
Ryan : Sir, we need to help her.
Gates : No evidence...
Gates : Against one of the most powerful men in the country...
Gates : I don't think we can.
THOMAS : Get the gun. She's wasted.
UNK: COUGHING
UNK: GUN COCKS
UNK: Relax.
Thomas : It's almost over.
Thomas : Let's get your finger in there.
UNK: Good.
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: - GLASS SHATTERS - SCREAMS
UNK: GUN FIRES
UNK: GROANING
UNK: PANTING
UNK: Kate?
