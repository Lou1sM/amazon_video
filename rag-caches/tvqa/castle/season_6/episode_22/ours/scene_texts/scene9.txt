Beckett : in case anyone subpoenaed her notes.
Castle : That's ingenious.
Beckett : Except she was the only one that knew what it meant.
Beckett : I gave it to contacts in the NSA, the FBI, Military Intelligence.
Beckett : No one was able to decipher it.
CASTLE : This is the day she died.
Castle : There's gotta be something in here about that case.
Beckett : We don't have time to figure it out.
Beckett : Come on, Castle, we gotta go.
Castle : Hey, look at this last entry. "D Me with family"?
UNK: "Dinner with family."
Beckett : She was on her way to the restaurant to meet us the night that she was killed.
UNK: But look how close the "D" is to the "M."
UNK: "D.M."?
UNK: "Detective Montgomery."
UNK: "E," "evidence." Detective Montgomery evidence?
Beckett : - Do you think that... - I do.
UNK: "With family."
Castle : She was bringing the tape to you.
Castle : Maybe to give it to your father for safekeeping.
UNK: Which means she would've had it on her when she was killed.
UNK: Bracken would've recovered that.
Castle : Only, we know he didn't,
Castle : otherwise he wouldn't still be looking for it.
Beckett : So what did she do with the tape?
UNK: DOOR BURSTS OPEN
UNK: - OFFICER 1 : Hands! Hands! Hands! - INDISTINCT SHOUTING
UNK: Get down! Head down! Get on the ground!
UNK: ELEVATOR BELL DINGS
UNK: Hey, guys, I'm so sorry.
Esposito : Please. We're the ones who screwed up.
Ryan : We led them right to you.
DONOVAN : Keep them here till I get back.
Donovan : I want to personally escort them to Booking.
Beckett : - Castle... - Shh.
Castle : It's not your fault.
Beckett : I really thought we were going to make it.
Castle : Hey. Whatever happens...
UNK: Castle.
Beckett : The elephants.
Castle : I don't understand.
Beckett : They were my mom's.
UNK: Before they were on my desk, she used to keep them on hers.
Beckett : She used to joke about how they were like a family.
Beckett : Just like us. Me, my mom, my dad.
Beckett : They were a family.
UNK: MAN 1 : Hey, stay right there. MAN 2 : Hey!
Gates : Detective Beckett!
Donovan : Step back, Detective. Do it now.
Donovan : - Show me your hands! - No! Wait!
Donovan : Put it down!
Donovan : Drop it, now!
