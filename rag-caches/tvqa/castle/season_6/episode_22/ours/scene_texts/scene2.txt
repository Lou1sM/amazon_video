Beckett : then we'll find the forensic evidence in it.
Beckett : He'll have no choice but to cut a deal and give up Bracken.
Beckett : It's just that we're so close, Castle. I can feel it.
Beckett : But we need to find that car.
Castle : Ryan and Esposito are all over this. You know that, right?
UNK: CELLPHONE RINGS
Beckett : It's the precinct.
Beckett : Hey. How'd it go?
Ryan : We had to cut Vulcan loose.
UNK: What?
UNK: Richard Castle : What happened?
Ryan : His lawyers are claiming that it's not him in that photo.
Ryan : And since Vulcan doesn't have any vehicles registered to his name,
Ryan : we can't prove that it is.
Beckett : Ryan, listen to me. You have to seize that town car
Beckett : before he gets rid of all of the evidence of the murder.
Ryan : Well, we would if we could, but the man has no paper trail.
Ryan : We can't even figure out where he lives, let alone where he keeps that car.
