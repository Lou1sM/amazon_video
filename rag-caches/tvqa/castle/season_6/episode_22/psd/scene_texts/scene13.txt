GATES : Gentlemen,
Gates : is there something going on here that I should know about?
Beckett : What do you mean?
Gates : Beckett's not a killer. I know that.
Gates : But she's going to go down for this.
UNK: It's open and shut. Unless I can protect her.
Gates : And I can't do that if I'm left in the dark.
Gates : So if she's being set up, I need to know why.
