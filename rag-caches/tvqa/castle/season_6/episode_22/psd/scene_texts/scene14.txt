Ryan : Sir, how much do you know about Beckett's mother's murder?
UNK: It was a random stabbing. Never solved.
Esposito : There's a lot more to it than that.
Gates : Tell me everything.
Castle : The fugitive suite. Best room that cash and no ID can buy.
UNK: SIGHS
UNK: We've got to take the fight to Bracken.
Castle : By looking for a mythical tape that no one can find?
Castle : No, Smith was right. Once we change your look, we get out of town.
Beckett : You know, Castle, my mom had a saying.
Beckett : Vincit omnia veritas.
UNK: "Truth conquers all."
Beckett : We'll never find the truth if we run away.
UNK: Kate, we're never gonna find the truth if we're dead.
Castle : We're not running away. We are surviving, okay?
Castle : We're living to fight another day. We will take down Bracken.
UNK: First, we're gonna find a safe place and come up with a plan.
Castle : I've got a friend. He will give us a car, no questions asked.
Beckett : Okay, go.
Castle : I'll be back.
Castle : We'll be back.
