Beckett : And that's Montgomery.
UNK: You took us for a lot of money, Bracken.
UNK: We want assurances.
UNK: SENATOR BRACKEN : Hey, be happy I haven't busted
UNK: the three of you for your little mafia extortion ring.
MONTGOMERY : Whoa. Relax!
UNK: SENATOR BRACKEN : No, no. You want assurances? Here you go.
UNK: I assure you that as easily as I pinned Bob Armen's murder on Pulgatti,
UNK: I could just as easily put it on the cops who actually did the deed.
Gates : Bracken just admitted to blackmailing them.
UNK: He sure did.
