UNK: Montgomery voiceover : I knew he was giving me another chance, and I thought,

BECKETT : You're Montgomery. I mean, Captain Montgomery.
UNK: Do I know you, Officer Beckett?
Beckett : No, sir, I just...
Beckett : I've always wanted to do what you do. I wanted to be in Homicide.
Montgomery : Is that right? And what are you doing now?
UNK: Patrol.
Montgomery : I can see that, but what are you doing in the archives?
UNK: I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to be here.
Beckett : I know I shouldn't be,
UNK: but I was looking into a case. My mom's homicide.
MONTGOMERY : Johanna Beckett.
Beckett : Did you know her?
Montgomery : I know her case is unsolved.
Montgomery : And you're reviewing the files
UNK: to see if they might've missed something.
Beckett : Yes, sir.
Montgomery : If the case is unsolved,
UNK: chances are the answers you're looking for probably aren't in that file.
UNK: What did your mother do, Officer Beckett?
Beckett : She was a lawyer.

UNK: But did you look through her personal belongings?

Montgomery : Stuff like that?
Beckett : Yes, sir. Tons of times. But I haven't found anything that seems relevant.
Montgomery : Well, keep looking. You never know when something might turn up.
Montgomery : Nice meeting you, Officer Beckett.
