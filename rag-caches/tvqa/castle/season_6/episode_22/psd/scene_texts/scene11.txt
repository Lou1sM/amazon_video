Castle : Let's go.
CASTLE : He's late.
Beckett : Maybe he changed his mind, got spooked.
Castle : This guy doesn't spook.
Beckett : SIGHS Do you really think he can help us?
Castle : He has before.
Smith : That's close enough.
UNK: I've gone to great lengths to keep alive. I'd like to stay that way.
BECKETT : And yet you came back.
UNK: Well, I can survive in the shadows. I just don't want to live there forever.
Castle : You need to take Bracken down. Same as we do.
Beckett : There has to be a way.
Smith : Yes, and I thought I'd found it.
