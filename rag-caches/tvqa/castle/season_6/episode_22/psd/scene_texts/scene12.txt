Smith : I got to one of Bracken's men.
UNK: He told me there was something that the Senator was afraid of.
Smith : A recording made by a former associate to protect himself.
Smith : A recording in which Bracken admits to murder.
Beckett : Do you know where it is?
Smith : No, and neither does Bracken.
UNK: Though he spent considerable resources trying to recover it,
Smith : as did I,
Smith : for over a year, with no luck.
Smith : Hell, it may not even exist.
Smith : But in my search, I did make a contact.
UNK: A consultant at Bracken's organization.
Smith : And he promised
Smith : that he could expose Bracken's campaign finances as corrupt.
Smith : But it got him killed.
Beckett : - Jason Marks. - SMITH : Yes.
Smith : I was close to bringing him into the fold,
UNK: but they must've found out, which made him a liability.
UNK: There's got to be another way to get to Bracken.
Smith : There isn't. I just have to start again.
Beckett : We've been tracking Vulcan's network. Maybe we can help.
Smith : Detective, you are radioactive.
Smith : You can't even help yourself.
Smith : Don't try to contact me again.
CASTLE : Smith, there must be something we can do.
Smith : Run. Disappear.
Smith : Because if you don't,
Smith : he will kill you.
Ryan : She's all over the news.
Ryan : You heard anything from them? Calls? Texts?
Esposito : - Not since this afternoon. - Hmm.
Esposito : And we can't make a move till we know where they are.
