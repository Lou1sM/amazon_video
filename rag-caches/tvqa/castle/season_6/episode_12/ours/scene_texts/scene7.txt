Cross : You look good.
Martha : Yeah, well, you've looked better.
UNK: Oh!
UNK: Sorry.
Castle : Okay, I boiled everything, just like you said.
Castle : But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery
Castle : involved a board game
Castle : and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.
Cross : You bring the booze?
Castle : Yeah, no, right here. You want something to dull the pain?
Cross : No, I want you to steady your nerves. Take a swig.
Castle : Good idea.
UNK: Okay.
Cross : Okay, now make an incision through the wound, about an inch long.
Castle : Here you go.
Castle : Okay. About an inch.
UNK: INHALES SHARPLY
Beckett : - Okay. - MARTHA : Oh.
UNK: All right, now here comes the fun part.
Cross : Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.
Cross : But do me a favor.
UNK: Try not to make my nose light up, huh?
UNK: CHUCKLES LIGHTLY
UNK: Right. Okay.
UNK: SQUISHING
UNK: GROANS
Castle : I think I have it.
UNK: I got it.
UNK: Oh!
Castle : I don't got it. Sorry.
Martha : Careful, Richard.
Cross : Now that you know how not to do it, why don't you try the other way?
UNK: Yeah. Right.
Martha : Okay. Let me just get you here.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: GROANS
Castle : I think I have it.
UNK: All right. I think I...
Castle : - I have it. - Bravo.
Cross : Real good.
Castle : - Here we go. - Here we go.
Cross : Martha, hand me the needle and thread.
UNK: Uh... Okay, here it is. And here we go.
UNK: All right. You've stitched yourself up before, I take it?
UNK: At least this time I got a needle.
UNK: Ah.
Castle : So, you want to tell us how you got shot?
Cross : Not particularly.
Castle : What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison?
Castle : You want to tell us about that?
Cross : Don't believe everything you read.
Castle : So you didn't kill them?
Cross : I work outside the system. Which means I need an effective cover.
Cross : Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam,
Cross : opens a lot of doors.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
BECKETT : Castle?
UNK: Crap.
Beckett : Hey. So I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers anything more
Beckett : about the man from the sketches.
