Beckett : Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.
Ryan : Why here? What was he up to?
Esposito : Yo! Funnel cake vendor remembered seeing Ted.
Esposito : Said he got his food and walked in this direction.
Beckett : - Was he with anyone? - Not that he saw.
UNK: The killer must've followed him.
Beckett : Or maybe they came here to meet.
UNK: Yeah, but why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?
Esposito : Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan
Esposito : to the victim's own apartment?
Ryan : To throw us off his trail.
Beckett : Or maybe the killer didn't want us to find the crime scene
Beckett : because there's something here that ties him to the murder.
Beckett : Do they have security cameras here?
Esposito : Just that one covering the south entrance.
Beckett : Okay, let's talk to park security,
Beckett : get them to give us the surveillance footage.
