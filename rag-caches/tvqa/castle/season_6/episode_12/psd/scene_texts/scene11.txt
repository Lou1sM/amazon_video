Ryan : So it's totally untraceable.
Esposito : Yeah. Whoever this guy is, he's in a different league.
UNK: And we've crossed paths before.
Castle : What do you mean?
UNK: Check this out. Remember this guy?
UNK: Alexis' kidnapping last year.
RYAN : Damn, that's right!
Ryan : Witnesses kept seeing him pop up at locations associated with her abduction.
UNK: And at each one of those locations there was a dead body.
Beckett : So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine in the AG's office
Beckett : and he got a hit. Now, he couldn't get into details,
Beckett : but he did say that this guy is a former CIA operative.
Castle : Wait a minute. Former?
UNK: Yeah. He was disowned for an unauthorized assassination.
Beckett : He was sentenced to life, broke out, killed three guards in the process.
Beckett : This guy's wanted by our government.
UNK: Now, my friend said that the rumor is he's working as a hit man.
Beckett : And if we get eyes on him,
Beckett : the AG's office wants us to call them so they can send in a strike team.
Ryan : Why would a guy like this want to kill Ted Rollins?
Esposito : More than that, how are we gonna find a former spy?
Esposito : He spent a lifetime covering his tracks.
Beckett : Yeah, but Ted hasn't. And somehow they're connected.
Ryan : So we should see if Hansel left any bread crumbs towards our suspect?
Beckett : We need to retrace every one of Ted's footsteps.
Beckett : Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived.
Beckett : I mean, they had to have had previous contact.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Castle, did you ever see this man in Paris?
Castle : Not that I can remember. Why don't you text me those sketches?
Castle : I'll have Alexis come over and see if she recognizes him.
UNK: Do you want me to come along?
UNK: No, no, no. That's... I'll call you.
Beckett : Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah.
