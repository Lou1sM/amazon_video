UNK: GROANING
UNK: Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh.
Martha : You need to lie down.
Martha : All right. I am calling an ambulance for you.
Beckett : No, no. It's just that my blood sugar's low.
Cross : You got any juice?
UNK: Uh, yes.
UNK: 5 : 04. We blew it.
Beckett : Did we? Or did we just get played?
Beckett : Look, Castle, I know he's your father,
Beckett : but what if there's an ulterior motive to all of this?
UNK: COMPUTER CHIMES
Beckett : Kingfish is online. Go.
UNK: All right. Okay... "T," hashtag, less than, "L."
UNK: - Upper case "L." - Oh, capital "L."
UNK: You've gotta get online before the buyer. Come on.
UNK: I'm in. Downloading the file at the slowest speed possible.
UNK: That gives you less than three minutes.
Beckett : Okay, you stay here. You tell me how much time I have.
Beckett : Can you hear me?
Castle : Yeah. I can hear you.
Beckett : Signal's getting stronger.
Cross : You've got two minutes, 40 seconds left.
Castle : Oh, no.
UNK: You've got under two minutes.
Beckett : Castle, I'm at the stairs
Beckett : and the signal's gotten weak again. Did I pass him?
Beckett : Wait a minute.
UNK: Wait, we are demonstrating two-dimensional thinking here,
UNK: like Khan in Star Trek IL : Wrath of Khan.
Beckett : Khan didn't realize that the Enterprise was below him.
Castle : Right. So if we are the Enterprise, that means Gemini is...
UNK: - Is above us. - Exactly.
UNK: CELL PHONE CHIMING
Castle : Oh, this is so not the time, Mother.
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
CASTLE : A minute fifteen left.
Beckett : Castle, I'm in the book stacks. I'm close.
Castle : All right, less than a minute. Be careful.
UNK: CELL PHONE CHIMES
UNK: WHISPERS LOUDLY Mom! BEEP
Castle : Do you see him? Is he there?
UNK: Beckett?
Castle : Oh, no.
UNK: What?
Beckett : Oh, Castle. He set up some kind of a relay system.
Beckett : - Gemini could be anywhere. - What?
UNK: COMPUTER CHIMES
UNK: Hang on, something is wrong.
UNK: What?
UNK: Well, the download is complete, but this is not a CIA list.
UNK: This is... This is a phone book.
UNK: Tony Blaine : Richard Castle. Wow.
UNK: Castle?
Blaine : I am so sorry to bother you, sir, but I'm, like, your number one fan.
UNK: Could I get an autograph?
UNK: Actually, this is really not a good time.
BECKETT : What are you talking about?
UNK: Castle?
Beckett : Castle, are you there?
Castle : That was you at the park, wasn't it?
Castle : Dressed as a homeless guy?
Castle : You're Gemini.
Blaine : Let's go, nice and quiet.
Blaine : The man who sent you, who is he?
Castle : Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
Blaine : I saw you in the park with him. Is he CIA?
Castle : A phone book.
Castle : You knew not to send the real list
Castle : because you were trying to draw him into the open.
Ryan : That's right.
Blaine : Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable.
