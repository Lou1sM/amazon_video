UNK: What?
Castle : He's your future father-in-law.
Cross : Nice to see you again, Kate.
Martha : SIGHS Katherine, I want to say this isn't what it looks like,
Martha : but it is.
UNK: I was gonna tell you, I swear.
Beckett : When? After you patched him up, sent him on his merry way?
UNK: He's wanted by the government. You are harboring a fugitive!
Castle : That's just his cover.
Beckett : And you know that how? Because he told you?
Castle : Because of Paris and because he's my father.
Beckett : He is not your father. He made that choice a long time ago.
Beckett : This man is my suspect. Now, you know what I have to do, right?
UNK: Well, she is a spitfire, this one.
Cross : I'm glad we're on the same side.
Beckett : Who says we're on the same side?
UNK: I'm sorry, he wouldn't stay put.
UNK: - Richard, I need your laptop. Now. - Right.
Beckett : No. The only thing that you are getting is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.
Cross : You're not going to arrest me.
Beckett : - Really? Why? - Because you want answers.
Cross : And if you take me in, you're not gonna get any.
Cross : The Feds will swoop in.
Cross : You won't have anything and I'll have lost valuable time.
Cross : You want Ted's killer? So do I.
Cross : But there's a hell of a lot more at stake here than murder.
UNK: Then you're gonna have to tell me what it is.
UNK: Well, there was a massive breach at the CIA.
Cross : Someone hacked the files
Cross : containing the identities of our deep-cover operatives.
