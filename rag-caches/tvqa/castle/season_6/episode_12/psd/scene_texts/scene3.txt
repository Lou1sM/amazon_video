UNK: And here's why.
UNK: Yesterday, at 7 : 19 p.m., Ted connected to a dedicated server
UNK: of a private computer network. I traced the network.
UNK: It belongs to Universal Banking Solutions.
UNK: They're based in Chicago, but have satellite offices all over the world,
UNK: including Manhattan, which is where Ted connected.
Castle : Now, according to the website, Universal Banking Solutions handles
Castle : strategic and tactical procurements for international clients.
Beckett : And what does that mean?
Beckett : I don't know. I'm just reading the screen there.
Beckett : Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?
Tori : It's impossible to tell. He could have sent an e-mail or accessed the website.
Beckett : Or he hacked it.
TORY : That, too. Whatever he did,
UNK: it was the last time this laptop was used before he died.
Beckett : Okay, so who runs the Manhattan office?
UNK: "Anderson Cross."
Beckett : All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.
BECKETT : I don't know, Castle, maybe your mom's right.
UNK: I think elopement's a great idea.
