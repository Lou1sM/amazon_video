Blaine : All right, mystery writer, tell me a story.
Blaine : Who's your handler? What's his name? Where is he?
Castle : Why should I tell you? You're just gonna kill me anyway.
Blaine : Yeah, but I can kill you slow or I can kill you fast. It's up to you.
UNK: CLATTER
UNK: GROANING Aah!
UNK: Aah! Uhh!
UNK: Aah.
UNK: GROANS
UNK: Are you all right?
UNK: Me? You're the one who was shot!
Cross : Wasn't the first time.
Castle : - I'll go call an ambulance. - Don't bother.
UNK: No! No, no, wait.
Castle : Why would you do that?
Cross : That was the mission. That's what I do.
Castle : How did you even find me?
Cross : Your left coat pocket.
Castle : What is this? Some kind of GPS locator?
Castle : How did you...
Castle : The hug. You slipped this on me.
Cross : I needed to keep tabs on you.
Castle : Yeah, to use me as bait.
Cross : Well, after the shootout at the apartment, I knew I was blown.
Cross : But I still had to recover this list.
Castle : So to keep the upper hand, you let Beckett and me walk into a trap.
UNK: We could've been killed.
Cross : I would never let anything happen to you two.
