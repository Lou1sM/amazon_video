Esposito : Either one of you know what it was doing there?
Beckett : What is it?
UNK: Ted was a computer whiz.
Grant : More like a genius.
UNK: MR. ROLLINS : But it got him into trouble.
UNK: When Ted was in high school, he got into identity thefts.
UNK: Hijacking, credit cards, bank accounts. Stuff like that.
UNK: And he'd call it "pulling a Robin Hood."
Grant : Because he would steal from the rich and give to the poor.
Esposito : The poor being Ted?
UNK: He was just a kid.
Esposito : So, how much did he end up stealing?
UNK: - $1.4 million. - Whoa.
UNK: MR. ROLLINS : But the judge made him give it back.
UNK: Part of Ted's plea deal was that he was barred from using
UNK: any devices connecting him to the Internet.
UNK: So he shouldn't have had that laptop.
Beckett : Is there anything to indicate that he went back to committing identity theft?
UNK: I was laid off and Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.
UNK: I knew he was up to something.
UNK: I just didn't want to believe he was hacking again.
Esposito : Okay, so, let's just say he went back to stealing identities.
Esposito : Does that explain why he was killed?
Esposito : Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen,
Esposito : but normally they report it to the police.
Beckett : Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people that don't report to the police.
Beckett : Hey! Look who's back from paternity leave.
Beckett : So, how's Sarah Grace?
UNK: Oh, man, I tell ya, she is just my perfect little angel.
Beckett : - Oh, she's so cute. Wow. - Yeah.
UNK: Is it me or, or does she look a lot like Esposito?
Esposito : - Yeah, she does. - Wow.
Ryan : Really, Beckett? I expected that from jackass, but not from you.
UNK: Anyway, so I got that CSU report back.
UNK: Looks like Ted might've been killed in an auto body shop.
Esposito : Did he even own a car?
Ryan : No, but they identified that sludge on Ted's clothes.
UNK: It's hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks.
