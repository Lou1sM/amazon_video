Cross : There are reasons I have to do what I do, Richard.
Cross : One day you'll understand.
UNK: Hmm?
Cross : Now get Beckett. Let her know we have her killer.
UNK: GRUNTS
Beckett : Castle, what happened?
Castle : Come on. Gemini's down here.

Castle : Of course he took the body.
BECKETT : Yeah.
Beckett : But left Gemini's weapon.
