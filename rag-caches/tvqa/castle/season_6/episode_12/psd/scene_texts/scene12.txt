Esposito : So I'm coming up with a whole bunch of nothing. You?
Beckett : Check it out. It's a printout of Ted's MetroCard.
UNK: Look how he got to Coney Island yesterday.
Esposito : He swiped his card at the 33rd and Park Avenue South station.
UNK: Probably took the Six to the N train. So?
Ryan : So, look at his swipes for the past two weeks.
Esposito : He kept going back and forth to that subway stop at 33rd and Park.
Ryan : Exactly. And he didn't work, live or know anyone in that area.
Esposito : All right, let's get up there and see what he was doing.
Martha : All right.
UNK: - WHIRRING - MARTHA HUMMING
UNK: WHIRRING STOPS
UNK: Oh, Richard, you're home early! Care for a glass of liquefied heaven?
Martha : Good for your hair, good for your teeth.
Martha : Richard, what is it?
UNK: And of course I believed him, because he's my father.
UNK: Well, especially after Paris, I mean, why wouldn't you?
Castle : But he used me to stay ahead of the investigation,
Castle : to know when to make a run for it.
Castle : If he's innocent, why didn't he show up at the park?
Martha : Richard, look,
Martha : the only thing we really know about him is that we don't know him.
Martha : Me? I had one night with him. You? A day in Paris.
Martha : Lean on the people you trust. Call Katherine.
Martha : Tell her what's going on.
UNK: KNOCK ON DOOR
Martha : I'll get that.
Castle : And what if he's telling the truth?
Martha : What if he isn't?
UNK: GASPS
Cross : Hello, Martha.
UNK: Been a while, huh?
Martha : What the hell are you doing here?
Cross : Sorry to miss our meeting, but I was a little busy getting shot.
UNK: Oh, my God! Come in.
Cross : You look good.
Martha : Yeah, well, you've looked better.
UNK: Oh!
UNK: Sorry.
Castle : Okay, I boiled everything, just like you said.
Castle : But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery
Castle : involved a board game
Castle : and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.
Cross : You bring the booze?
Castle : Yeah, no, right here. You want something to dull the pain?
Cross : No, I want you to steady your nerves. Take a swig.
Castle : Good idea.
UNK: Okay.
Cross : Okay, now make an incision through the wound, about an inch long.
Castle : Here you go.
Castle : Okay. About an inch.
UNK: INHALES SHARPLY
Beckett : - Okay. - MARTHA : Oh.
UNK: All right, now here comes the fun part.
Cross : Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.
Cross : But do me a favor.
UNK: Try not to make my nose light up, huh?
UNK: CHUCKLES LIGHTLY
UNK: Right. Okay.
UNK: SQUISHING
UNK: GROANS
Castle : I think I have it.
UNK: I got it.
UNK: Oh!
Castle : I don't got it. Sorry.
Martha : Careful, Richard.
Cross : Now that you know how not to do it, why don't you try the other way?
UNK: Yeah. Right.
Martha : Okay. Let me just get you here.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: GROANS
Castle : I think I have it.
UNK: All right. I think I...
Castle : - I have it. - Bravo.
Cross : Real good.
Castle : - Here we go. - Here we go.
Cross : Martha, hand me the needle and thread.
UNK: Uh... Okay, here it is. And here we go.
UNK: All right. You've stitched yourself up before, I take it?
UNK: At least this time I got a needle.
UNK: Ah.
Castle : So, you want to tell us how you got shot?
Cross : Not particularly.
Castle : What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison?
Castle : You want to tell us about that?
Cross : Don't believe everything you read.
Castle : So you didn't kill them?
Cross : I work outside the system. Which means I need an effective cover.
Cross : Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam,
Cross : opens a lot of doors.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
BECKETT : Castle?
UNK: Crap.
Beckett : Hey. So I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers anything more
Beckett : about the man from the sketches.
Castle : Yeah, about the man in the sketches...
Beckett : There's something you should know about him.
