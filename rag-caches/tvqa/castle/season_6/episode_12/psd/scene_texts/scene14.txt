Cross : Do you know who?
Cross : No. But it was an inside job at the highest level.
Cross : That's why they called me. Because I'm outside.
Cross : My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.
Beckett : What does any of this have to do with Ted?
Cross : Ted was one of my best guys. I recruited him to help me find Gemini.
UNK: Gemini?
Cross : Code name for the mole.
Cross : He was planning on selling the DCO list.
Cross : But we couldn't find him.
Cross : If these files get out, the consequences will be very real.
Cross : Then yesterday we had a breakthrough. Ted identified the buyer,
Cross : and he signaled me to meet so he could tell me who it was, but...
Castle : But Gemini got there first. He killed Ted.
Cross : Leaving me SOL. Until you told me about the Iranian rial.
