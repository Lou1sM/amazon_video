Spencer : She agreed, and we both called Alice.
Spencer : Alice understood our need for privacy, so she offered to turn it over
Spencer : in exchange for a favor.
Esposito : Yeah? What kind of favor?
UNK: It's actually strange.
Spencer : She said she needed a room in one of my hotels for a couple days.
UNK: And I had to promise that there'd be no record that she was ever there.
UNK: Alice dropped 50 grand to charter a plane,
UNK: yet she needed Spenser to comp a hotel room for her?
Beckett : That's because it wasn't about the money. It was about the anonymity.
Beckett : She even told the front desk that
Beckett : she didn't want housekeeping in her room.
Beckett : And she didn't tell her boyfriend where she was.
Castle : Not that she would need housekeeping.
Castle : There's no luggage here. Nothing in the bathroom.
Castle : It's like she was never even here.
Beckett : Yeah, but she checked in yesterday morning.
