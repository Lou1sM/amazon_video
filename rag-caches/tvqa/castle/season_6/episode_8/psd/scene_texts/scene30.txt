UNK: And a few years ago, Janet and I hit a rough patch,
Steve : and I wanted to give her something meaningful.
Steve : It was too easy just to buy her a diamond.
Beckett : So you decided to make one of your own.
Steve : I broke out my equipment so I could make her a small diamond.
Steve : But in the process, I had a game-changing breakthrough.
Steve : My little romantic gesture became one of the biggest diamonds in history.
Steve : Suddenly, I could make flawless stones.
Steve : As many as I wanted.
Castle : With technology that now belonged to VonRoenn.
UNK: But when the downturn hit and you needed cash...
Beckett : You realized you had the means, as long as no one knew.
Steve : It violated our agreement. If VonRoenn found out, they'd ruin me.
Beckett : Which is why you hired a strike team to recover that stone from our custody.
Steve : What? I don't know what you're talking about.
Beckett : Mr. Warner, we found the SUV they used.
UNK: It had been torched, but CSU still was able to pull the VIN number.
Castle : Turns out it was stolen from a garage in Queens.
UNK: And the garage owner, Joseph Bianchi?
Castle : He's the brother-in-law of your head of security.
Castle : We also pulled phone records,
Castle : and found that you and he
Castle : had exchanged at least half a dozen phone calls
Castle : in the hours before the attack.
UNK: What?
Beckett : You ordered that strike.
Steve : I didn't make these calls. I wasn't even home. It's...
UNK: No...
Steve : Janet, what did you do?
Janet : What did I do? I treated her like family.
Janet : I trusted her.
Janet : When Hawke found out it was Alice, I went to her,
Janet : begging for her to give the stone back.
Janet : I only meant to scare her. But she grabbed for the gun, and...
UNK: She would've exposed us, Steve. We were going to lose everything.
Janet : I had to stop her. I had to get it back.
Janet : For us. For you.
UNK: SOBBING
