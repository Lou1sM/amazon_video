Esposito : Did anyone else know you'd taken the diamond?
Leo : The only people that knew that diamond was gone
Leo : were me, Alice, and the Warners.
Steve : We told you, we're not answering questions about that diamond.
UNK: Yeah, that's okay. There's nothing that you can say that we don't already know.
Beckett : For instance, we know it's man-made.
Castle : And we know you are the man who made it.
Beckett : We also know that you made a lot of cash
Beckett : secretly selling those man-made diamonds on foreign markets.
Steve : That's ridiculous. Do you know what I'm worth? Why would I do that?
Beckett : You took a huge hit during the economic downturn.
Beckett : You were leveraged to the hilt.
Beckett : You needed that cash.
Steve : Even if what you're saying is true, that doesn't mean I murdered Alice!
Beckett : You did hire Hawke to get that diamond back.
UNK: EXHALES SHARPLY
Steve : I had to. I was afraid VonRoenn would find out.
UNK: VonRoenn the diamond cartel? What do they have to do with this?
