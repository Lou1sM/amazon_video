Hawke : Do you have a single piece of evidence that I was in her office?
Hawke : Or that I was involved in her death?
Hawke : Prints? DNA?
UNK: Anything?
Hawke : That's what I thought.
Castle : Just like she said. Teflon.
Gates : The only way to nail this man is to figure out who hired him.
Gates : And for that, we need to know what Barrett Hawke was sent to find.
KYLE : I've been through just about everything.
Kyle : Her research notes, her book files, everything's intact.
Kyle : I've rechecked it a couple of times against our index files,
Kyle : and there's only one thing missing.
Esposito : What's that?
Kyle : A client file.
Ryan : Which client?
UNK: Andrew and Monica Spenser.
UNK: Andrew Spenser? The hotel and real estate tycoon?
Esposito : Who would want his file?
Kyle : Actually, I think Andrew Spenser wanted it.
Esposito : Why would he want his own file?
UNK: Because it's not public knowledge yet, but the Spensers are getting a divorce.
