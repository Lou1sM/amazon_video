Ryan : Whatever the reason, Leo wanted that diamond.
UNK: And he was using Alice to get it.
Esposito : Maybe he leveraged her into helping him.
Esposito : Forced her to pull the money out and order up the plane.
UNK: Then he killed her, made this whole thing look like it was her idea.
Ryan : Sir, considering that this guy tried to kill me and Espo for that diamond,
Ryan : mind if we go in there and get some answers?
UNK: Leo Wyngaard : Wait. You think I'm working for the cartels?
UNK: Leo Wyngaard : That I was using Alice?
UNK: Leo Wyngaard : I loved Alice.
Ryan : You always use fake names with women that you love?
Leo : She knew who I really was. We were in this together.
Esposito : Yeah, sure you were. Why did you steal that diamond?
UNK: Alice and I met in Rwanda when I was doing aid work.
Leo : We were young and in love.
Leo : Then one day, soldiers came to the village,
Leo : financed by the diamond cartel.
