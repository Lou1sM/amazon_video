UNK: Richard Castle : You okay?
UNK: Kate Beckett : Yeah. Yeah, I'm just...
UNK: What?
UNK: It's like he's glaring at me.
Castle : - What? What do you mean? Linus? - Mmm-hmm.
Beckett : Whenever I come over here, it feels like he's watching me.
UNK: Do you ever notice how his eyes follow you when you move?
Castle : Yeah, I love that. It keeps you on alert.
Beckett : Yeah, well, Castle, I'm a cop. I'm always on alert.
UNK: When I come home, I just wanna relax.
Beckett : Not fall asleep staring into the eyes of a hungry lion about to pounce.
