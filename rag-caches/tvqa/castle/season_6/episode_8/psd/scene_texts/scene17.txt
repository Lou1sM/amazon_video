Beckett : Just curious. When the two of you would meet with Alice,
UNK: would you go to her office, or would she come to your home?
Janet : Both. Why?
Castle : Did she ever have access to your place?
Castle : Did you ever give her keys or security codes?
Steve : No, why would we? What's this all about?
Beckett : We believe her murder is connected to a theft.
Beckett : A theft?
Beckett : Yeah, a rather significant one.
Castle : Either of you notice anything missing?
Steve : Like what?
Steve : I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Beckett : Mr. Warner, that is your diamond. All 100 carats of it.
Beckett : It was found in Alice's possession. Any idea how she got it?
Steve : I think there's been a mistake. This isn't ours.
Kyle : It's not?
Janet : I've never seen that stone before in my life.
Beckett : Really? Well, you were wearing it the other night.
JANET : Oh, I see the confusion.
Janet : The stone in my necklace, that's not a diamond.
Janet : It's a costume piece. It's just crystal.
