Matt : Though at lunch the other day, she seemed a little rattled.
UNK: She said she'd received a call from a pissed-off client.
UNK: Do you know who?
UNK: Like I said, she was discreet.
Beckett : Okay, thanks.
Castle : Hey, listen to this.
UNK: "Males of both species define their territory,
UNK: "then honor the female by inviting them in."
UNK: See, I'm honoring you by inviting you into my territory.
Castle : And Linus is part of that territory.
UNK: And if you wanna be invited into my territory again,
Beckett : you should probably rethink that.
Beckett : So CSU just finished with the car and the office,
Beckett : and they found no prints and almost no trace evidence.
Beckett : It's like both locations had been cleaned.
Castle : That, and the cameras? This guy's a pro.
UNK: Okay, so then why would a professional assassin murder a therapist?
Castle : Because, as a therapist, she'd be privy to her clients' deepest, darkest secrets.
UNK: Secrets so explosive that simply hearing them ensured her demise.
Beckett : All right, what kind of secrets?
UNK: Well, nuclear launch codes. That the moonwalk was a fake.
Castle : That Roswell wasn't.
Castle : Secret location of the cryogenically-frozen body of Walt...
UNK: Well, boyfriend checks out. Called his office.
Ryan : They verified that he was working all last night.
Ryan : But Alice definitely tumbled down the rabbit hole to Shadyland.
Ryan : That alert on her phone, N-F-1-9-4-5?
Ryan : It's the tail number of a private jet that she chartered.
Beckett : She chartered a private jet? To where?
Ryan : I contacted the pilot out of Teterboro.
UNK: He said Alice paid him 50 grand in cash to be on standby with a full tank of gas.
