Ryan : You think it's the diamond industry who sent in the clowns?
Castle : With the future of their industry at stake,
Castle : who knows how far they'd go?
UNK: Hey, guys. Tory got a hit.
Beckett : So CSU was able to pull a usable print?
UNK: Yeah. Lucky for us, the lady wasn't big into washing her car.
UNK: When we ran the print, nothing popped in the federal database.
Esposito : But given the international nature of the diamond industry,
UNK: I asked Tory to cast a wider net. We contacted Interpol.
Ryan : Our mugger's a foreign national?
Tori : South African, to be exact. His name is Leo Wyngaard.
Tori : In and out of half a dozen African prisons.
Esposito : Not to mention he's on the Terror Watch List.
Castle : Just the kind of guy a diamond cartel would hire for their dirty work.
UNK: Mmm-hmm. Now show 'em the picture.
Esposito : Look familiar?
Beckett : That's Matt Lanchet.
Castle : Alice's boyfriend.
RYAN : They almost missed him at JFK.
Ryan : He was boarding a flight to Johannesburg.
UNK: He must've cut his losses once he knew we had secured the diamond.
Esposito : I still don't get why the Warners had a man-made stone in the first place.
