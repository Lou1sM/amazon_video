Castle : If we can figure out what that story is, it might just give us a path to our killer.
Beckett : Yeah, Castle's right. This city is the hub of the nation's diamond trade.
Beckett : There has to be an expert out there that can tell us where it came from.
UNK: Such beauty. It's absolutely stunning.
Esposito : Can you tell where it came from?
Peters : Diamonds are not people, Detective.
UNK: A diamond mined in Asia looks the same as a diamond mined in Africa.
UNK: However, there are no mines in America, so it is not from here.
Ryan : What my partner means is have you come across this stone before?
UNK: Never.
Peters : And as head of the American Gemological Foundation,

Esposito : So you don't know who owns it?
Peters : No, and I should.
Peters : I mean, the discovery of an incredible gem like this is headline-making.
UNK: They'd become famous.
