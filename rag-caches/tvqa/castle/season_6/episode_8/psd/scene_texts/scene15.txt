Ryan : or something else is going on here.
UNK: He's right. This is starting to sound like
Castle : it's about a whole lot more than just a diamond.
GATES : Okay, get cleaned up.
Gates : I need you two to go hunting for that SUV.
Gates : Whatever's going on, Alice was in it up to her eyeballs.
Gates : If any of her clients have even the remotest connection
Gates : to a country that produces diamonds, I wanna know about it.
Beckett : - Yes, sir. - All right.
Castle : So I was thinking...
Castle : When we work a case together,
Castle : this desk of yours is sort of, kind of our space.
UNK: And these elephants-on-parade have creeped me out since day one,
Castle : so what do you say we just get rid of these?
UNK: Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a problem with that,
Castle : if I try to get rid of something that obviously has deep meaning to you?
Beckett : If you don't like the elephants, I don't like the elephants.
UNK: Fine.
Castle : I actually like those elephants.
Castle : They obviously have family values, and this one's good with money.
UNK: Anyway, any luck on Alice's clients?
Beckett : Yeah. A couple of possibilities.
Beckett : A hedge fund manager with investments in South Africa.
Beckett : A UN diplomat with ties to Russia.
Beckett : And a CEO with a manufacturing plant 80 miles from a Chinese mine.
UNK: What if we're looking at this wrong?
Castle : What if it's not about Alice's clients but it's actually about Alice?
Castle : What do you mean?
Castle : When she was living with the gorillas in Africa, that was in Rwanda,
Castle : right along the border of the Congo. A region known for conflict diamonds.
