Hawke : But Alice was already dead when I got there.
Hawke : I do things, Detective. Questionable things. But I don't kill.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : So then who attacked my colleagues?
UNK: It wasn't me. It wasn't the Warners.
Hawke : Maybe somebody else was looking for the diamond.
Beckett : And how did you know Alice stole it?
Hawke : Because when the Warners described the mugging,
Hawke : I could tell it was an inside job.
Beckett : The Warners were mugged?
Hawke : Two nights ago. And it wasn't random.
Hawke : The mugger knew exactly when and where they were going to be.
Hawke : So did Alice.
Hawke : Not only that, but Janet told Alice about the diamond
Hawke : in one of their sessions.
Hawke : Apparently, hardly anyone else knew the diamond was real.
Hawke : I figured Alice had to be involved.
Beckett : Okay, so if the Warners were mugged, why wouldn't they just go to the police?
UNK: They wanted to keep things quiet.
