UNK: Keep 'em closed.
Beckett : Castle, I swear, if you're bringing me face-to-face with Linus,
UNK: I'm gonna pull my gun out and shoot him.
Castle : - That will not be necessary. - Okay.
UNK: Okay, open 'em.
BECKETT : Sea shells?
UNK: Not just sea shells, those are our sea shells. We collected those...
Beckett : On our first walk in the Hamptons.
Beckett : Castle, you kept these?
Castle : Now, I know it doesn't really go with the space,
Castle : but at least it won't be hungrily staring at you in the morning.
Beckett : You didn't have to do this.
Castle : No, I did. I did. I finished reading Alice's book.
Castle : And there's a chapter in there that speaks to couples like us.
Castle : See, we're both alphas.
Castle : And it says that we need to define our shared territory together.
UNK: These art pieces all over? These are all my stories.
Castle : But the shells? That's ours.
Beckett : - I like our story. - Yeah. Me, too.
