Leo : And then Alice called me out of the blue.
Leo : Said one of her clients, Steve Warner, had a secret.
UNK: Wait. Are you telling me that Steve Warner can make diamonds?
UNK: Yes.
Leo : Man-made diamonds are nothing new,
Leo : but no one had ever produced this quality of gem before.
Leo : Big and flawless.
Leo : Soon, diamond mines would be a relic of the past.
Leo : Steve Warner's technology could change everything.
Leo : So I approached Warner. I begged him to make his technology available.
Leo : But he denied he even had it.
Leo : He was just using it to line his own pockets.
Leo : The world needed to know, and we needed proof.
Tori : The necklace.
Leo : We knew that if we could just examine that stone
Leo : that we could tie it back to the others.
UNK: Then we could show everyone what he was doing,
Leo : and they could all see that it was possible.
UNK: Then everyone would eventually unlock the code.
Esposito : Then all of a sudden, flawless, man-made diamonds
Esposito : would flood the market.
Leo : No more cartels. No more sponsored bloodshed.
Leo : We were going to change the world.
Leo : That night, Alice had a plane standing by to take us to a private lab.
Leo : But she never showed.
