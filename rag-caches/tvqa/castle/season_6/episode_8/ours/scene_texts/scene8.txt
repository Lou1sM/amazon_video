UNK: Conservatively.
Esposito : Yeah, I ain't that tall.
UNK: 6-0? Like, with another six zeros after that?
UNK: That would be 60 million, yes.
Beckett : Is it possible it's an heirloom passed down through generations
Beckett : and that's why there's no record of it?
UNK: Nah, Peters said that old-school cutters
Esposito : fashioned diamonds with sharp edges.
Esposito : This one has smooth edges,
UNK: which means it had to be cut within the last few decades.
Ryan : And no Customs declaration means it was smuggled in,
Ryan : probably from the country where it was mined.
Gates : Were we able to connect any of Alice's clients to the diamond?
Beckett : We're still going through them, but no, not yet.
UNK: Peters said he also found some glue residue on the stone,
Ryan : which suggests that it was set in a piece of jewelry.
Castle : For engaged men everywhere, I can only hope it wasn't a ring.
Gates : Get that rock back to the precinct.
UNK: I want it under lock, key, and armed guard.
Esposito : We're on our way.
UNK: So, we thinking the same thing?
Ryan : That it's a bummer we can't stop for lunch,
UNK: because there's a $60 million diamond sitting between us?
Esposito : No. That because of the $60 million diamond sitting between us
Esposito : that we are not-really-but-kinda-sorta
Esposito : thinking about making a run for the border.
Ryan : Hadn't even crossed my mind.
Esposito : Of course it didn't.
Esposito : Nope, you wouldn't have the stones.
Esposito : All I'm saying.
Esposito : - You breathing? - Yeah. For now.
Esposito : Gun! Get down!
UNK: There's three of them! The diamond!
UNK: Subway entrance, seven o'clock. I'll cover. Go!
UNK: Go!
Ryan : - You all right? - Yeah.
