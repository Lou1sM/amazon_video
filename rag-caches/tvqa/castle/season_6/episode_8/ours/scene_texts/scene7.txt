UNK: Such beauty. It's absolutely stunning.
Esposito : Can you tell where it came from?
Peters : Diamonds are not people, Detective.
UNK: A diamond mined in Asia looks the same as a diamond mined in Africa.
UNK: However, there are no mines in America, so it is not from here.
Ryan : What my partner means is have you come across this stone before?
UNK: Never.
Peters : And as head of the American Gemological Foundation,
Peters : I know every extraordinary stone on the planet.
Esposito : So you don't know who owns it?
Peters : No, and I should.
Peters : I mean, the discovery of an incredible gem like this is headline-making.
UNK: They'd become famous.
Ryan : Could it be a recent import?
UNK: No. I am copied on gem reports that pass through Customs,
Peters : and nothing remotely this size has come through
Peters : in my entire tenure at the AGF.
Peters : No. The origins of this stone are a complete mystery.
UNK: Can you tell me how you came to possess it?
Esposito : It's evidence in an ongoing investigation, so...
Ryan : What can you tell us about this diamond?
Peters : I should like to run additional spectrometer and imaging tests on it,
Peters : but, for the meantime, let me start with the four C's.
Ryan : Color, cut, clarity, carat.
Ryan : You'd know this if you ever bought an engagement ring.
Peters : The diamond is colorless.
UNK: No blemishes, so a pristine cut.
Peters : No internal clouding
UNK: and nearly 100 carats.
UNK: Whew!
Esposito : Man! Hey, how deep would my pockets have to be to afford a rock like that?
Peters : Detective, you are not tall enough to have pockets deep enough.
UNK: But I would say it's worth $60 million.
