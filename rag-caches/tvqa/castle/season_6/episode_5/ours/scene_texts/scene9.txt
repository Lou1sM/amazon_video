Ryan : He's on leave this semester. The university has no idea where he is.
Ryan : Still trying to look for his parents...
Doyle : Detective, it's him! Deschile!
Beckett : You know him?
Doyle : Of course I know him. Everyone knows him.
Doyle : Oh, man, if he's killed...
UNK: Yeah, okay. I'll call you back. Doyle, sit down!
Doyle : No wonder billions of people die!
Castle : Okay, who the hell is Paul Deschile?
Doyle : The energy wars, all right? I told you about the other side.
Doyle : A group of fascists, they were worse than the Nazis.
Doyle : They were slaughtering people by the tens of thousands, okay?
Doyle : They were winning, until Deschile.
Doyle : He and his team, they created an energy shield, okay?
Doyle : It was able to stop their weapons. It completely turned the tide.
Doyle : Detective, listen to me. Ward is still obviously fighting for the fascists!
UNK: They're trying to win the war by re-writing history.
Doyle : And if he kills Deschile, there will be no energy shield!
Doyle : And without that energy shield, we lose that war!
