UNK: Ward's gonna kill Deschile and that is why billions of people die!
Beckett : Okay, you know what? We don't have time for this.
Beckett : Take him to holding, please.
Doyle : Fine, we don't have time. You're correct, okay?
Doyle : Forget everything I said.
Doyle : Forget about time travel, forget about wars, none of that matters!
Doyle : All that matters is Deschile! You understand me?
Doyle : You keep him alive! He cannot die!
UNK: No, Deschile. Yeah, Paul Deschile.
UNK: No, wait. Please, don't put me on hold.
UNK: Anything?
UNK: Esposito got a hold of his parents in Oregon.
Beckett : They think he's staying with a friend in the city,
Beckett : which is who I'm holding for now.
Castle : You don't think any of this could possibly be real, do you?
Beckett : I don't know, Castle.
Beckett : But I have no intention of letting this kid die.
Beckett : Yes, hi, this is Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.
UNK: I'm trying to get a hold of a Paul Deschile.
UNK: Where?
Beckett : He's at the planetarium.
Beckett : Wait, just like you told what other guy? Who else did you tell?
Beckett : Ward knows.
UNK: Planetarium's all the way uptown. We'll never get there in time.
UNK: MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER : The cosmos is vast and glorious.
UNK: Planetarium Narrator : More wondrous than we can fathom.
UNK: Planetarium Narrator : It takes our breath away, and ignites our imagination.
UNK: Planetarium Narrator : It is the essence of time itself,
UNK: Planetarium Narrator : the past, the present, and the future.
UNK: Planetarium Narrator : It's an enigma seemingly impossible to grasp,
UNK: and yet we pursue its mysteries.
UNK: Planetarium Narrator : We dare to reach out to understand the swirling galaxies,
UNK: explore new stars...
UNK: Time ceases to exist.
UNK: MAN CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY
UNK: GUN COCKS
ESPOSITO : Freeze!
UNK: AUDIENCE GASPING AND MURMURING
Esposito : Don't even think about it.
Ryan : NYPD! Let me see your hands right now!
UNK: AUDIENCE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY
UNK: Knife!
UNK: AUDIENCE SCREAMING
Ryan : You okay, kid?
UNK: - EXHALES - HANDCUFFS CLINKING
BECKETT : Why Wickfield?
Beckett : Why Deschile?
Beckett : What were you hoping to accomplish?
Beckett : Who is that man?
Beckett : You ran from him at the power plant. Why?
Beckett : Mr. Ward, there is no record of you before 2007.
Beckett : Where are you from?
Castle : Okay, Ward.
Beckett : Whatever you thought you were doing,
Beckett : it's over.
UNK: - CASTLE : What'd he say? - Nothing.
Castle : No apocalyptic visions?
Castle : No nightmarish warnings of dire things to come?
Beckett : Whatever delusions he has in his head, he is keeping them to himself.
Castle : Well, if nothing Doyle said was true, why else would Ward target Deschile?
ESPOSITO : I think we can answer that.
UNK: Paul Deschile : I'm the one who alerted security to Ward's behavior
UNK: Paul Deschile : at the energy conference six years ago.
UNK: Paul Deschile : They stopped him because of me.
Esposito : It looks like this was all just about revenge.
Paul : I'm just sorry it cost Dr. Wickfield his life.
Paul : You know, the talk he gave at that conference rocked my world.
Paul : And if it wasn't for him, I'd probably be doing
Paul : something completely different with my life.
Esposito : Come on, man, I'll walk you out.
Beckett : So, there is a simple explanation after all.
Castle : Yes. Now we know why Ward tried to bomb that conference.
