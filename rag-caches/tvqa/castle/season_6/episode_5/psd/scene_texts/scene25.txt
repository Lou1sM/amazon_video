UNK: Um...
Castle : Missed him.
UNK: Well, you know what?

Beckett : Talk to you tonight?
Castle : Sounds good.
UNK: GASPS
UNK: WHISPERS Jeez.
Castle : You're really doing this.
Simon : I am.
Castle : I know what you're thinking.
Castle : You're thinking I'm making a huge mistake.
Castle : What if you are?
Castle : This isn't something you can just go back and undo.
Castle : Why don't you wait a year, okay? Move into the dorms.
Castle : I'm sure Pi can take care of himself.
Castle : And if after a year, you still wanna move in together,
Castle : I won't say a word.
Alexis : Yes, you will.
Alexis : I don't know how this is gonna turn out, Dad.
Alexis : None of us do.
