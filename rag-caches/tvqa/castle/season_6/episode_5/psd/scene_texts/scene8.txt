Ryan : I'll tell you what, you tell us everything about that murderous friend of yours,

UNK: INHALES DEEPLY
UNK: His name's Ward. Garrett Ward.
UNK: MUTTERS He was my cellie at Five Points.
Ryan : Where can we find him?
UNK: EXHALES I don't know, man. He found me last week.
Lynden : Said he'd just gotten out, he needed a favor.
Lynden : I figured it was better to do it than end up on his hate list.
Esposito : You're afraid of him.
Lynden : Hell, yeah. Everyone was.
Lynden : I mean, this guy was inside a week, he was running the cell block.
