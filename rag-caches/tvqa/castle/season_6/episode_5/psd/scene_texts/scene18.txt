UNK: AUDIENCE APPLAUDS
HASTINGS : Yeah, I knew Garrett Ward.
Hasting : When he first came to us, he said all the right things.
Hasting : How big oil and coal were destroying our environment.
Hasting : He even helped me plan that sit-in on the energy conference.
UNK: After a few weeks, it became obvious he didn't care about the environment.
Hasting : When he was caught with that bomb, we realized why.
Castle : He was using you to get into the conference.
Beckett : So how well did you know him personally?
UNK: Enough to know he was nuts.
Castle : How so?
Hasting : He was paranoid.
UNK: He was always looking over his shoulder.
Hasting : And he'd say things about the future, messed up things,
Hasting : about apocalyptic wars,
Hasting : and how the human race needed to be cleansed.
Hasting : It was pretty creepy.
Beckett : Kind of like some of the predictions you just made?
Hasting : No, this was different.
Hasting : Ward talked about it like it was real, like it had already happened.
Castle : Did he ever say anything to you about a child?
Hasting : Not that I recall.
Castle : What about this guy? Do you recognize him?
UNK: Sorry.
Beckett : Do you know if there was anyone that he was close to?
Beckett : Anyone who would know how to find him?
Hasting : He burned every bridge he had when he walked in with that bomb.
Hasting : But if you're looking for him, I'd try the East River Power Plant.
Hasting : That's where he was living six years ago.
UNK: He said, uh, the electromagnetic field
Hasting : made it harder for the government to find him.
Hasting : I told you, the guy was crazy.
