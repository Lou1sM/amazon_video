Simon : I'm getting to that.
UNK: Look, look, I'm a temporal anthropologist.
UNK: What we do is we travel back in time and we study culturally significant eras.
Simon : Ancient Egypt, Middle Ages, man, I've been to Nazi Germany.
Castle : Aren't you worried about the butterfly effect?
UNK: Accidentally changing something in the past,
Castle : thus altering the future?
Simon : No. We're careful.
UNK: The time stream is mostly self-correcting, okay?
UNK: Any small change is like a little ripple in a fast-moving river, right?
UNK: - SNAPS FINGERS - It's gone in a second, doesn't matter.
Simon : But if someone was to do something big,
UNK: if somebody was to do something massive,
Simon : then yes, of course, damn right you could change the future.
UNK: And by the way, that's exactly what just happened.
UNK: Somebody broke into our lab, okay?
Simon : Made an unauthorized jump back in time.
UNK: We don't know who, but when they did, the numbers, they started to spike.
Simon : Not unlike a tide going out before a tsunami.
Castle : And what happens when the tsunami hits?
UNK: Well, it hasn't caught up to us yet, okay?
Simon : But when it does, whatever chain of events that has just started now
Simon : will result in billions of deaths that did not otherwise occur.
Simon : You understand me?
UNK: Okay, um, Mr. Doyle, let's say that you are indeed from the future.
UNK: How does Shauna Taylor fit into all of this?
Beckett : I mean, how does her death change things so radically?
Pi : I don't know.
UNK: All I know is that we traced the first change in the timeline
UNK: to her apartment, October 7th, 12 : 58 a.m.
Castle : Which is why they sent you back, why you accosted her.
