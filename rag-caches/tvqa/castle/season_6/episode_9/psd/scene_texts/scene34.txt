Matthews : Every time I hear a click, I'm right back with him.
UNK: How long do you think it's gonna take
Lanie : before we stop thinking about what he's done?
UNK: Till we stop looking at each other
Lanie : and seeing two dead people?
Beckett : I don't know.
Castle : You killed them both for Jerry Tyson.
UNK: Oh, I admire his work, but no. I'm my own man.
Beckett : And as your own man,
Beckett : you groomed them, paid for Pam's apartment,
Beckett : using the money from the Gregs-Baker account
Beckett : that you established in the Caymans.
Matthews : Yeah, that's right.
Beckett : You're lying.
Beckett : That account was opened in Belize, not the Caymans.
Castle : But you wouldn't know that because you aren't the one who opened it.
