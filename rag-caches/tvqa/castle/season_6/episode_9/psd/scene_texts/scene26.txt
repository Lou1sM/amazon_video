Nieman : You seek justice and I seek perfection.
UNK: In fact, whenever you're ready to take this to the next level,
UNK: WHISPERS you come see me.
UNK: DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES
UNK: I got nothing, Castle.
Beckett : I can't even tie her to the Florida murders
UNK: other than the fact that she was in the area when they occurred.
Castle : Can I say something that'll probably annoy you?
UNK: SIGHS
Beckett : Since when do you ask for permission?
UNK: TouchÃ©.
Castle : What if Dr. Nieman isn't our killer?
Beckett : Castle, you saw her in there. She was toying with me.
Beckett : She's involved in this. I can feel it.
Castle : I admit, she's not warm and cuddly, but that doesn't make her guilty.
Beckett : How can you, of all people, buy her story?
Castle : Because at this point, it makes more sense than ours does.
UNK: Just consider this.
