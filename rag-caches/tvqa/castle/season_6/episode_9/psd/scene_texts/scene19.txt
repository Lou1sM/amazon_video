UNK: Hey.
Esposito : Dude, we're having a moment here.
Ryan : Sorry. I found the strip club where Santos worked.
Ryan : They had a home address for him in Queens.
RYAN : So how you doing, man?
Epsosito : I'm fine. How are you?
Ryan : It's big, what you're dealing with.
UNK: I just wanna put it out there that I'm here for you.
Esposito : Good to know, man.
Ryan : The point is, sometimes talking about it helps.
Esposito : So what, you want me to share my feelings now?
Ryan : It's what a lot of people would do.
Esposito : All right, fine.
UNK: I wanna find this piece of garbage, string him up, and see how he likes it.
Esposito : There. I shared a feeling. Happy now?
Ryan : See? Don't you feel better?
UNK: Ryan...
UNK: All right. Super said that Daniel Santos hasn't been around here much lately.
WOMAN : Oh, my God.
UNK: Daniel?
Esposito : No. No, actually, uh, Detective Javier Esposito. NYPD.
UNK: Oh. CHUCKLES
Theresa : It's like seeing a ghost. You look so much like him.
