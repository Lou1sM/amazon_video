Esposito : Yeah. Um, so you knew Daniel?
UNK: Not as much as I wanted to, but a little. SNIFFLES
Theresa : Enough to know that he was better than what he did for a living.
UNK: We heard he quit that job for some big-time gig.
UNK: Do you have any idea what it was?
Theresa : He said he couldn't talk about it.
UNK: - Did people come visit him here? - CHUCKLES
Theresa : People didn't visit Daniel. It was more like the other way around.
Esposito : Meaning what?
UNK: I'd see him leave here and a limo would be waiting out front.
Ryan : Was this recently?
UNK: Yeah.
Theresa : One picked him up two nights ago.
Ryan : The same night he was killed.
Ryan : Do you remember what that vehicle looked like?
Theresa : It was black. I mean, it was just a regular Town Car.
Theresa : But there was blue around the license plate.
Esposito : Wait a minute. Do you mean blue neon?
Theresa : Yeah, that was it.
Esposito : Blue neon license plate frames.
Esposito : That's the trademark of Blue Moon Limos.
