UNK: CLICKS TONGUE
UNK: All right. I've had a good run.
Beckett : How many are there?
Matthews : Way north of four, if that's what you're asking.
UNK: Tell me about Pam Hodges.
Matthews : She was a fighter.
Matthews : And the look on her face, she wanted to live so bad.
Matthews : I stood her on a shipping pallet and then pulled it away.
UNK: And her feet were just off the ground.
Matthews : I remember the toes of her shoes scuffing the wood.
Matthews : All panicky and fast at first.
Matthews : And then slower.
Matthews : And then not at all.
Beckett : And what about Daniel Santos?
Matthews : With Daniel, I used the reel.
Matthews : So, with each click, I drew in a quarter-inch of line.
Matthews : It got tighter, and then lifted him bit by bit.
