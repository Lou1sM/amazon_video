Esposito : What kind of sicko is doing this?
Lanie : I went through every case we worked on. Nothing jumped out.
UNK: Yeah. Not for me, either.
UNK: But it's gotta be... It's gotta be something personal.
Esposito : It's gotta be someone who knows about our relationship.
Lanie : Well, whoever he is, he's a freak. He made Daniel Santos suffer.

UNK: The killer used that fishing reel to kill him slowly.
UNK: So who is he gonna go after now?
Lanie : You and me?
Lanie : Some version of Ryan and Beckett? What if this is just the beginning?
UNK: Hey.
UNK: It'll be okay, I promise. I won't let anything happen to you.
Lanie : Yeah? What if something happens to you?
