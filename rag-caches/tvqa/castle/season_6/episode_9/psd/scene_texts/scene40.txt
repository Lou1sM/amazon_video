UNK: - BECKETT : Okay, all right. Thanks. - CELL PHONE BEEPS
Beckett : So all of the electronic records from the 3XK cases were deleted, too.
Beckett : Not only that,
UNK: but it looks like our victims took evidence and files
UNK: from 26 other unsolved murders.
Castle : More murders committed by Tyson?
Beckett : Or Kelly Nieman.
Beckett : I don't know, Castle, I'm starting to think she'd be capable of it, too.
Castle : Tyson sure did pick the right woman.
Castle : Plus, she can change his appearance. Maybe she already has.
Beckett : You're still assuming that he's alive.
Castle : Aren't you?
Castle : He must be. Otherwise why orchestrate all this to steal the files?
Beckett : Well, maybe she just wanted to keep his memory alive.
Beckett : Or his legacy.
Castle : That makes her just as dangerous as he is.
Castle : And she's still out there somewhere, with Jerry Tyson or without him.
