UNK: So somebody could've been aware of his travel plans.
Castle : It's also possible, if the killer knew boats, uh,
Castle : they were looking for telltale signs the boat wasn't in use.
Beckett : Yeah, that's probably why he picked it, sir.
Beckett : He knew he could kill Daniel Santos undisturbed.
UNK: Well, what do we know about Mr. Santos?
Beckett : He moved here from Georgia about a year ago, uh...
Beckett : I'm still trying to find a current address. I did speak with his parents.
UNK: They told me that he worked as a male stripper.
Beckett : Three months ago,
Beckett : he called his parents to tell them that he quit stripping
UNK: and he had landed a big-time gig.
Gates : Did they know what this gig was?
Beckett : No. He was vague, just like Pam Hodges.
Gates : Okay. So, I need you, Detective Esposito, and Dr. Parish
Gates : to go over all the cases that you worked together.
Gates : See if anyone connected to them presents as a suspect.
Esposito : Yes, sir.
Gates : For the sake of these victims, and our own people,
Gates : find this killer.
UNK: CLEARS THROAT
Castle : I still don't get it.
Castle : Why would someone kill clones of Esposito and Lanie?
UNK: I mean, is it some kind of warning?
Beckett : Maybe if we dig deeper into Daniel Santos' life, we'll figure it out.
UNK: I think I've got a lead as to what he was up to.
Beckett : According to his prepaid debit card records,
Beckett : he bought a latte at the same Midtown building
Beckett : every Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoon.
UNK: As if he was keeping some kind of regular appointment?
Castle : He did.
Beckett : According to the doorman, he was meeting with a Dr. LAN Fuller.
