Ryan : Guys, I think I found something in those prison records that got sent over.
Ryan : Do you remember, right before he was released from prison,
Ryan : Tyson got beat up by some inmates?
Beckett : Yeah, that's why we pulled him out of there.
Beckett : We thought his life was in danger,
Beckett : but it turns out he just staged the whole thing.
Ryan : Right, but the beat down was real. He got sent to the infirmary.
Ryan : Look who was attending him.
CASTLE : Dr. Kelly Nieman?
Ryan : She volunteered as a prison doc.
Ryan : More importantly, she started there the week Tyson arrived,
UNK: and she quit the day he was released.
Castle : She knew him from before.
Castle : She took that job to be close to him. She's gotta be Tyson's girlfriend.
Beckett : He taught her everything he knew. Get her back here.
Ryan : She's not answering her cell, and she's not at her apartment either.
UNK: Damn it!
Esposito : This explains why you couldn't reach her. She bolted.
Ryan : And if Tyson's in this, he did, too.
UNK: It seems like only yesterday this place was a thriving medical practice.
Castle : It was yesterday.
Beckett : We still gotta clear the place.
