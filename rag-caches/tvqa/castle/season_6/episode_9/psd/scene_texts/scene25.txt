Nieman : Let me ask you something.
Nieman : Has it occurred to you that I'm being set up here?
Beckett : Set up by whom?
UNK: Maybe whoever did this knew of my connection to Daniel and Pam.
Nieman : Maybe this was part of their plan to waste your time and mine.
Beckett : I doubt that.
Nieman : You'll never prove that I was at those docks. Or some marina.
Nieman : Because I wasn't.
Nieman : Besides, what possible motive would I have for killing anyone?
Nieman : I've dated lawyers.
Nieman : I know that if you don't charge me, I can leave.
Nieman : No hard feelings, Detective.
Nieman : We're both professionals. You're just doing your job.
