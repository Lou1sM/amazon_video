Beckett : The doorman at her building confirms that Santos visited two nights ago.
CASTLE : And not for the first time.
Castle : He said Santos was a frequent overnight guest of the good doctor.
Beckett : Which directly connects her to both of our victims.
Gates : So are we to believe that Kelly Nieman overpowered Santos,
Gates : a young man in his prime?
UNK: Oh, she was more than capable. According to her bio,
UNK: she has a black belt in both tae Kwon do and jiu jitsu.
BECKETT : She also has boating experience and grew up in Florida.
Beckett : In fact, she was in Miami at a conference
Beckett : at the time of the other two murders.
Gates : Do we have any hard evidence linking her to these murders?
Beckett : It's been clear from the beginning that our killer is very careful.
UNK: So, the answer's no.
UNK: SIGHS
Gates : This entire case is circumstantial.
UNK: Which means you're gonna need to break her.
UNK: And you got one shot.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
Beckett : Dr. Nieman, thank you for coming in.
Nieman : Was I offered a choice?
UNK: I wanted to ask you a few questions
