Beckett : There's something that we're missing here, Castle.
Beckett : Two similar murders in Florida. Our victim also from Florida.
Beckett : But then there's this whole Lanie and her look-alike angle.
Beckett : How does that fit in?
Castle : I have no idea.
Ryan : Hey. We got a hit on those cheek implants.
Ryan : They were traced to a Manhattan cosmetic surgeon.
UNK: A Dr. Kelly Nieman.
Castle : Well, I, for one, am very interested in what Dr. Nieman has to say.
RYAN : In the meantime, Lanie wants to give her statement to Esposito.
ESPOSITO : You're not a perp, Lanie.
Esposito : Doesn't seem right, us talking in here like this.
Lanie : I wanted to be somewhere private, so let's get on with this, okay?
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Um...
Esposito : So, can you think of anyone who would do a thing like this?
UNK: No.
UNK: SIGHS
Esposito : Who've you been with in the last six months?
Esposito : Besides me, I mean. I know we're not exclusive.
Beckett : No one.
Esposito : I need the truth, whatever it is.
Lanie : I'm telling you the truth.
UNK: Then how did they know about the tattoo?
Esposito : You've only had it three months, right? No one can see it unless you're naked.
UNK: Well, did you happen to mention it to anyone?
Esposito : Of course not.
Lanie : You are the only person I ever showed it to.
UNK: STAMMERING Wait. Still, something's not right.
Esposito : This doesn't make sense.
Esposito : Come on, Lanie.
Esposito : Think. Someone got close to you.
Esposito : Someone saw that tattoo.
Esposito : Now, who was it?
