Gates : It's an embarrassment.
Beckett : Sir, if a detective were to suggest that Tyson,
Beckett : a man that the department's already declared dead, might still be alive...
Gates : An even bigger embarrassment.
UNK: So if you're gonna make that claim,
Gates : make damn sure you can back it up.
Beckett : I will keep that in mind, sir.
Castle : What was that about?
Beckett : That if Tyson is alive, the NYPD doesn't wanna know about it.
Castle : And what about you? You think he's back?
UNK: Castle, people don't just rise from the dead.
Beckett : So I'm still looking at other explanations.
Beckett : But if he is out there, we have to find him.
UNK: We're not gonna get any more out of Carl Matthews.
Castle : So, where do we start?
