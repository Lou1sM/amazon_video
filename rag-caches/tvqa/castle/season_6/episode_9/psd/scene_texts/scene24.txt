UNK: Around 10 : 00.
Beckett : Daniel Santos spent his last day with you.
Beckett : Pam Hodges was a patient of yours.
Beckett : They're both murdered,
UNK: and the only person that they have in common is you.
Beckett : Now you don't expect me to believe that that's a coincidence, do you?
Nieman : It's not a coincidence at all. Daniel referred Pam to me as a patient.
Beckett : So they knew each other? We don't have any evidence of that.
Nieman : Well, I'm sure you'll find some if you keep looking.
UNK: When Pam came in, she said that he'd recommended her to me.
