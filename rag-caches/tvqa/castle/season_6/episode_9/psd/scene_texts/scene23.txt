Beckett : about your relationship with Daniel Santos.
Nieman : I no longer have one.
Beckett : So you are aware that he's dead.
Nieman : I watch the news.
Beckett : You don't seem terribly upset by it.
UNK: Well, I suppose I could fake it. Or lie.
UNK: But that's just as tedious for you as it is for me.
Nieman : It was purely physical with us.
Nieman : You really are a beautiful woman.
Nieman : But not perfect.
Nieman : I could fix you.
Beckett : Where did you go after he came to your apartment?
UNK: Hmm. We stayed in.
Beckett : You didn't go by a marina?
Nieman : I don't have a boat.
Beckett : And yet his body was found on one.
Beckett : And prior to that, he was at your apartment.
Nieman : Yes, but then he left my place.
UNK: When?
