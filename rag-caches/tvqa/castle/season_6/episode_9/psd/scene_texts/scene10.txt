UNK: GASPS Oh, my God.
UNK: What?
Lanie : I had a weird night two months back.
Esposito : Weird how?
Lanie : Someone at work got promoted,
Lanie : and a bunch of us hit a nightclub to celebrate.
Lanie : And some hot jazz was going, so I stayed late.
Lanie : When I woke up the next day, I couldn't remember how I got home.
UNK: Whoa, whoa. Since when do you go busting your two-drink limit?
Lanie : I don't. And I didn't that night, either.
