Beckett : Reports, lab work, DNA, tissue samples
Beckett : of every suspected 3XK victim
UNK: were checked out. By Lanie.
Esposito : Only not the real Lanie.
Ryan : Are you saying the son of a bitch is back?
Castle : That explains the look-alikes.
Esposito : And why Santos tried to sound like me.
Castle : It's not enough that Jerry Tyson disappeared.
Castle : He wanted his murders to disappear, too.
Castle : And it's not just evidence, it's his MOs,
Castle : victim preferences,
Castle : all the hundreds of tiny case details that could reveal psychology
Castle : as to where he is, where he might be going next.
Castle : It's all gone,
Castle : like he's got a clean slate.
Beckett : Maybe not completely clean.
Beckett : Call the prison where Tyson did time.
Beckett : Have them secure his records before they disappear, too.
Beckett : And then have them send us the copies.
Ryan : Oh, I'm all over it.
Gates : A cruiser just spotted Matthews' car at the Starburst Motel in Queens.
Castle : That's the same motel where we put up Jerry Tyson.
UNK: MAN COUGHING
UNK: Thanks. Front desk says he's in Room 47.
Castle : That's the same room Tyson was in.
UNK: Yeah.
ESPOSITO : There's his car.
Esposito : Light's out in Room 47.
Beckett : Listen, Castle, we don't know what's waiting for us up there.
Beckett : You stay here, okay?
Castle : You be careful.
Beckett : Let's go.
UNK: Swat Team Member : - Police! - NYPD!
UNK: RAPID FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
UNK: GRUNTS
Castle : Where is 3XK? Where is he?
Gates : How are you, Detective?
Esposito : Depends on how things go down with Carl Matthews.
UNK: FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
Gates : I'll give you two the room.
UNK: WHISPERS Sir.
Lanie : What kind of twisted bastard murders two people for some files?
Esposito : That kind.
Lanie : Do we have proof that he killed them?
Castle : Not enough.
UNK: So what's gonna happen?
UNK: We make him think that our case is stronger than it really is.
Esposito : Get him to confess. That's our only play.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
