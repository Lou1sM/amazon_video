UNK: She stayed at my place for a few weeks when she moved to the city.
UNK: Do you know why she came to town, Mr. Hodges?
Calvin : Well, she said she needed a fresh start. And she had a job offer.
Ryan : Doing what?
Calvin : I was afraid Pam would start working the streets again.
Calvin : She burned a lot of bridges by telling the family she would go straight
Calvin : and never doing it.
Calvin : But this time was different.
Calvin : Pam moved out of my house when she said she would.
Calvin : She started working a job.
Calvin : A few months back I met her for lunch,
Calvin : and I almost didn't recognize her, she looked so good.
UNK: I mean, Pam was happy.
Calvin : She said this new job was just what she needed.
Ryan : What do you know about this job? Where did she work?
Calvin : She wouldn't talk about it much.
