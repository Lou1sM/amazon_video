UNK: Richard Castle : Where we can just hang. Don't you think?
UNK: Kate Beckett : Before we plan the honeymoon, shouldn't we set a wedding date first?
UNK: No, 'cause the department hasn't even said if you can have time off yet.
Castle : Besides, planning a honeymoon will help us set a date.
UNK: Okay. Can't wait to hear about this.
UNK: Well, you don't wanna go to Thailand during monsoon season, do you?
Castle : Or New Zealand in the winter?
UNK: No. You decide where you wanna go, the best time to be there.
Castle : Boom. Lobby for those dates.
Castle : New Zealand?
Beckett : Castle, are you using our honeymoon as an excuse
UNK: to go and tour Middle-earth?
UNK: WHISPERS I'm game if you are.
Beckett : I was hoping for something more romantic and less hobbit-y.
Castle : Why does everyone always think those two are mutually exclusive?
