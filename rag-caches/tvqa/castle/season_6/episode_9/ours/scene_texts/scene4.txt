Ryan : So just a few hours before she was killed.
Ryan : Let's locate that marina and find out who owns that boat.
Beckett : NYPD. I need...
MAN : I'm sorry, do you have an appointment?
UNK: We're here to see a Dr. Nieman.
Bryce : Can I ask what this is regarding?
UNK: No.
Bryce : I'm sorry, Dr. Nieman. I apologize for the intrusion. This is...
Beckett : Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.
UNK: Dr. Kelly Nieman : Uh, please come in. Have a seat.
UNK: DOOR CLOSES
Nieman : As a tireless self-promoter, let me offer you one of my pens.
Beckett : No, thank you. We're just here to ask you a few questions.
Nieman : Oh, can I just say, you have an amazing face, Detective.
Beckett : And what about, uh... What about my face?
UNK: Uh... Amazing potential.
Beckett : Why don't we talk about Pam Hodges' face,
Beckett : and the fact that she was murdered?
Nieman : Jesus. What happened?
Beckett : She was one of your patients, is that correct?
UNK: Uh, yes. Yes, I performed some refinements.
UNK: And at whose behest?
UNK: Hers.
Nieman : She actually brought me a picture of a friend of hers.
Nieman : They had similar facial structure,
Nieman : and Pam wanted to look a bit more like her friend.
Beckett : Let me get this straight.
UNK: So people come in and ask to look like other people,
Beckett : and you just do it?
Nieman : Well, it's not unusual for patients to bring me photos,
Nieman : usually of models or actors, for reference.
Castle : And these photos she showed you, where were they taken?
Nieman : They looked like snapshots from a bar or a club, as I recall.
Beckett : Did she ever come here with anyone? Um...
UNK: Did she ever mention any of the men in her life?
Nieman : - No, I'm afraid not. - CELL PHONE BUZZING
Castle : And who was it that paid for these new cheeks of hers?
Nieman : She did. With a company check.
UNK: From Gregs-Baker?
Nieman : I'd have to look, but that sounds right.
UNK: Uh, excuse me.
UNK: - CELL PHONE BEEPS - Beckett.
UNK: - Okay. Seriously. "Amazing potential"? - DOOR OPENS
Nieman : And I'd love to help you realize it.
UNK: WHISPERS Wow.
Beckett : Yeah. Hey.
RYAN : We tracked down that marina from the photo.
Ryan : It's Windward Cove in Long Island. We're here right now.
Beckett : Whose boat was Pam on?
Ryan : It's registered out of Florida to a Rudy Hollings.
Beckett : Okay, so what do we know about him?
Ryan : Not a damn thing,
UNK: except for Pam was on his boat that night she was murdered.
Ryan : We're about to board. I'll call you when it's secure.
UNK: 'Kay.
RYAN : NYPD!
UNK: - ESPOSITO : NYPD! - Police!
UNK: Got a suspect up ahead! Twelve o' clock!
UNK: Swat Team Member : - Let me see your hands! - Let me see your hands right now!
UNK: Swat Team Member : Let me see your hands!
Ryan : Show me your hands! Right now!
UNK: - Let me see your hands now! - Hands! Right now!
UNK: What?
Ryan : Espo, go outside. Don't look, man.
Esposito : What do you mean? What are you talking about, go outside?
Esposito : Huh? Let me see.
