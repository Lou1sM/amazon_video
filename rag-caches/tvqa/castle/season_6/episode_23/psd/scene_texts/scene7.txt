Castle : You think Rogan's ex will be able to help us find him?
Beckett : They lived together. If we're lucky, she'll be able to tell us
Beckett : what kind of mess he was mixed up in.
WOMAN : Can I help you?
BECKETT : Uh...
Beckett : Hi, ma'am.
Beckett : NYPD. We're looking for Rogan O'Leary.
Cloris : Well, if you find him, you can keep him.
UNK: - DOOR OPENS - TILDY : Stop it, Mama.
Tildy : You were in the bar yesterday.
Beckett : Yeah. I was hoping that Mr. O'Leary could help us with an old case,
Beckett : but it seems that he was abducted last night.
Tildy : By who?
Castle : We were hoping you could tell us.
UNK: Wasn't me! I'd have offed him.
Tildy : Mama, that's enough.
Beckett : Look, he was taken by two men in a rusty pickup truck.
Beckett : Do you have any idea who they were?
Tildy : No. But he's always working crazy angles, pissing people off.
Castle : Is that why you left him?
UNK: No. CHUCKLES
Tildy : I was used to that.
Tildy : But he took money from me for one of his schemes.
UNK: Said he was gonna make us rich. He lost it all, of course.
Tildy : And now I might lose the bar.
Tildy : The thing is, in spite of it all,
Tildy : I love him.
Tildy : I mean, I can overlook the fact that he's not a "regular job" kind of guy,
Tildy : or that he can't marry me while his wife's in a coma,
