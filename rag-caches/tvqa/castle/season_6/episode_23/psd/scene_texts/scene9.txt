Tildy : Said he needed it right away.
Castle : Did he say why?
Tildy : No. But since it's my laptop, I figured it was a line of bull,
Tildy : that he wanted me to give it up so he could sell it for the money.
Castle : Given how anxious he was to get his hands on it,
Castle : it might have something to do with his abduction.
Beckett : Tildy, could we borrow that laptop?
Beckett : Might help us find him.
Castle : We are trained professionals,
Castle : and Rogan might be in some very, very serious trouble.
UNK: - ENGINE REVS - BECKETT : He's in trouble all right!
Beckett : I mean, all these years, he knew that we were married!
Beckett : He knew when I got here.
UNK: And for 15 years, he's been using that as an excuse not to commit.
Castle : Coma wife.
UNK: CHUCKLES It's kind of brilliant.
Beckett : You mean despicable, right?
Castle : Yeah. That's what I meant.
Beckett : Did you find anything on the laptop?
Castle : Their e-mails to each other are fairly pornographic,
Castle : but nothing that would get a man abducted.
Beckett : You know what? Maybe we should call Tory and have her access it remotely.
Beckett : See if we're missing anything.
Castle : And we should re-check Rogan's apartment.
Castle : See if there's anything there that can tell us what he was involved with.
UNK: I gotta call Lanie.
UNK: I'm not gonna make my spa bachelorette party this afternoon.
UNK: You were gonna have naked ladies at your party, too? Wow.
UNK: Do what you need to do, girl.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Operation Hamptons is in full swing,
UNK: Lanie Parish : and we'll have a newlyweds' spa day
UNK: Lanie Parish : when you get back from your honeymoon.
UNK: Yeah, Lanie, look, I don't know when we're gonna get back,
Beckett : so can you go to my place, pick up the dress, and take it up with you tonight?
