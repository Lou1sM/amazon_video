Martha : Ah, hi, Gerard. Put them over there with the others. Thank you.
Castle : All right. I'm out.
UNK: Bye.
Alexis : Dad! Don't forget the forms for the marriage license.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Those are my case files.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Ask your questions,
UNK: Kate Beckett : because I will be pretty much unreachable for the next three weeks.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Okay. What are you more excited about, the wedding or the honeymoon?
UNK: Javier Esposito : Three weeks in the Maldives on a private island? What do you think?
UNK: Actually, the only thing that I'm not excited about
Beckett : is having to say my vows in front of all those people.
Ryan : You'll be fine. Just imagine your wedding guests are murder suspects.
Esposito : In their underwear.
Beckett : Or not.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : You know, I was so nervous before my wedding
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : that I ran into a wall and got a black eye.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : You're supposed to be a wreck.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : You're about to experience one of the most important days of your life.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : I'm so happy for you, Detective.
Castle : Hey, guys!
Gates : In spite of who you're marrying.
UNK: So, who's ready to get her marriage license?
UNK: Me. Almost. I gotta get my bag.
UNK: Excellent. And Alexis wanted me to remind you...
Esposito : She called, she texted and she e-mailed. We will be there.
Ryan : And we'll bring our black shoes.
Beckett : Do you have our paperwork?
UNK: "I do."
Castle : I'm just practicing. CHUCKLES
UNK: I... I do. I got it.
Ryan : Have fun, guys.
Beckett : T-minus 72 hours until we are married.
Beckett : This feels like a dream.
UNK: - That's 'cause I'm dreamy. - Oh, shush.
UNK: Kate Beckett : - Next! - Ah.
UNK: CLEARS THROAT
UNK: Here we are.
Clerk : Mr. Richard Castle and Ms. Katherine Beckett.
Castle : That's us.
Clerk : Proof of divorce?
Castle : Is there something wrong with my documents?
Clerk : They're in order. Ms. Beckett, do you have yours?
Beckett : - Pardon me? - Your divorce paperwork.
UNK: CHUCKLING I'm sorry, there's a mistake.
Beckett : I've never been married.
Clerk : Well, according to this, you have. And it looks like you still are.
Beckett : I'm married?
Castle : To whom?
MARTHA : Rogan O'Leary?
Martha : Well, who is Rogan O'Leary?
Castle : A guy she met freshman year at Stanford.
UNK: Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.
Alexis : And you married him?
Beckett : Not really.
Castle : Except she did.
Castle : The two of them drove to Vegas, had too much to drink,
Castle : and thought it would be a riot to take a cab to a drive-through wedding chapel.
Martha : - You didn't. - She did.
Beckett : Yeah, I did. But I never thought that it was for real.
Beckett : And I broke up with the guy a couple weeks later,
Beckett : after I found out he was a compulsive liar, degenerate and a thief.
Castle : Yes, but not before you tied the knot.
Castle : And here I thought you were a one-and-done kind of girl.
Martha : Does your father know about this?
UNK: - I really am gonna be sick. - DOORBELL BUZZES
UNK: And that would be my lawyer.
BROWNING : You were both over 18.
UNK: Henry Browning : Regardless of your seriousness or intent at the time,
UNK: Henry Browning : I'm afraid your wedding at the Drive-Thru of Love
UNK: Henry Browning : was real, legal and binding.
UNK: Okay, we are getting married in three days.
Browning : I'm afraid you can't. Not unless you terminate your first marriage.
Beckett : We have 300 people coming. Most of them are flying in.
UNK: So, what are we gonna say to all of them?
Castle : Henry, is there anything we can do to make this go away?
Browning : It's possible, if there's mutual consent.
Browning : I brought a dissolution-of-marriage contract,
Browning : and I could expedite it through the city, but...
Browning : You'll have to get Mr. O'Leary to sign it, too.
UNK: How? It's been 15 years. I have no idea where he is.
UNK: Okay, looks like we found him.
Ryan : But, man, is your
Ryan : - husband a piece of work. - Mmm.
Beckett : He's not my husband.
Castle : Except, legally, he is.
Beckett : So, what do we know about him?
Esposito : Well, your boy got around. He was charged with theft in Austin in '05.
UNK: He did time for a DUI in Iowa in '07.
RYAN : He was arrested for fraud in Kentucky, and...
Ryan : Oh, this is a good one.
Ryan : He was put in jail for impersonating an FBI agent in New Orleans.
Castle : I must say, given his record,
Castle : I'm really surprised you stayed with him all these years.
Beckett : Do you know where he is now?
Ryan : Yeah, it looks like he settled in a small town in upstate New York
Ryan : called Willow Creek about five years ago.
Beckett : - Do you have his contact information? - Texting right now.
UNK: FEMALE VOICE : The voice mail for...
ROGAN : Rogan O'Leary.
UNK: FEMALE VOICE : Is full. Please try again later.
Beckett : I'm not getting through. Either the phone rings incessantly,
UNK: or I get the "voice mail is full" message.
Castle : So, what do you want to do?
Beckett : I want to get married.
Castle : - What do you want to do? - I want to get married, too.
Beckett : Okay! Then it's settled.
Beckett : You'll stay here and keep the wedding on track.
Alexis : And you?
UNK: I'm gonna go to Willow Creek.
Beckett : I've got less than three days to find Rogan O'Leary and get a divorce.
UNK: - DOOR OPENS - SIGHS
Neighbor : He's not worth it.
Beckett : Pardon me?
Neighbor : Sweetie, I've been his neighbor for five years.
Neighbor : He's got a smile that will make your pants fall off.
Neighbor : But trust me, he's trouble.
Beckett : Do you know where I can find him?
Neighbor : Don't say I didn't warn you.
UNK: ROCK MUSIC PLAYS
Beckett : Excuse me.
Beckett : Hi, I'm looking for one of your bartenders. Rogan O'Leary?
UNK: MAN SCREAMING
UNK: Come on, Tildy!
UNK: GLASS SHATTERS
Beckett : - Never mind. - Give me a break!
TILDY : You want a break? I'll give you a break.
UNK: Oh... EXHALES SHARPLY
UNK: What the hell did I do?
Tildy : What did you do? How about what didn't you do?
Tildy : I thought you came here to apologize, to tell me how sorry you are.
Tildy : But, no! All you want is your stuff back?
Tildy : It's not even your stuff!
Rogan : It's our stuff! And I need it to make things right.
Tildy : I'm through! Now get out of my bar!
Rogan : Come on, babe.
UNK: CHUCKLING You know you don't mean that.
Rogan : You love me too much.
PATRONS : Oh!
Tildy : How's that for love?
UNK: SIGHS
UNK: EXHALES
UNK: Kit Kat?
UNK: CHUCKLES Is that you?
Beckett : Hello, Rogan.
UNK: So, I see you haven't changed.
UNK: CHUCKLES Oh, what? That? Nah!
UNK: Come on. That was just...
UNK: That was just a lovers' quarrel, as they say.
UNK: GROANS
UNK: GROANS
UNK: So, Kit Kat, what brings you to Willow Creek, huh?
Rogan : You walking the nostalgia trail?
Rogan : Tracking down old flames to discover who you really are?
UNK: Uh... No. Do you remember a trip that we took to Vegas?
UNK: EXHALES DEEPLY
Rogan : I don't know, it's a little fuzzy.
Rogan : But most of my best memories are. LAUGHS
Beckett : So, when we were there, do you recall a cab ride and a drive-up chapel?
Rogan : Nope, but I do recall the dine-and-dash on the Strip.
UNK: LAUGHING Huh? Do you remember that? With the hoagies?
UNK: At the counter... "Hey, you! Get outta there!"
UNK: Well, you know what? You're probably gonna find this funny.
