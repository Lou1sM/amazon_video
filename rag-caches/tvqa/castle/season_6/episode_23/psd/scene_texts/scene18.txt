UNK: LAUGHS
UNK: Good one, Kit Kat. That's hilarious.
Beckett : I'm not joking. If you want me to cut you loose, then sign the papers.
Castle : I'll sign the papers when we're out of here.
Beckett : Sign them. Now.
Rogan : What, you don't trust me?
Castle : In fairness, you did blackmail a pastor.
UNK: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.
Rogan : Don't you want to hear my side of it?
Beckett : I don't care about your side.
Beckett : I just want you to sign these papers.
Castle : You know, maybe we should wait to do this till we get somewhere safe.
Rogan : Yes! Listen to Man Parts. Let's get the hell out of here.
Beckett : So you can disappear again, or get kidnapped? No.
UNK: Just sign these papers. Right now. On the dotted line.
Rogan : You don't understand. Those guys are gonna kill me.
Beckett : Over blackmail photos? They're not gonna kill you, Rogan.
Castle : Though, if you think about it, that would solve our problem.
Rogan : Listen, this isn't about the pastor, okay?
Rogan : There were other photos on that stripper's phone.
Rogan : Photos that had something to do with her boyfriend.
Crystal : Jimmy Lutz?
Rogan : Yeah. But I don't think that's his real name.
Rogan : I mean, the Ugly Brothers, they always called him something else.
UNK: Like, Barbozza something.
