Beckett : Hey! It's Beckett.
Beckett : Yeah, I need you guys to set up remote access to scrub a laptop.
Beckett : Castle, can you look up the address to The Roadhouse?
Beckett : I want to know what was on that stripper's phone.
Castle : Find a local strip bar? Now, that I know how to do.
Sapphire : Look, I don't know what you're talking about. No one stole my phone.
Beckett : - Are you sure? - Yeah.
Sapphire : It's right here. See?
Castle : Is there anything on it that anyone might want?
Sapphire : It's just a phone.
Sapphire : What is this all about?
Beckett : Do you know a guy named Rogan O'Leary?
UNK: Can't help ya. Sorry.
Beckett : Wait, Sapphire. Please. He might be in real trouble.
Beckett : So if you know something that can help us find him...
Sapphire : Look, if you don't want a dance, then I need to move on.
Beckett : - She knows something. - Well, whatever it is,
Castle : - she doesn't want to tell us. - CELLPHONE RINGING
Beckett : And I don't have the jurisdiction to make her.
Castle : - Beckett. - Kate? It's me.
Beckett : Lanie? What's wrong?
UNK: I went to your apartment to pick up your dress, and...
UNK: Javier Esposito : And what?
Lanie : Kate, a pipe burst in the apartment above, and...
Beckett : Oh, no. No, don't tell me.
Lanie : I tried, sweetie. I did everything that I could,
Lanie : but there was just too much damage.
UNK: Kate? The dress...
Lanie : It's gone!
UNK: SIGHS
Castle : It's only a dress. It's not the end of the world.
UNK: VOICE BREAKING Then why does it feel like it is?
Beckett : Our wedding was supposed to be magical!
UNK: It was supposed to be our perfect day.
