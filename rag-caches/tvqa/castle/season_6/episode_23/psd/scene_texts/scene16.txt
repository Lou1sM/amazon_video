Castle : Check out the barn.
Beckett : - Looks like we found our kidnappers. - Then we should call the police.
Beckett : - And tell them what? - That they have guns.
Beckett : On their own property, which is their constitutional right.
Beckett : We don't have proof that they have Rogan.

UNK: Yet? What do you mean, "yet"?
Beckett : Come on, Castle. Let's see if that's where they're keeping him.
UNK: SEATBELT CLICKS
Beckett : Do you want to get married tomorrow, or not?
