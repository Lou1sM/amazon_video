UNK: CELLPHONE RINGS
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Tory Ellis : Hey, it's Tory. I think I may have found something.
UNK: - CELLPHONE BEEPS - I was scrubbing the laptop,
UNK: and came across a hidden folder.
Beckett : What's in it?
UNK: Pictures.
Tory : According to image data,
Tory : they were recently downloaded from someone's phone.
Tory : Most of them are innocuous, but there are a couple of them
UNK: that, um, I think you need to see.
Tory : I'm e-mailing them now.
UNK: Oh-ho-ho-ho!
UNK: - Oh-ho-ho! - What?
Beckett : I think I know why your scheming, scamming husband
Beckett : wanted to steal that stripper's phone. Check it out.
Beckett : It's a guy with a stripper. What's the big deal?
Beckett : What's the big deal?
Castle : That is the big deal.
Castle : It's the local pastor.
Castle : There's only one reason
Castle : your husband would pay that much to get these photos.
Castle : He was blackmailing a man of God.
Beckett : A pastor with skin in the game.
Castle : And motive to make Rogan disappear.
BECKETT : Thank you for meeting with us, Pastor.
UNK: Pastor Bob : Well, you said on the phone it was urgent,
UNK: Pastor Bob : and helping people is my calling.
Castle : Does that include helping people out of their clothes
Castle : while they're sitting on your lap?
UNK: Pastor Bob : Where did you get those?
Beckett : I think you already know the answer to that.
UNK: Pastor Bob : I suppose you want money, too.
UNK: Pastor Bob : I am a pastor, not a bank!
Castle : We're not here to blackmail you.
UNK: Pastor Bob : You're not?
UNK: PASTOR BOB : It started six months ago.
UNK: I had a moment of weakness.
UNK: Pastor Bob : That stripper got photos of me.
UNK: Pastor Bob : It's been a nightmare ever since.
UNK: $1,000 here, $500 there.
Beckett : So, Sapphire was blackmailing you, not Rogan?
UNK: At first. Then Rogan must've found out.
UNK: Pastor Bob : He got his hands on the photos somehow.
UNK: Pastor Bob : He said if I gave him $25,000, he would make them disappear forever,
