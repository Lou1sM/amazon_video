UNK: and if I didn't, he would release them to the Willow Creek Register.
UNK: So, is that why you kidnapped him? To get those photos back?
UNK: Pastor Bob : What? No, I didn't kidnap him!
UNK: Pastor Bob : What kind of a man do you think I am?
UNK: I think we have a pretty good picture. May have a few pictures, actually.
UNK: No, I was going to pay him. I swear. Look.
UNK: Pastor Bob : I was supposed to meet him here this morning with the money.
UNK: Pastor Bob : He was going to hand over the laptop and the photos,
UNK: Pastor Bob : but he never showed.
UNK: - DOOR OPENS - CHUCKLES
UNK: Uh, be right with you, Mrs. Monroe.
Beckett : So you have no idea where Rogan is, or who might've taken him?
UNK: Pastor Bob : No. But if you find him,
UNK: Pastor Bob : tell him I am ready to pay.
UNK: Pastor Bob : I just want this to end.
UNK: Pastor Bob : Thank you for waiting, Mrs. Monroe.
Castle : So, your husband is hijacking someone else's blackmail.
Castle : Kind of ingenious, in a degenerate sort of way.
Beckett : Not if you're Sapphire.
Beckett : If you're Sapphire, you're pissed that you lost your income stream,
Beckett : and you want those photos back.
Crystal : I'm sorry, but Sapphire's gone.
Crystal : She bolted right after she talked to you guys.
UNK: Bitch stuck me with her shift.
Beckett : Do you know where we could find her?
Crystal : You could try her boyfriend's place. They sort of live together.
Crystal : His name's Jimmy Lutz.
Crystal : He's got a farm off Route 183.
UNK: We really should tip.
UNK: BIRD SQUAWKS
UNK: ENGINE SHUTS OFF
UNK: And there it is.
Beckett : That's the truck.
Beckett : The one that took Rogan. Here.
