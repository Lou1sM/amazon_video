Beckett : Not if you're Sapphire.
Beckett : If you're Sapphire, you're pissed that you lost your income stream,
Beckett : and you want those photos back.
Crystal : I'm sorry, but Sapphire's gone.
Crystal : She bolted right after she talked to you guys.
UNK: Bitch stuck me with her shift.
Beckett : Do you know where we could find her?
Crystal : You could try her boyfriend's place. They sort of live together.
Crystal : His name's Jimmy Lutz.
Crystal : He's got a farm off Route 183.
UNK: We really should tip.
UNK: BIRD SQUAWKS
UNK: ENGINE SHUTS OFF
UNK: And there it is.
Beckett : That's the truck.
Beckett : The one that took Rogan. Here.
Castle : Check out the barn.
Beckett : - Looks like we found our kidnappers. - Then we should call the police.
Beckett : - And tell them what? - That they have guns.
Beckett : On their own property, which is their constitutional right.
Beckett : We don't have proof that they have Rogan.
UNK: Yet.
UNK: Yet? What do you mean, "yet"?
Beckett : Come on, Castle. Let's see if that's where they're keeping him.
UNK: SEATBELT CLICKS
Beckett : Do you want to get married tomorrow, or not?
Castle : What if we get caught?
UNK: We tell 'em we're tourists from the city. We got lost.
Castle : Yes. That worked out really well in Deliverance.
Beckett : Okay, let's start with that barn.
Castle : Place looks like the start of an Amish horror film.
UNK: Shh!
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Rogan?
Rogan : Is that you?
UNK: SCREAMING
Castle : I was not expecting that.
UNK: GASPS
UNK: MUFFLED LAUGH
Martha : - Rogan! - ROGAN STAMPING FEET
UNK: MUFFLED Oh, my God.
UNK: LAUGHING
Rogan : Oh, my God! Dude, you should've heard yourself.
UNK: MIMICS SCREAM
UNK: LAUGHING
UNK: Kit Kat, who is this guy?
UNK: Kit Kat?
Beckett : This guy is Richard Castle, my future husband.
Rogan : Really? Well, after his little scream,
Rogan : you may want to, uh, re-check his man parts.
Castle : My man parts are just fine, thank you very much.
Beckett : Could everyone please stop saying "man parts"?
Rogan : So, how did you find me?
Castle : Well, we just followed the trail of disappointment and deception.
UNK: Led us right to ya.
Rogan : Oh, wow. You're engaged to a douche.
Rogan : Here, why don't you untie me so we can get out of here?
UNK: Fine.
CASTLE : You're a douche.
UNK: - GROANS - There.
UNK: EXHALES DEEPLY
UNK: What are you... What are you doing?
Beckett : Freeing up one hand. That's all you need to sign this.
UNK: LAUGHS
UNK: Good one, Kit Kat. That's hilarious.
Beckett : I'm not joking. If you want me to cut you loose, then sign the papers.
Castle : I'll sign the papers when we're out of here.
Beckett : Sign them. Now.
Rogan : What, you don't trust me?
Castle : In fairness, you did blackmail a pastor.
UNK: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.
Rogan : Don't you want to hear my side of it?
Beckett : I don't care about your side.
Beckett : I just want you to sign these papers.
Castle : You know, maybe we should wait to do this till we get somewhere safe.
Rogan : Yes! Listen to Man Parts. Let's get the hell out of here.
Beckett : So you can disappear again, or get kidnapped? No.
UNK: Just sign these papers. Right now. On the dotted line.
Rogan : You don't understand. Those guys are gonna kill me.
Beckett : Over blackmail photos? They're not gonna kill you, Rogan.
Castle : Though, if you think about it, that would solve our problem.
Rogan : Listen, this isn't about the pastor, okay?
Rogan : There were other photos on that stripper's phone.
Rogan : Photos that had something to do with her boyfriend.
Crystal : Jimmy Lutz?
