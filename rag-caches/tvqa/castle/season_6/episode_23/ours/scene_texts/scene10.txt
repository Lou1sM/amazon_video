Beckett : Well, maybe you already do.
UNK: With Tildy? I don't know, man.
Rogan : I screwed that up. You know, I mean, after all this,
Rogan : I didn't even get her money back.
UNK: And she's gonna lose the bar because of me.
Castle : Not necessarily.
Castle : - From Pastor Bob. - What?
UNK: A $25,000 apology for scamming that money from you.
Castle : He says if he never sees you or those photos again, you're even.

Lanie : People are starting to arrive. Are you ready?
BECKETT : Almost! How did you pull this off?
