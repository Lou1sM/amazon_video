UNK: I... SIGHS
UNK: You know, I'm sorry. I...
Beckett : You're obviously busy, and I should probably just go.
UNK: Um, but if you could just sign this...
UNK: Oh, yeah. Of course. Look, I would...
Rogan : I would really love to sign this
UNK: dissolution-of-marriage agreement for you.
UNK: Great.
UNK: But you're gonna have to do something for me first.
Alexis : Okay. Which one?
UNK: - The easy one. Which is this one. - LAUGHS
UNK: Thank you. Any news from Beckett?
UNK: Uh, she texted me a couple of hours ago,
Castle : said she found him, but I haven't heard from her since.
Esposito : Maybe they're catching up.
Castle : Sure. No, sure, they got a lot in common.
Castle : She can talk about all the people she's put in prison,
Castle : and he can talk about all the people he's met in prison.
UNK: Um, Alexis? I haven't gained this much daddy weight.
Alexis : That can't be right. I double-checked the size 10 times.
Esposito : Maybe you finally hit that growth spurt you've been waiting on.
UNK: - CELLPHONE RINGS - LAUGHS Oh.
Castle : - And that's her. - CELLPHONE BEEPS
Castle : Hey, what's up?
Beckett : Okay, so there has been a little glitch.
Castle : - He won't sign? - Oh, no, he'll sign.
Beckett : But he wants me to do something first.
Castle : What kind of thing?
Beckett : He wants me to break into his ex-girlfriend's truck
Beckett : and steal a garage door opener.
UNK: Okay. Why?
Beckett : Apparently, after they broke up,
Beckett : his ex-girlfriend took a few of his things, and he wants 'em back.
Castle : And he needs the garage door opener to get into her place?
Beckett : Her mom's place, but, yeah.
UNK: But given his record, why doesn't he just steal it himself?
Beckett : Because her truck is parked right outside of her bar,
Beckett : and he can't get close to it
UNK: without someone spotting him and then telling her.
Castle : And you're actually thinking about doing this?
Beckett : If I don't, he won't sign.
Beckett : Castle, he could drag this on for years.
Castle : And if you get caught?
Beckett : I won't. Look, Castle, he's got me over a barrel here.
Beckett : If I don't do this, we don't get married.
Castle : Just get this over with and come home.
Beckett : - I'll call you when I'm done. - CELLPHONE BEEPS

BECKETT : Yes. And I wasn't caught.
Castle : And you're sure he'll sign the papers now?
UNK: Oh, he's gonna sign them, all right.
Beckett : I'm not taking no for an answer.
Beckett : Tell everyone that this wedding is on.
Beckett : I'll be on my way back to the city soon.
Castle : - Can't wait. - Bye.

UNK: - MAN : Go! - Stop!
UNK: Really?
Deputy : Did you get the license of the truck?
Beckett : It didn't have one. But both of the men were wearing masks.
UNK: And your friend who got taken, what's his name?
Beckett : Rogan. Rogan O'Leary.
UNK: SIGHS
Beckett : What? Why are you closing your notebook?
UNK: Ma'am, our department doesn't have the resources to investigate
Deputy : every claim involving Mr. O'Leary.
Beckett : But someone took him.
Deputy : I'm sure they did. I'm sure they had a very good reason.
Deputy : And in a few days, he'll show up drunk, bruised and sorry as hell.
Beckett : I don't have a few days. I need to find him now.
Deputy : Ma'am? From one woman to another, let him go.
UNK: He's been abducted? How? But you...
Beckett : I know. I don't believe it either.
Castle : Okay, okay. I hate to ask, but do you think maybe we should postpone?
Beckett : No! No, I'm not giving up. I'm gonna find him.
Beckett : - How? - Well, I'm a detective.
Beckett : Someone here has to know something.
Castle : You shouldn't be doing this alone. I'm coming up there.
Beckett : Are you sure?
Castle : Yes! Absolutely. Everything here is completely under control.
UNK: I will see you in a few hours. Bye.
Castle : SIGHS Okay.
UNK: CELLPHONE BEEPS
UNK: CELLPHONE RINGS
UNK: Hello. Yes, this is Richard Castle.
UNK: What?
ALEXIS : We lost our venue?
UNK: How is that even possible?
Castle : They had a circus party there tonight, with some first-time fire-breathers.
UNK: And now our rooftop venue does not have a floor.
Alexis : This is a disaster.
Castle : I have no place to get married and no one to get married to.
UNK: I think "disaster" is an understatement.
UNK: So-called "disaster" is merely opportunity in disguise.
Martha : We'll just find another place to hold the wedding.
Castle : Are you kidding? Where are we gonna find a venue in Manhattan
