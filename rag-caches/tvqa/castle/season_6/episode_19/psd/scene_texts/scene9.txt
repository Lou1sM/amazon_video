Burman : A business deal.
Castle : You looked pretty worked up for a business deal.
Burman : There was a lot riding on it.
Beckett : What was the deal?
Burman : Client confidentiality, Detective. I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
Castle : You had a meeting with Peter before that.
Castle : What were you speaking about then?
Burman : Other financial matters.
Castle : What kind of financial matters?
Burman : Sensitive ones.
Burman : Any discussion of which,
Burman : even with law enforcement, would be considered insider trading.
Burman : So, unless you have a subpoena...
Beckett : Who else was at the meeting?
Burman : Just the two of us.
Beckett : And what did you do after you left the lobby?
UNK: Well, we walked up Lafayette and parted ways around Spring.
BECKETT : What time was that?
UNK: Around 6 : 15.
UNK: And where were you between 8 : 00 and 10 : 00?
Burman : At my usual table at Le Cirque.
Burman : Feel free to check.
Neal : It's time.
Burman : Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a conference call with the Fed.
Burman : Oh, and if you want to talk to me again, Detective, call my lawyer.
UNK: Le Cirque confirms that Berman was there from 8 : 00 p.m. Till 10 : 25.
UNK: It couldn't have been him.
UNK: Because a guy like Berman isn't going to get his hands dirty.
UNK: He's gonna hire someone.
Castle : Your sister's right. Berman is behind this.
Castle : - Speaking of your sister... - Let's not.
UNK: If Berman is behind this, he will do everything he can to protect himself.
BECKETT : Knowing that the feds are watching him,
Beckett : he would be careful to cover his tracks.
Beckett : It's going to be next to impossible to trace this back to him.
Castle : So, all we're really sure of is that the sketch he gave us
Castle : is a load of fictitious crap meant to send us in the wrong direction.
