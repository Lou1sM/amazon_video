UNK: Richard Castle : What if we got married on the Cyclone?
UNK: The roller coaster at Coney Island?
Castle : Come on, how much fun would that be?
Castle : And talk about an appropriate,
UNK: if not slightly on-the-nose metaphor.
Castle : A bride and groom together,
UNK: side-by-side, as they go through the ups and downs, the twists and turns
UNK: and the loop-DE-loops of life.
Beckett : Castle, I love you,
Beckett : but I will not marry you on a ride, or up in space, or on a slide.
Castle : I bet Dr. Seuss got married somewhere fun.
Beckett : Yes, his wife's living room.
Beckett : How many people do you think can fit
Beckett : in one of those roller coaster cars anyway?
Beckett : Twenty? Thirty?
Castle : That's a good point.
Castle : We should determine exactly whom we are going to invite.
Beckett : Yeah. Good idea.
