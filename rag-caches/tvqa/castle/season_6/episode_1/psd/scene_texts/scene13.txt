UNK: Uh, this guy, was he military?
UNK: Why, is "Valkyrie" a military term?
Esposito : I don't know about Valkyrie. But Dreamworld?
Esposito : It's a highly classified special operations base in the Gulf.
Esposito : It's a ghost base.
Esposito : The government's never confirmed its existence.
UNK: But I met a guy who knew a guy who was stationed there.
Castle : Where is it?
Esposito : It's a ghost base, Castle. You think he's gonna say where it is?
Esposito : No. But I will tell you this,
Esposito : if Beckett's case has anything to do with this base,
Esposito : well, then she's into something way bigger than she realizes.
