Castle : I don't know. Maybe it's part of the set-up.
Villante : - What's Valkyrie? - "Valkyrie"?
Mccord : What did Jack tell you about Valkyrie?
Jeanette : Look, where is Jack? Do you know where he is?
Castle : Oh, no.
McCORD : She had the encryption system,
Mccord : she had the overseas contacts,
Mccord : and yet, after everything she did,
UNK: she really expects us to believe she wasn't involved.
Beckett : Well, people do crazy things when they're in love.
Mccord : I noticed.
Mccord : Don't tell me you believe her.
Beckett : Well, she's right. Bronson was being set up.
Mccord : And why do you think that?
Beckett : The tools in his apartment,
Beckett : the security footage from the golf course,
Beckett : even the encryption system in his locker.
