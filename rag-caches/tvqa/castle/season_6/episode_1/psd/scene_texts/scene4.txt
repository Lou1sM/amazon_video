UNK: Kevin Ryan : Only four months away. I wanna be ready.
UNK: It's gonna be a long four months.
UNK: TELEPHONE RINGING
UNK: Esposito.
Castle : Sito! It's me.
Esposito : Castle? I'll put you on speaker.
UNK: So where you been, bro? You've missed, like, three Halo nights.
Castle : I told you, I was on a book tour.
UNK: Yeah? Did you tell your book groupies you're engaged now?
Castle : You're swaddling that doll right now, aren't you?
Esposito : So listen, we just finished a case. Come have a drink with us after work.
Castle : I'd love to, but I'm working on a case of my own right now.
Castle : For my next book.
