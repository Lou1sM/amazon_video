UNK: We both deserve more.
UNK: Whatever you decide,
UNK: Katherine Houghton Beckett,
UNK: will you marry me?
Beckett : Oh, my God. Oh, my God! You're proposing!
Castle : Okay. You're surprised.
Beckett : Of course I'm surprised! I thought you were breaking up with me!
Castle : By offering you a ring?
Beckett : Well, you just... You seemed so serious!
Castle : Yeah, of course I'm serious.
Castle : This is the most serious thing I've ever done.
UNK: God!
Castle : So that's a yes?
Beckett : - No, wait. - No?
UNK: - No, no, no! Not "no." - So yes?
Beckett : - I... - Not yes?
UNK: No, not "not yes." I... STAMMERS
Castle : You do know how this works, right?
Beckett : There's something that I have to tell you.
Beckett : I got the job.
Castle : In DC?
Beckett : Castle, I love you,
Beckett : but this is my shot.
Beckett : And if I don't do this, I'll always regret it.
