Beckett : Look, if this changes anything for you, if this changes the way that you feel...
Castle : Kate, I'm not proposing to you to keep you here.
Castle : Or because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you.
Castle : I'm proposing because I can't imagine my life without you.
Castle : If that means when things get difficult, we have to figure them out,
Castle : then I'm willing to figure them out,
Castle : assuming you're willing to figure them out with me.
