UNK: And I have salmon here that needs to be refrigerated.
Beckett : Okay, okay.
UNK: Hey, this is a late-'90s gold sedan. You're the guy...
Castle : Okay, look.
Castle : You're making a mistake here, okay? I don't know...
UNK: That's a red, that's a red...
UNK: Hey, car, car, car, car!
Castle : I don't know who you think I am...
Bronson : I know who you are.
Bronson : You were at the golf course with the Feds.
Bronson : What do they know?
UNK: STAMMERS I'm not sure.
Bronson : Are they looking at me? Do they know about Valkyrie?
Castle : I don't know, I don't know, all right? I swear!
Castle : I wasn't even supposed to be there.
UNK: STRAINING Did they say anything about Valkyrie?
UNK: SCREAMING IN PAIN
Castle : Hey, man, are you okay?
UNK: GRUNTING Can't hold on.
UNK: Going to Dreamworld.
Hendricks : - Hey! - CAR TIRES SQUEALING

UNK: SCREAMING
UNK: SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE
Richmond : - Bronson? - That's him.
Beckett : What about the hardware module?
Hendricks : It's not in the car.
Mccord : - Anybody riding with him? - Yep.
Beckett : - Girlfriend? - Nope. That guy.
Mccord : You've got to be kidding me.
Beckett : You know what? I'll deal with him.
Mccord : No, you've already had your chance.
UNK: Hendricks, please place Mr. Castle under arrest.
Castle : Hello? Is anyone even there?
Castle : Where's Beckett? Let me talk to her.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
Villante : I'm afraid she can't help you.
Castle : This has just been a misunderstanding.
Villante : You were in a car with a man
Villante : who we believe is an enemy combatant of the United States.
Villante : That's not a misunderstanding, Mr. Castle.
Villante : That's a federal offense.
Castle : Whoa! I was abducted at gunpoint.
Villante : Is that so?
Villante : And of all the people in the world,
Villante : why would our chief suspect abduct you?
Castle : I don't know.
Castle : He said he saw me at the golf course with Beckett and McCord.
Villante : Why exactly were you at the golf course?
Villante : Why are you in DC, Mr. Castle?
UNK: I'm here to see my fiancÃ©e.
Villante : But why did you choose to see her on this particular weekend?
Beckett : Well, I...
Castle : Now, wait a minute.
UNK: Wait, you don't think I'm involved in this, do you?
Castle : Okay, look, a man walked up to me on the street,
Castle : shoved a gun in my ribs and forced me into a car.
Castle : Then he started questioning me.
Castle : Whether or not you guys know about him, or about Valkyrie.
Bronson : - Valkyrie? - Yeah.
Villante : What's Valkyrie?
Castle : I don't know! I told him I didn't know!
Castle : And then he dropped dead. Right in the car!
UNK: Mysteriously. With you sitting right next to him.
McCORD : Nope. There's nothing relevant
UNK: about "Valkyrie" in any of our databases.
