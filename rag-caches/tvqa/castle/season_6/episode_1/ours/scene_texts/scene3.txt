Castle : Please tell me your flight is not delayed.
Castle : I don't think I can bear another minute not seeing you.
UNK: I'm sorry, I'm not at the airport.
Castle : You're not coming, are you?
Beckett : I just got put on a priority case.
Castle : Kate, we haven't seen each other in six weeks.
Beckett : Trust me, this was not my call.
Beckett : I'm just as upset as you are.
Castle : No, I know. I'm the one who canceled last time.
Mccord : Beckett! Let's go!
UNK: SIGHS I gotta go. I will make this up to you. I promise.
UNK: Right. I'm gonna hold you to that.
Beckett : Okay, I love you.
UNK: - Love you, too. Bye. - Bye.
Castle : What are you smiling about?
Castle : Oh, can you at least finish taking that off before you shoot me?
Beckett : Castle! Uh!
Beckett : What are you doing here?
Castle : I know I promised to respect your job,
Castle : but I couldn't go another week without seeing you.
Beckett : You shouldn't have come here.
Castle : - So you want me to leave? - Oh, immediately.
BOTH : Mmm.
Beckett : Oh, God!
Castle : Hey, how long have you been up?
UNK: Hey. Couple of hours. Had some homework to do.
Castle : Maybe we should do some homework, too.
UNK: KISSING
Beckett : Yeah, I would love to, except I'm still proving myself.
Beckett : I've gotta know these reports better than the people that wrote them.
UNK: - Is this your case? - Yeah.
Castle : What's it about?
UNK: Castle. It's classified.
Castle : You do realize that only makes me more curious.
Castle : So, is it big?
Beckett : You know I can't talk about it.
Castle : Doesn't mean I can't guess.
UNK: It must be big, you had to cancel our weekend together.
Castle : It must be local, because you're still here.
Castle : I bet I can figure this out.
Beckett : That doesn't mean that you should.
Castle : Come on, don't you miss working together?
Beckett : Yes, I do.
Castle : So, if I were to help you,
Castle : maybe we could solve whatever this is faster
UNK: and have the whole weekend to ourselves.
Castle : Wouldn't you like that?
Beckett : I would.
Beckett : Until I got arrested for disclosing classified information.
UNK: - Come on. Who's gonna know? - KNOCKING ON DOOR
Castle : Wow. They're good.
UNK: I've gotta go. That's my partner.
Beckett : - Oh. - Sorry. No, no. I got it, I got it.
Castle : I'm not looking.
Castle : So what time will you be back?
Beckett : You know what? I'm not quite sure.
Beckett : - I'll give you a call as soon as I find out. - KNOCKING ON DOOR
Beckett : Hey, come on in.
Mccord : Hey, are you ready?
UNK: Yeah. I just gotta get my bag.
