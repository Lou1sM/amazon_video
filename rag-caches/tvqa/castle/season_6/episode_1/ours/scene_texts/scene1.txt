Beckett : And if I don't do this, I'll always regret it.
Beckett : Look, if this changes anything for you, if this changes the way that you feel...

Castle : Or because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you.
Castle : I'm proposing because I can't imagine my life without you.
Castle : If that means when things get difficult, we have to figure them out,
Castle : then I'm willing to figure them out,
