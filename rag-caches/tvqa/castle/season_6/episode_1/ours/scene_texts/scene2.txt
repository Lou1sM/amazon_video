Mccord : the Chechens now have our nuclear launch codes.
Mccord : - Nice job. - CHECHENS APPLAUDING
Beckett : Damn it.
McCORD : You didn't find it odd that the hostage wasn't struggling?
Beckett : She had a gun held to her head.
UNK: But she didn't cry out for help. Why?
UNK: Because she didn't wanna give away her accent. Fine.
Beckett : But the intel said that the operative worked alone.
Mccord : And that's the point of the exercise.
Mccord : Intel is sometimes wrong.
Mccord : You have to use your judgment, your instinct.
Mccord : Because the analyst that's gathering that intel,
Mccord : he's not the one that's gonna be catching a bullet.
UNK: That's gonna be you, or worse, me. Now step up your game.
UNK: McCord!
UNK: HENDRICKS WHISTLES
UNK: Hostage Alley?
Castle : - Yeah. - CHUCKLES
Hendricks : Don't feel bad. Everyone screws that up.
UNK: I should've seen it.
Hendricks : Hey, look, it's better to die in training than in the field, right?
Beckett : It's better not to die at all.
UNK: Yeah. CHUCKLES
UNK: Listen, a few of us are grabbing a beer tonight.
UNK: You wanna join?
UNK: Thank you, Hendricks, I would love to,
Beckett : but with the caseload and the training,
Beckett : I haven't had a weekend off in ages and I've actually got plans.
Mccord : Not anymore.
UNK: We just received a Priority Seven from the AG.
Villante : There's been an incident. A potential national security breach.
Martha : Ah, the prodigal son returns. How was the West Coast book tour?
Castle : It was exhausting.
UNK: Twelve cities in 11 days. I signed my fingers to the bone.
Martha : - Poor boy. - Mmm. Mwah!
UNK: I'm gonna go change. I'll let this guy fill you in on all the details.
Castle : He's best with rhetorical questions.
Castle : - Is Alexis back? - Oh, yeah.
Martha : She came in this morning.
Castle : I thought she was in Costa Rica until...
Martha : Next week. Surprise!
Alexis : Daddy? Hi!
UNK: Mmm, come here, you.
Castle : How was your trip?
UNK: Oh! Amazing. Just wait till you see our pictures.
UNK: "Our" pictures?
MAN : Hey, Al? Where do you keep the matches?
UNK: I wanna light these sage bundles.
Martha : Surprise, again.
Alexis : Dad, Pi. Pi, Dad.
Pi : Hey Mr. C.
Pi : Awesome to meet you.
UNK: "Pie." Like the dessert?
UNK: Without the E. Like the Greek letter.
Pi : But, personally, I feel the whole spelling thing just stifles creativity.
UNK: The "spelling thing"?
Alexis : Let's let my dad decompress. Matches are in the kitchen.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : He's not staying here?
Martha : Oh, he is.
UNK: HUMMING
Castle : Not in her room?
Martha : You get to have that talk. I have a class. Ta-ta.
UNK: Uh, Alexis, could I talk to you a second?
Alexis : Give him a chance, Dad. I really like him, and he's brilliant.
UNK: POTS CLANGING
UNK: Found 'em!
Castle : - We'll talk about this later. - Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Uh, make sure you put some blankets out on the couch
Castle : for Pi if he's staying.
UNK: - I want him to be comfortable. - CELL PHONE RINGING
Castle : And visible.
