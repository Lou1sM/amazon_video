CASTLE : I told you there were two ninjas.
BECKETT : Castle! Get the gun!
Castle : Which one do I shoot?
Beckett : Drop the dagger! Now!
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
UNK: Bedford?
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
Beckett : Saya, drop it.
Saya : All this time,
Saya : my sister was using you to get to the Green Dragon.
Saya : But it was you all along.
CASTLE : It's the perfect ninja disguise.
Castle : A white American working as a Yakuza enforcer.
Castle : He's hiding in plain sight.
Saya : You killed my family.
Beckett : Saya, drop it.
Saya : He took everything!
Beckett : I know. I've been there.
Beckett : You want blood for blood, but it's not worth it.
Beckett : Just let him live with who he really is.
UNK: METAL CLANGS
Castle : And you're afraid we're gonna become boring?
Gates : I contacted my colleagues at the US and Japanese embassies, Miss Ozu.
Gates : They have decided not to press charges on impersonating a Consulate official.
UNK: SIGHS I appreciate that, Captain.
Gates : And I'd like to offer my personal condolences on the loss of your sister.
Saya : Thank you, Detective, for helping bring my family's killer to justice.
Beckett : Well, thank you for protecting the people that I care about.
UNK: Oh, there's something that we have to give you.
Beckett : Here you go. It's not evidence anymore.
Saya : My sister had this made in Okinawa.
Saya : It is a replica of the one that was used to kill my parents.
Castle : So, the place we found it, I'm guessing that wasn't the killer's lair.
Saya : No, that was my sister's shrine.
Saya : I took this from you because I thought I would need it to avenge Jade.
UNK: Well, I guess ninjas really do exist.
Saya : No, I was not lying about that.
Saya : There are no more ninjas, Mr. Castle.
Saya : I am merely a practitioner of the martial arts.
Saya : But I'm very, very good.
UNK: First Ninja : I'll say.
UNK: WHISPERS That's gotta be...
GATES : Ow!
UNK: Sidney Perlmutter : Mr. Castle!
Castle : Not boring.
UNK: No. No, not at all.
