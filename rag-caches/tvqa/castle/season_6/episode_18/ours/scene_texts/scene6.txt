Castle : Jade had a dream job and a wealthy boyfriend.
Castle : Why would she be working at a Japanese hostess club?
Lee : I don't know.
Esposito : But if this place had anything to do with her death,
UNK: no one's gonna talk to us if they so much as smell a badge.
Castle : Well, then, tonight we are not cops.
UNK: We are just upscale gentlemen looking for a good time.
UNK: And if we play our cards right,
Castle : we'll pick up some information along the way.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: Hello.
UNK: Konnichiwa, and welcome to Miyago.
UNK: Mama-san : - May I offer you a table? - Your very best.
UNK: THANKING IN JAPANESE
UNK: Mama-san : Table seven.
ESPOSITO : Take that for me. Perfect.
UNK: All right. Oh.
Yumi : So, is this your first time at Miyago?
Beckett : - Yes. - No. Um...
UNK: Well, he and I have been here before, but...
Ryan : - I'm married. - That's okay. Most of the guys here are.
UNK: CHUCKLES Yeah, but I'm really married. Eh.
ESPOSITO : Oh, here we go. Yeah!
UNK: SIGHS
Esposito : Here you are.
UNK: Oh. LAUGHS NERVOUSLY
Beckett : Here you go. It's nicer over there.
Castle : You know, the last time we were here, there was that one girl...
UNK: Um, with the short haircut, like from Pulp Fiction.
Beckett : You mean Jade?
Esposito : Jade! Yes, Jade!
Esposito : So, have you girls seen her around lately?
UNK: Um, well, see, what my friend isn't telling you
UNK: is that he actually had a little crush on Jade.
UNK: - Hmm. Aw. - It was just... Come on.
UNK: Well, I'll make you forget all about her.
UNK: You wanna buy some private time?
Castle : No, thanks. I'm fine right here.
Kiara : I don't think you are, not if you're asking about Jade.
UNK: Are you sure you don't wanna buy some private time?
Castle : Yes, I do want to buy some private time.
ESPOSITO : What?
UNK: Um, hey, Castle, where you going?
UNK: Uh, just gonna go do what we came here for.
Castle : You guys cover me, entertain these beautiful ladies.
Esposito : What's he doing?
UNK: - SINGING - LAUGHTER
UNK: Kate Beckett : Oh, um...
Castle : Wait a minute. I'm flattered, but I really...
UNK: Play the part, or we'll get in trouble.
Castle : Right, right. Okay.
Kiara : Why are you asking about Jade? You're not one of her customers.
UNK: No. No, I'm a friend.
Kiara : Is she okay?
UNK: Um...
Kiara : She's dead.
Kiara : I knew it.
Kiara : I knew when she didn't come in tonight.
Kiara : They got to her.
UNK: Who?
UNK: Hey! Who got to her?
Kiara : Look, I tried to warn her, but she wouldn't stop.
Castle : Stop what?
UNK: ALARM RINGING
Castle : I have to call.
UNK: In a minute. She wouldn't stop what?
Ryan : - What the hell is he doing back there? - I don't know.
Esposito : Hey, you know what, ladies?
Esposito : I don't really like this sake.
Esposito : Do you think maybe we could get another bottle
UNK: of something better, more expensive?
UNK: - Mmm. - I like the way you think.
UNK: CHUCKLES Be right back.
ESPOSITO : Right on. I'll be right here.
Esposito : All right, some of these businessmen look a little shady.
Esposito : Look, check it out. I see tattoos, scars.
Esposito : Why don't you take a lap around and see if anyone looks familiar?
Esposito : I'll stay here and entertain the ladies.
Castle : All right.
Aiko : Yeah, let's do karaoke. It'll be fun.
UNK: Oh, no, no. It will be? Okay. Really?
UNK: MOUTHING What you doing?
