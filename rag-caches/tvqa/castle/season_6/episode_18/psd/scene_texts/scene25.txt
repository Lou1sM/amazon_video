UNK: but a man like Saito is careful.
Beckett : We need someone to talk.
Beckett : We need to find someone who was actually at the party that night.
UNK: Hey, we got a problem.
Ryan : I just tried to contact that Consulate officer, Amaya Tagami,
UNK: see if there's any connection between Jade's family and Michio Saito.
UNK: According to the Consulate,
UNK: Ms. Tagami's been on maternity leave for two months.
UNK: So the woman who showed up here...
Ryan : Was an imposter.
BECKETT : Who is this woman?
Beckett : And why would she impersonate a Consulate officer?
Castle : Maybe she's working for Saito.
UNK: If he is Yakuza, he'd have all kinds of assets working for him.
