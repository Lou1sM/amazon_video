Lee : - Deal? - Okay, deal.
Castle : Does this mean you forgive me for not calling?
UNK: Mmm-mmm. Not yet.
UNK: Well...
Castle : How about now?
UNK: Hmm, getting there.
Castle : This is torture.
UNK: - Are those cronuts? - RYAN : Yeah, have one.
UNK: Richard Castle : - Hey! - They're not both for me.
Ryan : Yeah, sure they're not. Where's Castle this morning, anyway?
Beckett : He's writing down everything he can remember about the ninja fight
UNK: and hopes to use it for his next book.
UNK: So, who went down to SoHo to get cronuts?
UNK: We did. Turns out that this bakery delivered a 40th birthday cake
Ryan : to our suspect and financier Michio Saito
