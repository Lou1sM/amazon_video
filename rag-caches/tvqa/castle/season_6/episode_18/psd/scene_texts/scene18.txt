Kiara : It's like she was targeting him.
Castle : And this client, what's his name?
Kiara : We only know him as Mr. Saito.
Kiara : But he must be important, because lots of people are scared of him.
Castle : So he was here last night and she was with him?
UNK: No.
Kiara : He has private parties sometimes and hires girls from the club.

Kiara : And last night, she did.
Castle : Where was this party?
Kiara : Upper East Side.

Ryan : Was it that bad?
CASTLE : Why do you think Saito killed her?
Kiara : Something happened at the party last night.
Kiara : One of the girls said Mr. Saito found Jade going through his things.
Kiara : He hit the roof and had his people throw her out.
UNK: Do you have any idea which of his things she was going through?
UNK: GRUNTING
Epsosito : Pushing me... Man.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: - $6,000? - Ow.
UNK: $6,000? Really?
