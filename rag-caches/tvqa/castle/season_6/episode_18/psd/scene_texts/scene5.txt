Beckett : sitting on the building on the off chance that he returns.
UNK: KNOCKING ON DOOR
Ryan : Excuse me, sir.
Ryan : Detective Beckett, this is Consulate Officer Amaya Tagami.
UNK: Amaya Tagamai : I came as soon as I could.
UNK: Jade Yamata's death is a terrible loss, and the Ambassador has asked me
Amaya : to keep him informed of your progress on this case.
Amaya : I spoke to Jade's parents in Kyoto, and they, too, are anxious for news.
Beckett : All we know is that the attacker may have a connection to Japan.
Beckett : Now, did Jade's parents say if she had any enemies?
Amaya : No. The truth is, they hadn't spoken to her in weeks.
