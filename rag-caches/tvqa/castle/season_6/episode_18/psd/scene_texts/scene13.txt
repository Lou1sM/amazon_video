RYAN : What is this place, a geisha house?
Castle : No. It is a Japanese hostess bar, the modern-day equivalent.
Castle : I've been to a few of these in Tokyo on a book tour.
Esposito : I bet you have.
UNK: It's all a perfectly acceptable part of doing business in the Japanese culture.
Ryan : And the girls?
UNK: Uh, they work for the club. They flirt, they get you to buy drinks.
Castle : Just keep things generally fun.
Ryan : No, no, no. The dresses that they're wearing...
Ryan : The same ones that Jade had on when she was killed.
UNK: She must've been working here that night.
Castle : Most of these girls are doing it for the money.
Castle : Jade had a dream job and a wealthy boyfriend.
Castle : Why would she be working at a Japanese hostess club?
Lee : I don't know.
