UNK: Saya Ozu : This is not what you think, Detective Beckett.
Beckett : Yeah, that's what all guilty people say.
UNK: Is this a badge?
Castle : You're a cop?
Saya : Not just a cop.
Saya : I'm Jade's sister.
Saya : My sister and I hid when the Green Dragon came.
UNK: We barely got a glimpse of him. He was dressed in black, face covered.
UNK: But we heard our parents screaming and begging for their lives.
UNK: SIGHS
Saya : After the explosion, my uncle, a policeman,
Saya : he found us and he got us to safety.
Saya : He falsified the report to say that we were killed,
UNK: so the Yakuza would not look for us.
Beckett : So then you both survived.
Saya : Until now.
Beckett : What were you doing in that building?
UNK: I knew you'd have gone there in connection with the case.
Saya : I wanted to make sure you didn't miss anything.
Beckett : Why didn't you just tell us who you were from the start?
Beckett : Why this whole masquerade?
Saya : If the Green Dragon knew who I was, he'd kill me.
Saya : I tried to put what happened to my family behind me, but Jade,
Saya : she could not let it go.
Saya : She made it her mission to find out who he was.
Saya : It's why she came to New York.
Saya : Three days ago, she called me and said she was closing in on someone.
Beckett : - Did she say who? - No.
Saya : She said she needed to get proof first.
Saya : I flew out to try and stop her, but by the time I got here...
UNK: How'd she know that the Green Dragon was in the United States?
