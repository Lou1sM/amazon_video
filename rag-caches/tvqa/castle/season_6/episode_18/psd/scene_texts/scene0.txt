CASTLE : Hey, you wanna go to Lincoln Center
UNK: Richard Castle : and hear some jazz tonight?
UNK: Wynton Marsalis is playing.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Oh, I would love to, but I can't.
UNK: Kate Beckett : I've got that dinner with my old friend from high school.
Castle : You don't sound very thrilled about going.
UNK: Yeah, you know, it's just Carly's always been really competitive,
Beckett : talking about her fabulous life nonstop.
Castle : I bet no one's basing a character in their best-selling mysteries on her.
Beckett : True. But the last time I talked to her,
Beckett : she just came back from the French Riviera
Beckett : with a count that she met in Monaco.
Beckett : And now I hear she's married to some big-shot European businessman
Beckett : that she met on a yoga retreat, and she's embraced the spiritual life.
Castle : Well, you want me to tag along
Castle : and regale her with tales of our crime-solving adventures?
Beckett : Definitely not. You are exactly her type.
