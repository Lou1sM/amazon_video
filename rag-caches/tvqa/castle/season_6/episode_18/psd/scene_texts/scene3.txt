Castle : This place is seriously creepy for a cookie factory.
Castle : Maybe the killer lured Jade here and she escaped,
Castle : but she was unable to outrun the flying dagger of doom.
Beckett : That doesn't make any sense, Castle.
Castle : How so?
Beckett : Because! Look at this place. It's filthy.
Beckett : There's no way Jade would set foot in here.
Beckett : Not with the clothes that she was wearing.
Castle : Here's something else that doesn't make sense.
Castle : There's no electricity. Why would the killer have a key to an elevator
Castle : - if there's no power to make it work? - Let's go find out.
Beckett : There's another room back here.
