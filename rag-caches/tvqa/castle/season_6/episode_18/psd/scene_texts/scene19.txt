Castle : I wouldn't say that.
Ryan : You mean, besides lipstick marks on your shirt.
Castle : I actually got a lead in there that's gonna blow this case wide...
UNK: Oh, oh, wait. Lipstick marks? On my shirt? Where? Beckett'll kill me.
Castle : Oh, my God! I didn't call! You guys, Beckett is going to kill me.
Castle : Ninja attack.
UNK: Aah!
RYAN : Castle, look out!
Esposito : Don't move!
Kiara : Stay away.
UNK: First Ninja : Next time, you die.
Ryan : Let me see your hands!
UNK: - Where did he go? - I don't know. He was just...
Esposito : You had him.
Gates : Now there are two ninjas?
Esposito : Captain, I know it sounds crazy...
Gates : You bet it sounds crazy.
Gates : One attacks you, the other saves your life? It makes no sense.
Castle : Unless they are rivals in an ancient feud.
Castle : Two warring clans, one committed to the path of darkness,
Castle : the other sworn to follow the path of light.
Gates : This is not a ninja movie, Mr. Castle. This is a murder investigation.
Lee : I don't know where those ninjas came from, sir,
Esposito : but what I do know is that our victim was trying to get close to Mr. Saito.
Esposito : And when she did, she was killed by a knife thrown expertly into her chest.
