UNK: Now, the guy that attacked us tonight has the skills to throw that knife.
Gates : What do we know about this Saito?
Castle : Not much. No first name.
Castle : His reputation at the club is that he's dangerous.
Esposito : And given the fond farewell that we received,
Esposito : I'm guessing that the club is not gonna share
Esposito : their client and employee records without a warrant.
Gates : I thought this party was on the Upper East Side.
Gates : Have you looked for an address?
UNK: Uh, yeah, but the name Saito's like "Smith" in Japan.
Ryan : There's literally dozens of them up there.
Ryan : Without any information, it's gonna be very hard to find him.
Castle : Maybe not.
UNK: Sidney Perlmutter : Mr. Castle?
Castle : We know he threw a party last night.
Castle : A guy like Saito, he's gonna have it catered.
Ryan : We find that party, we find Saito.
