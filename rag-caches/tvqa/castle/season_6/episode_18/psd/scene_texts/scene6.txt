Amaya : Her moving here caused a bit of a rift.
Castle : Why did she move?
Castle : Was she trying to get away from someone? Or something?
Amaya : I don't think so. They told me she came here for her ballet career.
Beckett : How would I go about talking to them?
Amaya : I'm afraid they don't speak English,
Amaya : but I'm happy to pass along any questions you have.
Beckett : Yeah, thanks, I might take you up on that.
Beckett : But in the meantime, could you tell us what this means?
UNK: This kanji is Izanami, the Shinto goddess of creation and death.
Castle : Now, could it have any sinister connotations?
Castle : Might it be found in the lair of, say, a ninja?
Beckett : No. Uh...
Amaya : This is, uh, very common.
