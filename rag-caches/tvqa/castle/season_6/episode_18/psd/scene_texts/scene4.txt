Castle : This must be his lair.
Beckett : Yeah, and that's some kind of a shrine.
Castle : A shrine to murder.
Castle : Check this out.
Castle : Design of this hilt matches the bruises we saw.
Castle : And I'm betting there's traces of blood on here, too.
UNK: CLANGING
Beckett : Someone's here.
UNK: MOUTHING Wait.
UNK: GRUNTING
CASTLE : Beckett!
Beckett : - Castle, what happened? - Uh...
UNK: A ninja stole the murder weapon.
UNK: CHUCKLES
UNK: Yeah!
UNK: Victoria Gates : You were attacked by a ninja? And you witnessed it?
Beckett : Uh, no, sir, not exactly.
Castle : Because he made a sound and drew her away.
Castle : Ninjas are masters of the surprise attack.
Beckett : In any case, we think that he's our killer because the knife that he took
Beckett : from Castle appears to be our murder weapon.
Gates : So what you're saying is that...
Castle : Our killer is a ninja.
Beckett : Or he is just an athletic person with a hooded tracksuit.
UNK: Yeah, who disappeared in a puff of smoke.
Beckett : Yes, which I could do if I had a smoke bomb.
Gates : Whatever the man is,
Gates : do you have any sense as to why he would kill Jade Yamata?
BECKETT : No, sir, we don't have motive yet,
Beckett : but we're looking into the objects on the shrine
Beckett : just in case they're connected to our victim.
Gates : Where are we on IDing the suspect?
Beckett : There's no security video, either from the building or the street cams.
Castle : Not that any self-respecting ninja would be caught on video.
Beckett : But CSU is sweeping the place for prints, for evidence.
