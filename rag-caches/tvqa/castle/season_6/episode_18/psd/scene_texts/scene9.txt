Castle : He could be both.
Castle : And being a dancer could just be his cover,

BECKETT : And somehow he lured Jade there for a little private time?
Castle : Right, but she rejected him, fled. He killed her in a jealous rage.

Castle : Look, I'm not claiming to have all the answers, yet.
UNK: But just look at that guy. He's a ninja through and through.
UNK: And I'm gonna prove it.
UNK: How?
