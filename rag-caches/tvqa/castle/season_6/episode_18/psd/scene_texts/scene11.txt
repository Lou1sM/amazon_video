Ryan : It's a tea import company not far from where Jade was killed.
UNK: I asked her boyfriend. He didn't know anything about it. Yes, Castle?
Ryan : Why would Jade be calling a tea import company every night?
Ryan : My guess would be the same reason
UNK: she was using a pay phone instead of her cell.
Ryan : Something shady was going on.
Beckett : We need to check it out. I should cancel my plans.
UNK: Oh, no. Hey, we got this.
UNK: I wouldn't want you to cancel your plans with Carly and the goddess.
UNK: Just make sure you call me at 10 : 00.
UNK: This does not look like a tea import company.
Castle : So what is this place?
Castle : And why would Jade be calling here?
Beckett : Check it out.
ESPOSITO : What's a limo doing in the warehouse district?
UNK: - BUZZER BUZZING - LOCK CLICKS
Castle : This is definitely not a tea import company.
Esposito : - Then let's go. - Yeah.
UNK: Um, hey, guys. You, um, think that's wise?
Castle : We really have no idea what's behind that door. There's only three of us.
Esposito : - And two of us are cops. - Yeah.
Esposito : It's locked.
UNK: BUZZER BUZZING
UNK: Oh.
