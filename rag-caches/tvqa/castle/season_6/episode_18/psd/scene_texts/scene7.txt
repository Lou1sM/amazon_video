Amaya : People use it to honor their ancestors.
Amaya : Where did you find this?
Beckett : In a room where we believe our killer spent time.
Amaya : Well, I can assure you he's not a ninja.
Amaya : There are no such things as ninjas anymore.
CASTLE : What does she know anyway?
UNK: I bet she's never even seen Ninja Ill : The Domination.
Beckett : Yeah. No, I mean, she only comes from the country that created the mythology.
Castle : Which does not make her an expert.
UNK: Our victim was killed ninja-style.
UNK: From a killer who had some kind of mysterious shrine.
Beckett : I swear she just said that it wasn't that mysterious.
RYAN : Yeah, about that shrine...
Ryan : CSU didn't find any prints on it anywhere.
Ryan : Or anywhere else at the lair. Place was wiped.
Castle : Because ninjas never leave a trace. I know what I saw.
UNK: You should've seen the way he moved.
Castle : The athleticism, the grace, the agility. He was like a...
Esposito : - Ballet dancer. - No!
Beckett : Yeah. No, actually, a ballet dancer could move like our alleged ninja did.
ESPOSITO : Only now we got motive.
Esposito : I talked to the dancers who lived with Jade back at the dorms.
Esposito : Apparently, there was some major bad blood
Esposito : between her and a male dancer named Lee Tong.
UNK: SIGHS Man! Our killer can't be a ballet dancer.
Castle : Because it would just be such a huge letdown.
Beckett : Of course. We can't let facts get in the way of a good story.
UNK: What do you mean by "bad blood"?
Esposito : Turns out that Lee had a thing for Jade, but she just didn't feel the same way.
Esposito : Then they both got cast in Madame Butterfly,
Esposito : where they had to play lovers.
Esposito : Rehearsals turned into screaming matches,
UNK: and yesterday, one of the other dancers overheard Lee threatening to kill Jade.
