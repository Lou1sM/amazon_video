Ryan : That's what I've been saying.
Esposito : Yo, this guy checks out.
RYAN : WHISPERS Oh, thank God. My arm.
Beckett : So Anton Renkov was using the movie as a front
Beckett : to smuggle arms into the U.S. For the Russian mob?
Beckett : And Charlie's job was to find those guns?
Wright : More or less.
Wright : He contacted me a couple of days ago.
UNK: He told me that he'd located the shipment.
Wright : We set up a meet so we could get him a GPS tracker to attach to the guns.
Wright : When he didn't call, I started looking for him.
UNK: Would've been nice if you told us sooner.
UNK: What can I say? It was need-to-know.
Wright : We needed you to monitor the investigation,
Wright : so NYPD didn't get too close to the Russians to compromise our operation.
Wright : We also figured you might lead us to the weapons, which you did.
UNK: So what happens how?
Wright : We hope that Renkov sends the guns on to wherever they're going,
Wright : so we can track them.
UNK: And you guys walk away.
RYAN : I can't believe Charlie was spying on Anton Renkov and his organization.
Ryan : Any of them look familiar?
Esposito : Yeah. I saw about three of those Russians on the movie set.
UNK: - RYAN : Mmm-hmm. - And according to Interpol,
Sully : all of them got criminal records back in the motherland.
Sully : Assault, murder, all kinds of bad stuff.
UNK: I bet one of them found out that Charlie was a spy and they killed him.
UNK: Especially since we know that Charlie was followed to the warehouse.
Ryan : Based on what?
