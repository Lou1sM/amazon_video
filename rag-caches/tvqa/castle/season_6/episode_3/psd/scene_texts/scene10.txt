Sully : is some personal appearance trips to Russia over the last few years.
Sully : - Russia? - Oh, yeah.
UNK: 2 Cool for School is huge over there.
Ryan : Dewey is to Russia what David Hasselhoff is to Germany.
UNK: I did catch a break off his credit card.
Sully : I got a line on a cab that picked Charlie up the day he got killed.
UNK: - Where'd it take him? - His sublet. But here's the kicker.
UNK: Another dude hopped in the backseat and the two of them got in a huge fight.
RYAN : Did you get a description?
UNK: Uh, no. Better. I got a name. His former co-star, Ramon Russo.
Ryan : Oh, yeah. He played the jock, Marco, right?
UNK: Richard Castle : - Yeah. - Oh.

UNK: Maybe that feud led to murder.
UNK: Ramon Russo : It was an accident. BREATHING HEAVILY
