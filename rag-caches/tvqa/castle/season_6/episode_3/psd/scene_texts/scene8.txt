Gates : but you're not going to tell us why you're here?
UNK: It's need-to-know.
Mccord : We'll be setting up in the conference room.
Mccord : We'll need any preliminary reports,
UNK: and all of Reynolds' personal electronics, phones, iPads, computers.
Mccord : Thank you for your cooperation.
Mccord : We'll use the victim's phone and computer data
Mccord : to reconstruct what he was up to in his last 24 hours.
Mccord : And by the way, D.C. Made it clear that they want us to send it to them.
Beckett : - Why do they want the data? - TYPING
Mccord : They didn't say. They rarely do.
UNK: SIGHS That's got to bother you.
Mccord : We don't always get the whole picture. Comes with the territory.
CASTLE : Maybe we should go over there
UNK: and just invite them in for some coffee, you know?
Esposito : We are not serving them coffee.
UNK: You bought this espresso machine for the NYPD.
Esposito : This is NYPD coffee only.
Castle : Come on, guys. That's a little harsh.
Ryan : Harsh? Beckett's a Judas.
Ryan : Her and her partner just hijacked our case.
UNK: Whose side are you on?
UNK: Your side. Look, guys, I'm on your side.
Esposito : Hey, Ryan, isn't it a little weird
UNK: that Castle shows up the same day that Agent Beckett takes over?
Ryan : Yes. It's quite a coincidence.
UNK: CHUCKLES No. It's not a... That...
Castle : Yeah, well... No, actually, yes, it's a coincidence.
Esposito : Maybe you and Beckett are in on this together.
Esposito : Maybe you are her inside man. You are Judas' Judas!
