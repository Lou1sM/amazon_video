UNK: No. Guys, no, I swear! Come on, you know me.
UNK: - I'm watching you, Castle. - CELL PHONE CHIMES, BEEPS
Ryan : Perlmutter's got something for us.
Esposito : - Let's go. - Yeah.
UNK: After a complete examination, I was able to narrow time of death
UNK: to between 11 : 30 and 1 : 30.
UNK: And perimortem bruising on the arm and shoulder
UNK: is consistent with signs of a struggle.
Ryan : So Charlie fought back before he was thrown off the roof.
UNK: Yes,
Perlmutter : but the most fascinating discovery resides in here.
Esposito : Which is?
Perlmutter : An unusually large quantity of fresh bird excrement
Perlmutter : that I extracted from the tread of the victim's shoes.
UNK: No. I'll take your word for it.
Esposito : Okay, so he stepped in some pigeon...
Perlmutter : Sure! Only it didn't come from pigeons.
UNK: Now, painstaking analysis proves that this is none other than chicken poop.
Ryan : Not a lot of that in Manhattan.
Castle : Maybe Charlie's mystery job had something to do with chickens?
UNK: Well, after 2 Cool for School, almost anything is a step up.
UNK: Hey, now...
Esposito : What else you got for us?
Perlmutter : I'm afraid that's all I'm authorized to tell you at this time.
UNK: ELEVATOR BELL DINGS
Epsosito : I can't believe it. Even Perlmutter's answering to the feds now.
Ryan : We're being iced out of our own case.
Castle : Guys, maybe there's a perfectly reasonable explanation
Castle : for all the secrecy.
UNK: That's... You guys are right. This is outrageous!
