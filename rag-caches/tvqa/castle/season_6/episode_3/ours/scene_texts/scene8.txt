Esposito : What makes that an irregularity?
Castle : Well, for one thing, it'd be a lot cheaper just to rent cameras here.
Ryan : Not only that, but the shipment was sent to a warehouse in Brooklyn.
Sully : Which happens to be right next to a chicken processing plant.
Castle : Which explains the poop on Charlie's shoes.
UNK: Charlie went to that warehouse right before he was killed.
Esposito : Maybe whoever killed him came from there.
ESPOSITO : Looks deserted.
