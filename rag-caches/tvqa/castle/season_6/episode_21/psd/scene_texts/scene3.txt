Beckett : and you didn't come back until 5 : 00 a.m.
Manny : I hooked up with a girl! She'll tell you I was with her all night.
Beckett : Yeah, I'm sure she will.
Beckett : But that video of you threatening Logan yesterday,
UNK: that's gonna be a lot harder to explain away.
Manny : No. That's not what it looks like.
Castle : Really? Because it looks like it is what it looks like.
Manny : Listen, right before that video was taken,
Manny : I caught Logan ransacking the festival mobile office, all right?
Castle : Ransacking, as in trashing?
Manny : It was more like he was looking for something.
Beckett : Like what?
Manny : I don't know. And he wouldn't explain himself, so I got up in his face!
UNK: That's what was on the video tape.
Castle : You report it?
UNK: I was gonna tell Tom Fulton, the festival's CEO,
Manny : but he begged me not to, so I kept my mouth shut.
Beckett : And why would you do that for him?
Manny : Logan asked me for 24 hours.
Manny : He swore it was a matter of life and death.
Manny : I guess he was right.
MAN : ON SPEAKERS Immediately following the competition,
UNK: stick around for the meet-and-greet.
UNK: Tom Fulton : Can I help you?
Beckett : Yeah, I'm Detective Beckett. This is my associate, Mr. Castle.
Beckett : We're looking for Tommy Fulton.
Manny : That's me.
Fulton : News just broke Logan Moore was killed. I'm sick about it.
