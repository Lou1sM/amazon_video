UNK: You here about that or the break-in?
Beckett : Both, actually. When was the last time you saw Logan?
Fulton : Two days ago. He was here doing some practice runs.
Castle : Did he have any issues with anyone here,
Castle : or trouble with anyone on the circuit?
UNK: Well, the guys play to win, but it stays out in the park, you know?
Beckett : So, what was taken from here?
Fulton : So far, the only thing I know missing for sure is my gun.
UNK: I kept a.45 in my desk. Legally registered.
Beckett : Did Logan know about the gun?
UNK: Wait, you think Logan broke in here?
Castle : I'm assuming that would've been out of character?
Fulton : Hell, yes! He was on his way to becoming the next Tony Hawk.
Beckett : Is there any reason that Logan would've needed a gun?
UNK: Look.
Fulton : I know Logan. He had a tough go of things growing up.
