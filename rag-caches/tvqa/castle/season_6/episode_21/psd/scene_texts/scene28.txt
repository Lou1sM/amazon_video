Castle : when Jay Dixon was killed?
UNK: If you ever tell anyone what happened to Jay, you'll be dead, too!
Beckett : When I asked you earlier this morning about Jay Dixon,
UNK: you said that you never heard of him. And that was a lie.
Zaretsky : That tape proves nothing about Logan or Jay's deaths.
Beckett : I can place you at the scene of a six-year-old unsolved murder.
Beckett : I also have circumstantial evidence that you killed Logan in order to cover it up.
Beckett : Now, how much more do you think a jury is gonna need
Beckett : in order to connect those dots?
Fulton : I can explain.
Zaretsky : Don't explain anything, Tommy.
Beckett : You think you can hide behind attorney-client privilege
UNK: if you concealed evidence of a child's murder?
Beckett : I will have you disbarred!
Beckett : And then you will stand trial alongside your client.
Castle : Maybe you'd like to call your lawyer.
Zaretsky : Don't say another word.
Fulton : Brett, what's the point? I mean, the whole plan is screwed anyway.
UNK: Would you stop digging our graves?
Fulton : I'm not going down for murders that someone else did.
Zaretsky : For God's sake, shut your mouth, Tommy.
Fulton : No. Not this time.
Beckett : I think you should leave now.
UNK: Well, you can't kick me out of here. This man is my client.
Fulton : You're fired.
Beckett : Either you leave on your own or I will have you forcibly removed.
Castle : Tommy, what happened?
Castle : How did Jay die six years ago?
Fulton : I started out making skateboard videos with Jay and Logan.
