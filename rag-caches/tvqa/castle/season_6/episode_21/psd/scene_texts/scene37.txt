Castle : Why did you do that?
Beckett : New game. Poker.
Castle : You want to play poker against me?
Beckett : Strip poker.
Castle : I'll deal.
Castle : Your bet.
UNK: I think I'm gonna go all in.
Castle : Me, too.
Castle : But all I have left to bet with is this shirt.
Beckett : I'll take that bet.
UNK: - What do you got? - Who cares?
Castle : - This is so much better than Scrabble. - Yeah!
