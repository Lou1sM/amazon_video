ESPOSITO : So what happened, bro? The two of you did a job together?
Esposito : And you had a falling out,
Esposito : then you decided you didn't want to share the score?
Carter : Dude, I'm telling you, I didn't kill anyone.
Beckett : Come on, Carter, you had his bag and his ID on you.
Beckett : You were blocks away from where he was killed
Beckett : and you ride a motocross bike.
Beckett : With your criminal record, this is gonna be a slam dunk for the DA.
Carter : No, no, no, I'm telling you.
Carter : The last time I saw Logan that night, he was still alive.
Beckett : So you admit to having seen him.
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Good.
Carter : He heard about my past and hired me for a job.
Beckett : Okay, so what was the job?
Carter : A B and E.
UNK: He told me he'd give me three grand
Carter : to bypass an alarm system and belay him from a rooftop,
Carter : so that he could get into a 15th-floor office.
Esposito : - What office? - I don't know.
Carter : I was on the roof.
UNK: He cut in through the window, went in, and then sent up the gear with the bag.
Carter : That was the last I saw him.
Carter : The plan was for me to disappear with the gear
UNK: and then stash it back at the gym.
UNK: Did he have a camcorder with him?
UNK: Yeah. I mean, there was one in the bag. But it wasn't there when he sent it back.
Esposito : - Did he tell you what he was after? - No.
