Esposito : A top pro who had beef with Logan.
Esposito : Six months ago, Logan showed him up at an event in Los Angeles,
Esposito : then beat him two more times after that.
UNK: Tensions got super high between the two of them.
Beckett : A reigning champion unable to cope with defeat. That sounds familiar.
Esposito : Yeah, but then yesterday, things got physical.
Esposito : A fan posted this on YouTube.
UNK: Hey, I'm talking to you, Logan. You think you can just walk away?
UNK: Get off me, man!
UNK: Your skating days are done. You're done! You hear me, Logan?
Beckett : Where's Manny Castro now?
UNK: He's at the venue. The street-style event just ended, and Manny won.
Beckett : Whoa! Nice tail whip!
Castle : Oh, so you know the lingo.
Castle : Any extreme sports in your history I've yet to hear about?
Beckett : I think catching killers is pretty extreme.
Beckett : And then there's marrying you.
Castle : Yes. I admit I am extreme.
Castle : Extremely handsome.
UNK: Yeah. With a high degree of difficulty.
UNK: - WOMAN : Can I get an autograph? - MANNY : Yeah, no problem.
Beckett : There's Manny.
Manny : - A big heart for you. - WOMAN : Thanks.
Esposito : - Manny Castro? - Yeah, that's me.
Beckett : NYPD. We need to talk to you about Logan Moore.
Manny : Guy's a loser. What's there to talk about?
Beckett : How about his murder?
Manny : When Logan didn't show up for the event,
Manny : I didn't know what to think, but I sure as hell didn't kill him.
BECKETT : Manny, you repeatedly swore to do just that
Beckett : after he beat you in LA.
Castle : And in Austin. And Tampa.
Manny : I talk a lot of trash. The fans go nuts for it. It's all part of the show.
Beckett : We talked to the front desk at your hotel.
UNK: They said that you left at 10 : 00 p.m. Last night
