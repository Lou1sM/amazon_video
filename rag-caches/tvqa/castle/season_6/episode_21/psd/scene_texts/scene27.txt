UNK: Is that a construction site?
Castle : This could be footage of Jay Dixon's murder.
Tory : Here we go.

BECKETT : That's Tommy Fulton, CEO of New York Street Sports.
Castle : Looks like, six years later, Tommy made good on that promise.
Ross : Six years ago, Logan witnesses his friend's murder,
Castle : and then Tommy threatened to kill Logan
Castle : if he ever told what happened to Jay.
Fulton : After all these years, Logan couldn't live with the guilt,
UNK: and he came back to expose the truth.
Beckett : So the question is,
UNK: what was that tape doing in a law office,
Beckett : and how is Zaretsky connected to all of this?
Ryan : I think I figured that one out.
Ryan : Who do you suppose does all the contract work
Ryan : for the Street Sports Festival?
Ryan : Brett Zaretsky?
UNK: Yeah. And Zaretsky also represents Tommy Fulton personally.
Zaretsky : I hope you have a good reason for dragging us down here, Detective.
Beckett : How about murder?
Fulton : Come on. If this is about Logan,

Castle : And where were you on April 27th, 2008,
