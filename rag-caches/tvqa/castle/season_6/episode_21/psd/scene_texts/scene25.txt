Ryan : Hey, guys, check it out.
Ryan : Search team just found this camcorder
Ryan : down the block from where Logan was killed.
Ryan : A Hi8 camcorder.
Ryan : Yeah. CSU gave it a quick look. No prints. No cassette tape.
Ryan : But check it out.
UNK: Bullet hole. So Logan must've had this on him when he was shot.
Castle : Looks like someone tried to pry open the cassette slot.
RYAN : Yeah. The killer must've wanted whatever was inside.
Castle : I know why Logan bought the camera.
Castle : He didn't intend to record something. He wanted to play an old cassette tape.
