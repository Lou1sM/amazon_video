UNK: He phoned back yesterday, said he'd meet me if I gave him $3,000.
UNK: Why would he want three grand?
Enver : He just said he needed it.
Enver : And if that was the price to sit down with him, well, I was willing to pay it.
Enver : So I scraped up the cash.
UNK: He must've still been afraid of me. Showed up at the diner with a piece.
Enver : I gave him the money,
Enver : said how sorry I was for messing up his life.
UNK: Told him I'd even testify on his momma's behalf,
Enver : try to get her released early.
Beckett : And what did the two of you do afterwards?
Enver : He just said he had to take care of something before it was too late.
Enver : Then he took off. And I went home.
Ryan : - Hey, Castle. - Hey.
Ryan : I have something for you.
Lanie : - For me? - Yeah.
UNK: Recipe for shepherd's pie.
Castle : Is this the one Jenny made that night? That was outstanding.
