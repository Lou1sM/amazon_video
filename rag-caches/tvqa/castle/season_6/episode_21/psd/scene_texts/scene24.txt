UNK: Mrs. Moore : No. I mean, it was the first time that somebody that he knew died,
UNK: Mrs. Moore : so he took it hard.
Esposito : Jay Dixon, age 12. He died April 27th, 2008.
Esposito : Coroner ruled the death a homicide. It was never solved.
Beckett : What happened?
Esposito : COD was blunt force trauma to the head,
Esposito : and his body was found at a construction site.
Castle : Any leads on who did it?
Esposito : No, there were no witnesses, no suspects.
Esposito : All in all, it wasn't much of an investigation.
UNK: A 12-year-old kid gets killed and no one cares enough to find his murderer.
Manny : Logan did.
Castle : Finding justice for Jay seems to be the very reason he came to New York.
UNK: But why now, six years later?
Beckett : And why did Logan think he was running out of time?
Beckett : And what's the connection to Zaretsky or his law firm?
Esposito : If there is one, I haven't found it. He's not named in this file.
UNK: And there was no wrongful death
UNK: or other litigation against the property owners.
UNK: Okay, get a hold of Jay's parents.
UNK: Let's see if they'd been in contact with Logan recently.
