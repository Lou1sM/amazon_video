Beckett : after we take a look at that motocross bike in your garage
Beckett : and match it to the tire treads at the crime scene.

UNK: What are the odds they find the 9 mm you used to kill Logan?
UNK: Where are you going, huh?
UNK: GRUNTS

UNK: he's gonna get Ross DE Koning convicted for both murders.
UNK: At least Logan succeeded in his quest.
UNK: He found justice for his friend.
UNK: And to think all this happened
UNK: because Ross couldn't bear being second best.
UNK: So are you ready for another rematch?
UNK: Really?
Castle : You would deny me a chance at redemption?

UNK: ESPOSITO CLEARS THROAT
Ryan : Hey, Castle, you got a minute?
UNK: Yeah, we need to have a little man-chat.

Esposito : And, well, we know what you're going through.
Beckett : - You do? - Yeah.
Ryan : We know how tough it's been. So we decided to make it easy for you.
Ryan : You did?
Esposito : Yeah. We talked it over, and now you don't have to choose.
Esposito : We'll both be your best man.
Ryan : - Co-best men. - Yeah.
Ryan : And believe me, we're gonna do it up right for you.
Ryan : Best of both worlds, buddy.
UNK: Um...
UNK: Guys, I'm flattered, and honored.
Ryan : - You're welcome. - Yeah, you should be.
Castle : But I already decided.
