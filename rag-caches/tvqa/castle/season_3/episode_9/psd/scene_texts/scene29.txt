Bob : So Ashley tells me you're an author as well.
Bob : Tell me about your writing, Mr. Castle.
Bob : I don't read popular fiction. I find most of it crass and tawdry.
Castle : Yes. Right. Well...
UNK: I...
Castle : I think of my writing as character studies in human behavior,
Castle : looking into the heart of what makes people tick.
Castle : For instance, what would make an ordinary person like yourself
Castle : commit an act that's unusually heinous
UNK: or somehow out of character.
Castle : Would you excuse me for a moment?
UNK: Beckett.
Castle : Marie was acting out of character.
UNK: What self-respecting espionage agent would act strangely
Beckett : Well, that might explain the test results that Lanie just sent over.
