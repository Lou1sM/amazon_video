Beckett : You don't actually believe that Klingons are behind this, do you?
Castle : Killer aliens is a reach, even for me,
Castle : but government agents covering up the truth?
Castle : Not so crazy.
Beckett : Yes, it is.
Beckett : I mean, when this is all said and done,
Beckett : it will all come down to where and how she was killed,
Beckett : and I bet it will have nothing to do with secret agents,
Beckett : or massive government conspiracies.
Castle : I'll take that bet.
UNK: Detective?
Beckett : Where did everything go?
Ayyana : Two men came this morning with a federal warrant,
Ayyana : they loaded all of Marie's stuff into a truck.
Beckett : Who were they?
Beckett : From which agency?
Ayyana : They just said the government.
Castle : I'd like my payment in small bills, please.
Montgomery : My contact at Justice says no warrant was issued for Marie's office.
Beckett : Then people claiming to be federal agents seized her property.
UNK: I mean, there's got to be an explanation.
Castle : Men in Black.
Beckett : Other than that.
Montgomery : I'll put out more feelers. In the meantime, keep me posted.
Beckett : Okay, thank you.
Castle : Marie found proof and they covered it up.
Castle : It's just like Benny Stryker said.
Beckett : Do you honestly expect me to believe a theory,
Beckett : any theory, that ends with, "Like Benny Stryker said?"
Castle : What else could it be? Who made off with all her stuff?
Beckett : Maybe Marie was working on a classified government project,
Beckett : and they confiscated her data.
