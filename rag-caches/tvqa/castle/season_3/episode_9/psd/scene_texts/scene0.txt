UNK: Otherworldly.
UNK: Richard Castle : Honestly, sometimes it's like they're not even trying.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Doing the crossword in pen. Feeling cocky today, are we?
Castle : What is life without challenges?
UNK: Eight-letter word for "estrange."
Castle : Ah! You're just in time, my mini-thesaurus.
UNK: I need an eight-letter word for "estrange."
Martha : She doesn't hear you, darling. She's still talking to Ashley.
Castle : I should be timing that phone call. It's gotta be a record.
Martha : Please, I've had relationships that didn't last this long.
UNK: True.
UNK: Okay, bye.
Alexis : Sorry. We were talking about the hiking trip next Saturday.
UNK: Oh, did Ashley get the all clear from his parents to come with us?
Alexis : They say they want to meet you first.
UNK: Ah! They want to vet me.
Castle : To make sure if there's some kind of a rock slide,
Castle : that I won't leave their boy stranded on the mountain side,
Castle : having to gnaw off his own arm to survive.
Alexis : So you'll do it?
Castle : We'll have them over for dinner. We'll schmooze and impress them.
Martha : Would you like me to cook something?
Castle : No, we want to impress them.
Martha : And what is that supposed to mean?
