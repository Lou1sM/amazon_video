UNK: All right. Have CSU check for DNA, maybe we'll get lucky.
UNK: And can you look into explosive decompression?
Beckett : See what else might cause it?
Espostio : - You got it. - Thank you.
Castle : You do have to admit, the condition does seem otherworldly.
UNK: Marie Subbarao, before version.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Born in Chicago. Did post-grad work at Johns Hopkins,
UNK: and two years ago she takes a job at Aubrey Science Center in Midtown
UNK: Kevin Ryan : as an astrophysicist.
Beckett : Doing what?
UNK: I'm not really sure.
Ryan : According to the Center's website,
Ryan : she recently landed a grant from the SETI Institute.
Castle : The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, SETI?
Castle : That could explain...
Beckett : No, it couldn't.
UNK: So her working with SETI is just a wild coincidence?
Beckett : I'm saying it's an interesting fact that is unrelated to our case.
Beckett : Aliens were not involved in Marie Subbarao's death.
UNK: Um... I don't know.
Castle : Why, Detective Ryan, I never figured you for a believer.
Ryan : All I know is,
Ryan : my father's cousin Raymond left this party in Jersey one night.
Ryan : He's driving back to Queens and... Bam!
UNK: Blinding bright light comes down from the sky.
Ryan : Next thing he knows, it's morning,
UNK: he's on the side of the Jersey Turnpike.
Castle : Let me guess. No memory of what happened.
Beckett : That is not called an alien abduction.
Beckett : That is called a hangover.
Ryan : Maybe. Raymond always was the lightweight in the family.
UNK: Hmm. Speaking of family, did our victim have any?
Beckett : A husband, maybe?
UNK: The neighbors say she was single and lived alone.
Ryan : They barely saw her.
Ryan : Apparently, she normally came home from work around 10 : 00 p.m.
Beckett : Lanie said the time of death was around 9 : 00 p.m.
Beckett : Which means work was the last place that she was probably seen alive.
UNK: Dr. Chuck Vaughn : Marie was one of my most gifted researchers.
