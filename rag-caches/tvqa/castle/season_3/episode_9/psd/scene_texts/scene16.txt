Castle : It's like that Will Smith movie, only, I'm guessing, a lot less funny.
Stryker : These agents are real, Mr. Castle.
Stryker : They fear the revelation,
Stryker : that we are not alone would be too shocking.
Stryker : Hysteria would break out, nations would crumble.
Stryker : That's why they try to discredit believers like me,
Stryker : and eliminate people who threaten to expose the truth,
Stryker : people like Marie.
UNK: Bookstore confirmed that Stryker was signing his opus
UNK: between 7 : 00 and 10 : 00 p.m.
Beckett : Looks like we are back to an empty space in the suspect column.
Castle : Yeah, but at least our timeline is making more sense.
Castle : This whole Sunday-ish area, the life-changing event,
Castle : that's when she was abducted.
Castle : Wednesday, she leaves work,
Castle : that's when she was looking for proof of alien life.
Castle : Thursday, she comes back to work feeling better,
Castle : until she leaves and winds up explosively decompressed.
Castle : Overall, big week.
Beckett : You know what this timeline shows me?
Beckett : A lot of erratic behavior,
Beckett : that could be due to drug use, or any number of medical conditions.
Castle : All right.
UNK: Let's say Marie is a drug-addled psychotic with a brain tumor,
Castle : she still went looking for proof.
Beckett : She went looking for what she thought was proof.
Castle : Whatever it was, what if she found it?
Castle : Where would it be?
