UNK: he assumed that she'd been abducted.
Castle : Which she had been, only not by aliens, by Dr. Vaughn,
Castle : who drugged her to figure out how much she knew.
Castle : When he realized how close she was, he got rid of her.
Beckett : Yeah, but he's the one who told us about the altitude chamber.
Castle : Yeah, because he knew it would lead us to Marie's ex-boyfriend.
Esposito : Dr. Vaughn is gone. He's not at his place.
Esposito : But you know what is? Three vials of sodium pentothal.
Beckett : Any idea where he went?
UNK: But looks like he left in a rush.
Beckett : Call TSA and have him put on a "No-Fly" list
Beckett : and keep me posted.
Beckett : He's on the run.
Castle : If he heard we asked for those request forms,
UNK: he would've been tipped off.
Beckett : He probably had an escape plan in place
Beckett : just in case his cover was blown.
Castle : And Chinese handlers who can smuggle him out of the country.
Castle : Not to be negative, but the odds of catching this guy aren't great.
Beckett : Unless we enlist the help of a certain government agent
Beckett : who wants him just as bad as we do.
Westfield : I may want to put you guys on my friends and family plan.
Beckett : We now believe that Dr. Vaughn is the spy.
Beckett : Marie figured it out and then he killed her.
