UNK: What?
UNK: Guys.
Esposito : CSU finished going over the altitude chamber.
Esposito : - Nothing turned up. - What?
Beckett : I mean, that was the exact machine that we were looking for.
Beckett : Right in the building where Marie and her ex-boyfriend worked.
Beckett : That had to have been the murder weapon.
Esposito : No blood, no tissue. It's clean.
Beckett : That makes no sense, whatsoever.
Beckett : Check other altitude chambers.
Esposito : It's not like they grow on trees.
Beckett : Well, that can't be the only one around.
Beckett : And look for any other devices that cause the same injuries.
Esposito : I'll do my best.
UNK: If it is not an altitude chamber, then what could it be?
Beckett : Other than that.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Lanie, what you find?
Lanie : Not the answers I was looking for, instead, just more questions.
Castle : How deliciously cryptic.
Lanie : Because of the unique nature of Marie's injuries,
Lanie : I wanted to thoroughly document her condition
Lanie : before conducting the autopsy.
Lanie : While I was taking the X-rays,
UNK: I saw this embedded in her sinus cavity.
Martha : What is that?
Lanie : I have no idea.
Castle : Call me crazy,
UNK: but that looks just like an alien implant.
Castle : What could you possibly be looking for by probing up there?
