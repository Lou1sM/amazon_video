Westfield : The intercepted transmissions coincided with Marie's tasking
Stryker : her radio telescope to point at our satellite.
UNK: Which was nowhere near
Westfield : where she was supposed to be doing her research.
Castle : So that wasn't a photo of a UFO. That was your spy satellite.
Westfield : But the real damage done is the data she downloaded,
Westfield : which I fear is now in the hands of the Chinese.
Beckett : So then who killed her?
Westfield : Her handler, I imagine.
UNK: The Chinese must've known we were on to them.
