Westfield : I'm inclined to agree.
Westfield : Which leaves the Agency with some egg on its face.
Beckett : And which agency did you say that was again?
Westfield : I didn't.
Westfield : We dug deeper on Dr. Vaughn.
Ryan : Turns out he has a fondness for gambling.
Westfield : He ran up quite the tab at an Atlantic City casino
Westfield : controlled by the Chinese.
Westfield : After that, they owned him.
UNK: Do you know where Vaughn is now?
Westfield : I know where to start looking.
Westfield : Using his cell phone number, I can triangulate his position.
Beckett : Well, he's got to be worried about being tracked.
Beckett : He probably turned it off.
Westfield : Then we'll just turn it back on.
Castle : You can do that?
Westfield : We turned off your phones, didn't we?
Castle : Yeah, and the car.
