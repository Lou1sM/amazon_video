UNK: you can discretely let me know with a brutal kick to the shin.
Alexis : I won't be there.
Alexis : They thought it would be better if it was with just you and Gram.
UNK: You're gonna leave me alone?
Alexis : You'll do great.
UNK: I just wanted to make sure that you'll make a good impression.
Beckett : Trust me,
Castle : so do I.
Castle : Where do you come down on deficit spending
UNK: during an economic downturn?
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: I take the theory that's held by most economists,
Beckett : that deficit spending is acceptable
Beckett : as long as it focuses on public investment,
Beckett : like infrastructure, defense, education, research.
Castle : Wow! Where did that answer come from?
UNK: A semester of Economic Theory at NYU.
UNK: Where did the question come from?
Castle : Trying out conversation starters.
Beckett : Well, we started a conversation, so I guess it worked.
Castle : Kind of.
Castle : It's for a dinner with Ashley's parents,
Castle : he's this stuffy economist, you know?
UNK: I just want to win them over, get them on my side.
Castle : What if they don't take to me?
UNK: Come on, Castle. They'll take to you.
UNK: - Really? Thanks. - Yeah.
Beckett : So long as you don't act like yourself.
Castle : Nice one.
Castle : So, where do we stand on this mysterious implant?
Beckett : It is not an implant.
Beckett : Lanie says that it's a metal fragment.
Beckett : She's running tests on it right now.
Castle : How did it get up her nose?
UNK: Maybe it was a piece of the altitude chamber that got lodged up there.
