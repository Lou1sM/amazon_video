Beckett : So our murder suspect is meeting his handler.
Westfield : Which means Dr. Vaughn may still have the data.
Castle : Well, then let's go get him.
Castle : Where are the Predator Drones, the Black helicopters?
Castle : All those SWAT teams rappelling down on ropes?
Westfield : Budget cuts.
Westfield : It's vital to our national security that we take these men alive.
Castle : These guys are trained agents.
Castle : They probably have cyanide capsules in their teeth
Castle : in case they're caught.
Westfield : We'll worry about their teeth when the time comes.
Ryan : Patrol cars have closed off all streets in a five-block radius.
UNK: And air support's on the way.
UNK: All right. What's the plan?
Westfield : Vaughn's cell phone signal has gone dark,
Westfield : which means he's underground.
Westfield : According to our intel, this building has an extensive basement
UNK: with two methods of ingress.
Beckett : Actually, most of the basements on this side of town
Beckett : are linked through doorways used as escape routes
Beckett : for illegals in case of an INS raid.
Westfield : So you're saying that Vaughn and Kyu
Westfield : could be in either of the adjoining buildings as well?
Beckett : Welcome to New York.
Castle : Let's go.
Beckett : NYPD. Stay where you are.
UNK: That's a vacuum packer. One o'clock.
Beckett : Looks like we found our murder weapon.
Beckett : Have you seen this man?
Beckett : Go, go.
Beckett : Semester abroad?
Castle : No, TV show I used to love.
Beckett : - Nice job. - Thanks.
Kyu : Get on your knees.
Vaughn : Wait, please.
Vaughn : I got rid of Marie.
Vaughn : I did everything you asked.
Vaughn : Wait, wait, wait.
Vaughn : I can still help you.
UNK: Wait! Wait, wait, please!
UNK: I can still help you. Please!
Beckett : NYPD! Drop that gun!
Westfield : On the ground!
UNK: Now!
Castle : Cyanide capsule!
UNK: Ew! Gum.
Castle : False alarm.
Westfield : Where's the data?
Vaughn : In a USB drive.
Vaughn : In his pocket.
Ryan : Think we'll get a medal for this?
Westfield : This never happened.
Castle : Guess that means I can't put this on Twitter.
Westfield : Vaughn's already spilling his guts.
Castle : Yeah. A near execution will shake your loyalties like that.
UNK: Between his confession and the espionage charges,
Westfield : he and Ung Kyu will spend the rest of their lives in federal prison.
Westfield : Thanks to you.
Beckett : And to Castle.
UNK: Yes. And Mr. Castle.
UNK: Might I have a private word with Detective Beckett?
Beckett : Of course.
Castle : Hey, sweetie. Look, about the parental review,
Castle : I failed and I know, and I'm sorry.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Castle : They found me fascinating?
Castle : Camping with... They want to go camping with us? No?
UNK: No. No. Yeah. That'd be great.
UNK: That'd be so much fun.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Castle : I love you, too. Bye.
UNK: So, what did he tell you?
Beckett : He told me something in confidence.
UNK: What?
Beckett : I wish I could tell you, Castle. But it was classified.
UNK: What did he to tell you that was classified?
Castle : Was it about aliens? The truth about UFOs?
UNK: Are you gonna tell me or just gonna make me keep guessing?
Ryan : I don't know. This guessing thing is kind of fun.
Castle : All right. Was it about what happened at Roswell?
UNK: No.
Castle : - Area 51? - No.
Castle : Loch Ness monster is real?
Beckett : - Yeah. - Really?
UNK: Richard Castle : - No. - You had me.
Castle : - They're controlling the weather. - No.
Castle : - Our thoughts? - No.
UNK: Our buying habits?
UNK: Actually speaking of shopping...
