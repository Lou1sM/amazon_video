Beckett : The altitude chamber we haven't found?
UNK: Yet.
Beckett : The altitude chamber that we haven't found yet.
UNK: And I am sure that as soon as we do
Beckett : it will lead us straight to our killer.
UNK: I notice you said "killer," and not Ted Carter.
Beckett : Yeah, Carter alibied out.
Beckett : He ordered pizza the night of Marie's murder,
UNK: and signed for it at 8 : 25.
UNK: Alibis in 30 minutes or less.
Castle : So at this point, we have no human suspect.
Beckett : By definition, no suspect means no human suspect.
Ryan : Well, one might be coming your way.
Ryan : I checked Marie's phone logs at work.
Ryan : Turns out, she made a 30-minute phone call,
Ryan : before she left the Science Center on Wednesday.
Beckett : To whom?
Ryan : Benny Stryker.
Castle : The Benny Stryker? This Benny Stryker?
Ryan : One and the same.
UNK: An astrophysicist and a uflogist? Isn't that like oil and water?
Ryan : Actually, they used to be colleagues.
Ryan : Three years ago, he and Marie were members of the same research team.
Ryan : But Marie was worried
Ryan : that all his UFO talk would destroy their credibility,
Ryan : so she had him kicked off the team.
Ryan : From what I hear, there's been bad blood ever since.
Beckett : Where can we find Stryker?
UNK: lmprisoned in a cold white room.
UNK: Benny Stryker : Strange faces staring down at us.
UNK: Benny Stryker : These are images that will haunt us,
UNK: Benny Stryker : but they'll also unite us.
UNK: Benny Stryker : And help us remember,
UNK: Benny Stryker : we didn't choose this.
UNK: Benny Stryker : We were chosen.
Stryker : One more time, we didn't choose this, we were chosen.
