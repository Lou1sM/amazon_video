Ted : So, I went looking for her at the Center.
Ryan : What happened when you found her?
UNK: Nothing.
Ted : We talked for a few seconds.
Ted : She seemed upset about something.
Ted : I tried to find out what,
Ted : but she was in a hurry to get somewhere.
Ted : So I left.
Ted : I went home.
UNK: I was there by 8 : 00.
Esposito : Make yourself at home.
UNK: You're gonna be here for a while.
Beckett : CSU is going through the altitude chamber,
Beckett : once they get back with forensics,
Beckett : we should be able to charge Ted Carter.
Castle : Tell me this,
Castle : how did Carter get the body to the rail yard?
Beckett : Well, the altitude chamber is right next to the parking garage,
Beckett : so he probably dumped her body in the car,
Beckett : took it out to the rail yard, and tried to throw us off the trail.
Castle : - You know what would be a better story? - Hmm?
Beckett : We have an earth-bound solution to this mystery
Beckett : and you are disappointed. I get it.
Beckett : But that? Really?
UNK: Come on, Marie said she had a life-changing event.
UNK: What could be more life-changing than being beamed up by this guy?
UNK: Come on, Castle.
UNK: We all know that there is no such thing as alien abductions.
