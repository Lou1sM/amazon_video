Beckett : Sir, can I talk to you?
UNK: No. Go ahead. Kiss your daughter goodbye.
UNK: Please!
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Social Services is right outside that door.
UNK: Nazihah Alhabi : - Please, why are you doing this? - Nazihah.
UNK: - Nazihah means "honesty," right? - Why are you doing this?
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : - Is that what it means in Arabic? - I swear I don't know.
UNK: I'm going to give you one more chance to be honest with me,
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : or I will take your baby away, and you will never see it again.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : - Do you understand? - I swear.
UNK: Nazihah Alhabi : I swear to you, I don't know. I don't know anything!
UNK: Nazihah Alhabi : Please don't take her away from me. She's the only thing I have. Please.
UNK: Please.
UNK: All right.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Nobody's going to take your baby away from you.
