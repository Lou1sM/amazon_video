Montgomery : let me remind you not to discuss it with anyone.
Montgomery : Not even family.
Montgomery : We can't afford to have word leak out and cause a panic.
Montgomery : Let me turn this over to Agent Fallon.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Thank you, Captain.
UNK: All right, folks, here's what we know.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Amir Alhabi built a bomb in storage unit C-4-1-2.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : It's a dirty bomb, designed to explode and disperse
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : a highly radioactive cobalt 60.
UNK: And that bomb is missing.
UNK: I called Jenny to tell her I'd be late.
UNK: I tried to get her to go visit her mom.
Esposito : Yeah, I did the same thing with Lanie.
UNK: It didn't work. She hates her mom.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : interview facility employees. Check surveillance video.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : You know the drill.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : We find the person who moved the bomb,
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : we'll find where it is.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Let's get on it.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Mr. Castle, I'd like to thank you for your fine work on this case.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : However, I can't have civilians on the front lines.
Castle : It's as though I'm getting a raise and getting fired at the same time.
Esposito : Except that you don't actually work here.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : It's for your own protection.
Castle : Well, my friend, the governor, will be very disappointed to hear it.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Just try and stay out of the way.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Detective Beckett, a word?
