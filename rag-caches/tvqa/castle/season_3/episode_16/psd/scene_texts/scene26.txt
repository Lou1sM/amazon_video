Castle : Do you realize what this means?
Beckett : If Amir didn't know about the money,
UNK: then he couldn't have been paid to build that bomb.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Can I speak with the two of you, please?
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : I like to cover my bases.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : So you can imagine my surprise when I find out
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : one of our own is having a non-fat latte
UNK: with the suspect in this investigation.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : I have agents on Fariq Yusef.
UNK: If you just allow me explain.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : I don't even know what you're doing here.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : And you go and talk to a foreign official?
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : What if the Syrians are behind this?
Castle : Do you have any idea what you've done?
Castle : Jamal and Amir are not terrorists. You're chasing the wrong guys!
Castle : Do you have any idea how many laws you've broken?
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : I ought to have you arrested.
UNK: Sir, I think what Castle's trying...
Montgomery : Detective Beckett, did you know about this?
Beckett : Yes, I did.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Well, that's disappointing.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : In the interest of national security,
UNK: I'm going to have to have the both of you removed from this task force,
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : - do you understand? - Sir.
Montgomery : Beckett's the best I have.
