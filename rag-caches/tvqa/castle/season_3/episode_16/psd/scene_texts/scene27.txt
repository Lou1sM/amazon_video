Montgomery : Now Castle can be a pain in the ass, but he thinks outside the box.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : It's not your party anymore, Captain.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : I'll have my agents escort you out.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : And Castle.
Castle : The governor.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : He's never heard of you.
Beckett : Where are Alexis and Martha?
Castle : I sent them out of town.
Beckett : Do they know why?
UNK: No. Did you get a hold of Josh?
UNK: I couldn't get through to his cell. He's probably already on the plane.
UNK: A 600 thread-count shower curtain murder board.
Castle : I snapped a photo of it as we were being thrown out.
Castle : And, here,
UNK: I have Amir's driving data.
UNK: It's like our own mini precinct.
Beckett : - Except it smells better. - Thank you.
Beckett : Castle, even if Amir is innocent, Jamal isn't.
Castle : His guilt is predicated on Amir being a terrorist.
Castle : Without that, Jamal's just another guy moving a crate.
Castle : This all comes back to Amir.
Castle : What we need to do, is solve his murder.
