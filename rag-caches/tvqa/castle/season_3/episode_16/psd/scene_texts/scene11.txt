Beckett : I just wish that it...
Beckett : I wish that I had someone who would be there for me,
Beckett : and I could be there for him,
UNK: and we could just dive into it together.
UNK: Hazmat Specialist : You're free to go.
Montgomery : We are?
Beckett : What about the radiation?
UNK: Hazmat Specialist : We found residual traces of cobalt 60 in the storage unit.
UNK: Hazmat Specialist : Not enough to cause any health problems.
Montgomery : Detective Beckett. Castle. We're all real glad you two are okay.
Beckett : Thanks, sir, so are we.
Beckett : I'm confused, though. Is this just a false alarm?
Montgomery : Not exactly.
Montgomery : If you're up to it, we really could use you back at the precinct.
Montgomery : I can fill you in on the way.
Castle : Those traces of cobalt 60. Where did they come from?
Montgomery : We think there was a second crate at the storage unit,
Montgomery : which contained large quantities of cobalt 60.
UNK: We found wire and crimp-on connectors which leads us to believe
Montgomery : the crate was outfitted with explosives.
Castle : - A bomb. - A dirty bomb.
Beckett : Where is it now?
Montgomery : That's what we're trying to find out.
Alexis : Hey, Dad. Late night?
Castle : Still going. I just came back to change my clothes.
Martha : Well, bid my ego adieu. I'm off to the Oasis.
Martha : Minus Alexis, thanks to you.
UNK: Actually, I change my mind about that.
Castle : - You have? - You have?
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : I think it's important you have time together.
Martha : Oh! My faith in you is restored.
Alexis : Dad, what about my Physics test? I can't just leave.
Castle : Yeah, sure you can. Just take them with you.
UNK: I haven't packed or anything. I can't...
Martha : Honey, everything is provided there. We're going to have so much fun!
Martha : Come on, let's get a bag.
UNK: Go. It'll be good for you.
