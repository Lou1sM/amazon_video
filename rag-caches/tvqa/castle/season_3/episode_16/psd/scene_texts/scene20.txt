Beckett : The money that you traced back to Afghanistan.
UNK: To a bank outside Bagram Airbase often used by military personnel.

Beckett : Castle, the keys that we used to open that storage unit
Beckett : are from Amir's keychain.
Castle : The killer could've put the key there.
UNK: All these bread crumbs that have led us to Amir and Jamal.
