Castle : He installs cameras to gather evidence.
Castle : Only, they found out and they killed him.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : That means that a passenger was involved.
Beckett : A regular passenger.
Castle : Right. And they mentioned the storage facility,
Castle : which is where he got the C-4-1-2-1-6-5-2.
Beckett : But why would a passenger talk about the storage unit in front of Amir?
Beckett : Especially if they were going to frame him?
Castle : Maybe we're going about this all wrong.
Castle : You are right.
Castle : A passenger wouldn't openly discuss a terrorist plot.
Castle : But a driver might,
Castle : in the car, to a collaborator,
Castle : alone, on the phone.
Castle : What if Amir suspected another driver?
Castle : Okay, here is Kevin McCann's last shift.
UNK: This is a day before the murder.
Castle : And look at that.
Castle : He stopped near the storage facility where they kept the cobalt 60.
Beckett : He's a cab driver, Castle. He was probably dropping off a fare.
Beckett : Besides, he alibi-ed out.
Castle : There he is, near the warehouse, too.
Castle : That's 100 yards from where we found Amir's body.
Castle : So the last two places Amir was,
Castle : and Kevin McCann has been to both of them?
Castle : There's no way that that's a coincidence.
Castle : We at least have to go see why this warehouse area is so popular.
UNK: Montgomery.
UNK: Okay. Got it.
UNK: We got a location on the truck.
