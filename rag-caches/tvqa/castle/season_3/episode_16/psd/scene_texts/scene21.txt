Castle : What if they were left there for us to find?
UNK: Castle...
Castle : Something else is going on here.
Beckett : Okay, fine, what would you like us to do?
Castle : Talk to the one person who has a different view of Amir.
UNK: But I'm going to need your help.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Jamal bought these trucks over two months ago.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : It's a perfect cover for moving material without anyone noticing.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Where's the list of his employees?
Esposito : Just came in. Nine guys, all Middle Eastern.
UNK: All right, they're all probably part of the cell.
UNK: Let's get their twenties and then move on them.
Ryan : Got a purchase on Jamal's credit card three weeks ago for a burner phone.
UNK: Run it down. Let's see if we can pull up any recent activity.
Beckett : Jamal's moving trucks are parked in a lot in Queens.
Beckett : They're all accounted for except for one five-ton.
Beckett : And the log says Jamal checked it out 12 hours ago,
Beckett : never brought it back.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : He must've used it to move the crate.
