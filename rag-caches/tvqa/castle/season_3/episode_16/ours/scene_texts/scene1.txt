UNK: Leman Jones : I found those car parts.
Beckett : On the car that you stripped.
Beckett : We have a witness who places you at the scene.
Beckett : So, please, just stop with the lying.
Beckett : A witness?
UNK: Leman Jones : Okay. I stripped that taxi. It's what I do.
Beckett : After you killed the driver.
UNK: Leman Jones : After I what? No! I didn't kill any driver, 'cause there was no driver.
Castle : He was left in the warehouse.
Beckett : Robbed and shot in the head.
UNK: Leman Jones : Well, not by me. Okay?
UNK: Leman Jones : I was cruising, and I saw the cab sitting empty,
UNK: Leman Jones : and I figure, no sense in letting good parts go to waste.
Beckett : What time was that?
UNK: - I don't know. About 11 : 15, probably. - Oh!
Castle : Well, there you go. That's right when he died.
UNK: Leman Jones : Look, no. I don't hurt people.
UNK: Leman Jones : I'm just a car guy.
UNK: Leman Jones : Your witness must've done it. That's it.
UNK: And now he's just playing innocent bystander or something.
Beckett : There was no witness.
UNK: Leman Jones : What do you mean?
Beckett : I was bluffing.
Beckett : - Bluffing? - Yes.
UNK: No!
Castle : Yeah, she's allowed to do that. I'm surprised you don't know that.
UNK: Leman Jones : No, I mean, there was a guy there. I saw him.
Beckett : What guy? Describe him.
UNK: Leman Jones : I didn't get a clear look. He ran off when I pulled up.
UNK: Leman Jones : But he was there.
UNK: Leman Jones : He was there looking for something in the car.
Castle : What makes you say that?
UNK: Leman Jones : Because he did a number on the interior. He tore up the upholstery.
Esposito : Think he's telling the truth?
