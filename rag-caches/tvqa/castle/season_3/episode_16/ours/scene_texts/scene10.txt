Beckett : He's a cab driver, Castle. He was probably dropping off a fare.
Beckett : Besides, he alibi-ed out.
Castle : There he is, near the warehouse, too.
Castle : That's 100 yards from where we found Amir's body.
Castle : So the last two places Amir was,
Castle : and Kevin McCann has been to both of them?
Castle : There's no way that that's a coincidence.
Castle : We at least have to go see why this warehouse area is so popular.
UNK: Montgomery.
UNK: Okay. Got it.
UNK: We got a location on the truck.
UNK: Senior Officer : One of my guys on the grid search spotted it.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : - The radiation detector go off? - You bet.
Montgomery : How long has it been sitting here?
UNK: Senior Officer : Not long. The hood's still warm.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Open her up!
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Check all the buildings!
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Sweep every inch in a four-block radius.
Beckett : Looks empty.
Castle : This is where Kevin McCann parked.
Beckett : Castle, door.
Beckett : We gotta move.
Beckett : Ready? Go.
UNK: Beckett?
Castle : It's Jamal.
