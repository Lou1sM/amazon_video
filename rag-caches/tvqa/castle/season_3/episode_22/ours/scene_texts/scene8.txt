Montgomery : You know, I'm trying to decide who is the worse liar.
Montgomery : Him or you.
Montgomery : Go find Violet Young. Help Beckett put this thing to bed, all right?
Ryan : - Yes, sir. - We're on it.
Castle : - Hey, Detective... - Hey.
Seeger : You run wild in my city, then you call me for a favor?
Seeger : You got a lot of nerve, Detective. I'll give you that.
Beckett : Hey, we're trying to get a vicious criminal off of your streets.
Castle : Hey. Can I interest you in one of these robes?
Castle : Before you say no, feel how soft this is.
Seeger : No. Thank you.
Beckett : Look, we're all on the same team now.
Beckett : So why don't we just get this done with?
Seeger : As long as it gets done my way.
Beckett : Fine. What do you got?
Seeger : Well, Ganz's phone is a burner and so are most of the numbers he called.
Beckett : Which means you didn't get the buyer's ID.
Seeger : We did manage to trace one of the burners he called to New York City.
Beckett : Mannis. That's Ganz's partner.
Castle : I bet Ganz was calling to ask why the hell Violet Young was still alive.
UNK: Did you happen to get the location on Mannis' phone?
Seeger : Just that it's in Manhattan.
Beckett : Okay, so, let's call him. Rile him up a bit.
Seeger : Rile him up how?
Beckett : I'll tell him I met Ganz. Ganz was gonna cut him out of the deal.
Beckett : Mannis wasn't pulling his weight.
Castle : Mannis gets pissed, he calls Ganz.
Castle : Maybe one of them lets something slip about the location of the exchange.
Seeger : And we'll be listening. Good. I'll try and get a warrant.
Violet : I know it was wrong to run. I was afraid to go to the cops.
Violet : I never meant for Royce to get hurt.
Ryan : Let's just get back to the station, we can work it all out. All right?
Esposito : Let's go.
UNK: Gun!
UNK: Down! Down!
Esposito : You okay?
Ryan : Yeah. You? - Yeah.
Esposito : - You okay? - Yeah.
UNK: Stay right here, all right?
UNK: Yo.
UNK: Esposito?
UNK: Beckett?
Beckett : Are you with Mannis?
Esposito : Yeah. I just shot him.
Beckett : Look, we need to know where and when Ganz is selling those bullets.
UNK: Done.
Esposito : Where's the deal going down?
Mannis : I'm hit, man. Call an ambulance.
UNK: Well, my partner's on that.
UNK: 91... What... What comes after that?
Mannis : I'm in pain here, man!
Esposito : It's over, Mannis.
Esposito : Give us the meet location, I'll tell the DA in LA that you cooperated.
Mannis : Now call an ambulance!
Ryan : Who shot Royce?
Mannis : It was Ganz.
Tony : You get that?
Beckett : Yeah. We got it. Thanks.
UNK: I gotta get to Santa Monica Pier.
UNK: It's quarter of 6 : 00 now.
UNK: This is gonna be our last chance to get Ganz.
Seeger : Okay. Let's roll.
Seeger : LAPD. Freeze.
Seeger : Put the case down. Put the case down.
Seeger : Put your hands behind your head.
Beckett : You in the van! Police! Both hands out the window!
Beckett : Open the door! Get out slow!
