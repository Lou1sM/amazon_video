Beckett : Up against the van.
Beckett : Up against the van!
Beckett : Give me your hand.
Beckett : Where is he? Where's Ganz?

Castle : Where did Beckett go?
UNK: Police!
UNK: Stop!
Ganz : I knew you were a cop.
Beckett : My name is Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.
Beckett : Michael Royce was my friend.
Beckett : You shot him and you left him in an alley like a piece of garbage.
Beckett : Consider this poetic justice.
Ganz : He said something about hell raining down on me.
UNK: I never imagined hell looked like you.
UNK: Kate!
UNK: Russell Ganz, you are under arrest for the murder of Michael Royce.
UNK: Are you okay?
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : So, how close did you come?
Castle : With Ganz.
Beckett : Let's go home, Castle.
