Beckett : Seeger, if you're here to drive us to the airport, we're not packed yet.
Seeger : I'm here because a report crossed my desk.
Seeger : About a theft at Kelvin North America.
Seeger : Your names jumped out at me.
Seeger : Now, tell me.
UNK: What does a theft of high-tech bullets
Castle : have to do with your murder investigation?
Beckett : We're not investigating a murder anymore, remember?
Beckett : We're off the case.
UNK: Are we gonna do that dance?
Beckett : Look. We don't know any more about that theft than you do.
Castle : But if we stumble across something on our way to the airport,
UNK: we'll be sure and let you know.
Seeger : See that you do.
Montgomery : - Detective. - Goodbye.
Castle : Are you sure it's such a good idea cutting him out?
Castle : He might be able to help us.
Beckett : Castle, the only thing Seeger cares about is that robbery,
Beckett : not Royce's murder.
Beckett : What we need to do is question that guard, Reggie Walsh.
Castle : Yeah, but how? You're not a cop here, remember?
