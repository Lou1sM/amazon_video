Beckett : Where is he?
Montgomery : Turn around and go back home and let me handle this. All right?
Beckett : Sir, I've seen dead bodies before.
Castle : Come on, Kate. You don't want to remember him like this.
Beckett : Castle, if it was me lying there, would you just walk away?
Lanie : I'm so sorry, honey.
Beckett : Just tell me what happened.
Lanie : He was shot in the leg.
Lanie : Judging from the blood trail, I'd say the bullet broke the bone.
Lanie : He tried to hide, but...
Lanie : I found this in his pocket.
Lanie : He just flew in from Los Angeles this afternoon.
Castle : What was he doing in LA?
Beckett : I heard he moved there after he lost his bounty hunter's license.
Beckett : I guess he was trying to make a fresh start.
Castle : When was the last time you spoke to him?
Beckett : When I arrested him.
