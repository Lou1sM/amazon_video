Beckett : Violet's commercial shoot's on stage seven.
UNK: Rick Castle! I cannot believe we finally got you out here.
UNK: Tony, you money-grubbing bastard.
Castle : How's filming?
UNK: You're kidding me? It's awesome, buddy.
Tony : You keep writing them, we'll keep making them.
Castle : Tony, I want you to meet Kate Beckett.
Castle : This is the inspiration for Nikki Heat.
Tony : Wow. With your looks, honey, you could be an actress.
Beckett : I'm completely comfortable being a cop. I'm going to go and look for Violet.
Beckett : - It was nice to meet you. - You, too.
Tony : She's hot.
Tony : No wonder your sex scenes are so steamy.
Castle : So, where's our Nikki Heat? Natalie Rhodes.
UNK: What?
