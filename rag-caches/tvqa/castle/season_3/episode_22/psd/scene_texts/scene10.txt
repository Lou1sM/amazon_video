UNK: Gene Simmons : If you give me a chance I'll go find it.
Beckett : Thank you.
Castle : This is so weird.
UNK: What?
Castle : I've dressed up as him for Halloween.
Beckett : I did, too.
Castle : Violet Young. A smoking-hot wannabe starlet
Beckett : What kind of trouble would an actress be in
Beckett : that would scare Royce into running?
Beckett : What are you doing?
Beckett : What are you doing?
UNK: I'm gonna get a hold of Violet's agent, see if I can find out where she is.
Esposito : Yo, Ryan, what's up?
Ryan : We got lucky.
Ryan : Kids were tagging that building across from the alley,
Ryan : so the owner put up a camera.
Ryan : There's our shooter.
UNK: We can't see his face, or the license plate number.
Ryan : But you can see the driver's arm.
Esposito : Black guy. Ebony to our killer's ivory.
UNK: You still got that friend at TSA?
Esposito : Yeah, why?
Ryan : Maybe they'll share surveillance footage of the security checkpoint
Ryan : that our shooter went through.
UNK: The guy was in town for six hours, right?
Ryan : There's a chance that he's wearing the same clothes at the airport
Ryan : that he's wearing in our video.
Esposito : Which might get us a look at his face.
Beckett : So Violet's shooting a commercial at Zenith Studios.
Castle : It's kismet!
