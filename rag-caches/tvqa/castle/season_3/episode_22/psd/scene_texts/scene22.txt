Beckett : Easy, guys.
Reggie : Yeah. I mean, we all wear the uniform, right?

Beckett : So, as a courtesy,
UNK: I am going to let you cover up with my jacket.
Beckett : I wouldn't take it off before we get into the interview room.
Beckett : There might be reporters on the inside.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : In prison, you're the lowest of the low.

Castle : And you know what they do to guys like you in Lompoc.
UNK: No.
