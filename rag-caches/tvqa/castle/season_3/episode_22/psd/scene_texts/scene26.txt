UNK: Stay right here, all right?
UNK: Yo.
UNK: Esposito?
UNK: Beckett?
Beckett : Are you with Mannis?
Esposito : Yeah. I just shot him.
Beckett : Look, we need to know where and when Ganz is selling those bullets.
UNK: Done.
Esposito : Where's the deal going down?
Mannis : I'm hit, man. Call an ambulance.
UNK: Well, my partner's on that.
UNK: 91... What... What comes after that?
Mannis : I'm in pain here, man!
Esposito : It's over, Mannis.
Esposito : Give us the meet location, I'll tell the DA in LA that you cooperated.
Mannis : Now call an ambulance!
Ryan : Who shot Royce?
Mannis : It was Ganz.
Tony : You get that?
Beckett : Yeah. We got it. Thanks.
UNK: I gotta get to Santa Monica Pier.
UNK: It's quarter of 6 : 00 now.
UNK: This is gonna be our last chance to get Ganz.
Seeger : Okay. Let's roll.
Seeger : LAPD. Freeze.
Seeger : Put the case down. Put the case down.
Seeger : Put your hands behind your head.
Beckett : You in the van! Police! Both hands out the window!
Beckett : Open the door! Get out slow!
UNK: Slowly.
Beckett : Up against the van.
Beckett : Up against the van!
Beckett : Give me your hand.
Beckett : Where is he? Where's Ganz?
Beckett : Where is he?
UNK: Bingo.
Castle : Where did Beckett go?
UNK: Police!
UNK: Stop!
Ganz : I knew you were a cop.
Beckett : My name is Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.
Beckett : Michael Royce was my friend.
Beckett : You shot him and you left him in an alley like a piece of garbage.
Beckett : Consider this poetic justice.
