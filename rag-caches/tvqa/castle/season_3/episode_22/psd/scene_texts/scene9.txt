Castle : In LA for all of a minute and already she's spouting cheesy movie dialogue.
Castle : Must be something in the air.
UNK: This is Royce's place?
UNK: This is the address listed on his driver's license.
Castle : Did I miss the part where you told me he was rich?
Beckett : No. He was barely scraping by.
Castle : Yeah, I'm a friend of Mike Royce's.
UNK: Jerry, I cannot help you out, I'm sorry.
UNK: You gotta go without... Yeah.
UNK: I gotta go. Hello.
UNK: Whoa! You're Gene Simmons.
UNK: Gene Simmons : Yeah, I'm that weird guy in KISS.
UNK: Gene Simmons : Yeah, the guy with the long tongue and everything...
UNK: Hello. Who's this pretty little lady?
Beckett : I'm Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.
UNK: Gene Simmons : Is Mike in trouble?
Beckett : Actually, he was murdered.
UNK: Gene Simmons : That's terrible.
Castle : How did you know him exactly?
UNK: Gene Simmons : Well, I got into trouble a few months back.
UNK: Gene Simmons : And Royce helped me out, I helped him.
UNK: Gene Simmons : And I've been letting him live in my guest house.
Beckett : So you're saying he was in the business of helping people in trouble?
UNK: Gene Simmons : He was pretty good at it.
Castle : Was he helping anyone lately?
UNK: Gene Simmons : Well, there was a girl. She came by two days ago.
UNK: Gene Simmons : Really beautiful. Stunning.
Castle : This girl. Do you remember her name?
Beckett : You know what? She dropped off a head shot.
