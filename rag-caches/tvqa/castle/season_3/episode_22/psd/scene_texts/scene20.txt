Castle : What did you pack, a murder board?
Castle : Maurice is amazing, isn't he?
Castle : I bet if I ordered the Ark of the Covenant, he'd come through.
Beckett : Wouldn't you be afraid to open it?
Castle : No, it only melts Nazis.
Castle : Is that Kelvin North America?
Beckett : Yeah, I'm trying to figure out this heist.
Beckett : Kelvin said that the last time that vault was accessed
UNK: was at 11 : 46 Tuesday night.
Castle : Well, that must be when our thieves stole the high-tech ammo.
Beckett : Eight hundred pounds worth.
Beckett : And they would have had to take it out the loading dock.
Castle : But that guard station there,
Castle : I remember seeing that when we went in.
Castle : There's no way they could get all that ammo past him
Castle : without a little insider help.
UNK: Exactly. So I called the security company.
Beckett : And they said that the only guard
Beckett : that was stationed at the loading bay that night
Beckett : was some guy named Reggie Walsh.
Castle : I feel the plot about to thicken.
Beckett : He asked to be reassigned the next day.
Beckett : Are you expecting anyone?
UNK: No.
Beckett : Hey, wait. Wait...
Castle : Detective Seeger.
Maurice : Mr. Castle. Do come in.
Seeger : Wow! Nice digs.
Seeger : Sure pays to travel with a best-selling author, huh?
