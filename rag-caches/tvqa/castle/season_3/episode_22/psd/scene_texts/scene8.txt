Castle : Okay, look. The studio comped me a two-bedroom four-star suite.
Castle : You just stay with me.
Beckett : Yeah, right.
Castle : What? You'll have your own room.
Beckett : No. I am not staying with you.
Castle : Worried you can't control yourself when we're alone.
Beckett : Actually, it's not me that I'm worried about.
UNK: I assure you, my intentions are pure.
Maurice : We're so happy to have you back, Mr. Castle.
Maurice : I've taken the liberty of setting up the suite just the way you like it.
Beckett : Thank you.
Maurice : And I've scheduled a couple's massage at 7 : 00.
Beckett : Pure, huh?
Castle : Maurice, you can go ahead and cancel that.
Castle : And get rid of the flowers and the champagne.
Castle : We're here to work.
Maurice : Very good, sir.
Beckett : For you.
Castle : Thank you, Maurice.
Castle : The last time I was here, I brought this Parisian supermodel,
Castle : so he thought...
Castle : It's not important. Would you like to choose your room?
Beckett : No. I'd like to start the investigation.
Castle : We haven't even ordered room service yet.
Beckett : Castle, I'm not here for room service, I'm here for justice.
UNK: Wow.
