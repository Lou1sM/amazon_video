Castle : So I'm having Alex meet me at the precinct later on today.
Martha : Beckett will be thrilled with that.
Castle : Beckett, I'm sure she won't mind.
Alexis : You haven't told her yet?
UNK: I'm sure she will be fine with it.
Castle : Fine with it? Why would I be fine with it?
Castle : Okay. I'm sorry.
Castle : Come on, he's a writer.
Castle : How much trouble could he possibly be?
Castle : So, is that a yes?
Castle : Is that a no?
Beckett : Hey, Lanie.
Beckett : - Hey. - Who's this?
Lanie : Zack Lindsey. A standout on the UNY swim team.
Lanie : Or he was, before he drowned.
Castle : How does a champion swimmer drown?
Lanie : He had help.
Beckett : - Burns? - From a caustic substance.
Lanie : Someone put a rag to his face soaked in the stuff.
Lanie : He passed out from the fumes, then was dumped in the pool to drown.
Lanie : Based on water and body temp,
UNK: I'd say between 1 : 00 and 5 : 00 this morning.
Beckett : And what was the substance?
Lanie : I won't know till I get him back to the shop.
Beckett : Who found him?
Ryan : Zack's teammates, when they showed up for 6 : 00 a.m. swim practice.
UNK: All right, let's talk to his teammates,
Beckett : find out if anyone had it in for Zack
Beckett : and let's figure out where they were between 1 : 00 and 5 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : I'll go talk to Zack's coach.
UNK: Coach Rome : It just doesn't seem real, seeing him lying there like that.
Castle : What was he doing here so late?
UNK: Training.
UNK: Coach Rome : Couldn't keep that kid out of the pool.
UNK: Coach Rome : Two weeks ago, he got food poisoning right before a meet.
UNK: Coach Rome : Sick as a dog, just puking his guts out.
UNK: Coach Rome : I told him to withdraw,
UNK: Coach Rome : but he toughed it out, won all his events.
UNK: Coach Rome : That was Zack.
UNK: He was going to be the next Rob Tredwyck or Michael Phelps.
Beckett : Did he have any personal problems?
UNK: Coach Rome : He was a kid from Bensonhurst, you know.
