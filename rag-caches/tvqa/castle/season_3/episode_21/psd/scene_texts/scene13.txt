UNK: We don't know that he's a killer.
Castle : Is this the face of an innocent man?
Castle : He had a heated argument with our victim the night before he was killed.
Beckett : And what would his motive be, exactly?
UNK: He...
Esposito : I may have a line on that.
Esposito : I'm looking at Zack's financials.
Esposito : The guy only had a partial scholarship.
Esposito : He still paid for most of his tuition, books and living expenses,
Esposito : all without taking student loans.
Esposito : He didn't have a job and his mom was just squeaking by.
Castle : And NCAA rules preclude him
Castle : from receiving any financial assistance from outside his family.
Esposito : So, where did he get that money?
Castle : You think maybe he borrowed money from the wrong guys
Castle : to finance his dream?
Esposito : And when he couldn't make the payments, they came after him.
Castle : That would explain the argument.
UNK: Esposito.
Beckett : We don't even know that there is an argument,
Beckett : and the only evidence we have
Beckett : is a sketch of a man that Bridget claims she saw.
UNK: All right. Thanks.
UNK: Uniforms just got to Zack's place.
UNK: Looks like it's been tossed.
Castle : This place looks like my first apartment.
Castle : We used to have cockroach races.
UNK: I wonder if that's how Kafka got the idea.
