UNK: Tommy Marcone : You're wasting your time.
Castle : You ever see this man?
UNK: Tommy Marcone : No, and your watch is too expensive for a cop's.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : So, Detective, who's this guy?
UNK: He's the guy buying a round for the house.
Beckett : Tommy, if you know something, you should talk.
Castle : Hey, everybody, a round for the house, in memory of Zack Lindsey.
Bartender : Zack was a great kid.
Bartender : Everybody around here loved him. Tommy included.
Castle : Grand theft auto, conspiracy to sell stolen vehicles,
Esposito : assault, assault with a deadly weapon.
Esposito : He immigrated to the US when he was 28.
UNK: But he was born Janusz Lenadovsky in Minsk, Belarus.
Castle : Belarus. I knew it! That's right next to Lithuania.
Esposito : Says here that he owns an auto repair shop on Avenue U.
Esposito : Watch your backs on this one. This guy's dangerous.
UNK: There.
Esposito : Jimmy Lennon.
Ryan : NYPD... Hey!
UNK: Hey!
Ryan : Hey, hey! NYPD!
UNK: This is clean business. I fix these cars.
Beckett : Really? I bet the people who own them would be surprised to hear that.
Beckett : Now, I want to know about Zack Lindsey.
UNK: Jimmy Lennon : I know nothing.
Beckett : Not the best three words to have fallen out of your mouth, Jimmy.
Castle : I was half expecting "moose and squirrel."
Beckett : You're going to jail. How long depends on you.
UNK: Jimmy Lennon : Jail in your country is vacation.
Beckett : Then I will make it very difficult.
Beckett : Here's what I think. I think that Zack stole cars for you,
Beckett : but he had bigger plans and he told you he wanted out.
Beckett : You were worried he couldn't keep his mouth shut.
Beckett : So you threatened him and told him, "There's no walking out of this."
