Castle : Those steroids we found at Zack's apartment?
Castle : That he wasn't taking?
UNK: Maybe they're Brian's.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : Why you got me in here? I didn't do nothing wrong.
UNK: No?
Beckett : Zack's rival on the swim team, Brian Morris,
Beckett : we found his Stingray at the chop shop.
Beckett : The one you stole.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : I don't even know what that means.
Beckett : Zack's prints were on it and so were yours.
Beckett : So stop playing around.
Castle : Why did you boost the car?
UNK: Tommy Marcone : Because Brian Morris is a silver-spoon-licking punk.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : He hated Zack for being a better swimmer.
UNK: Two weeks ago, he spiked Zack's pregame meal to make him sick.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : Zack won the meet anyway.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : Didn't take him long to figure out it was Brian, though.
Castle : So, you took the car out of revenge?
UNK: "Swim for gold"? Vanity plates? I mean, can you get any more douchey?
UNK: Tommy Marcone : Brian's up in Greenwich with his own training pool,
UNK: Tommy Marcone : private coaches, whatever he needs.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : Meanwhile, Zack's stuck here boosting cars just so he can eat,
