UNK: Tommy Marcone : You never want more than you bargained for.

UNK: Tommy Marcone : He knew right then and there Brian was juicing.
Beckett : Did Zack have any plans for this information?
UNK: Well, he hadn't figured that out yet. Kind of a big deal, you know?
UNK: Tommy Marcone : I told him he should turn that cheating bastard Brian in,
UNK: get his ass banned.
Castle : Guess he never got the chance.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : I guess not.
Beckett : Zack was supposed to be your friend, Tommy.
Beckett : Why didn't you tell us this from the start?
UNK: Tommy Marcone : I don't know. Maybe I was scared.
UNK: All right, stick around, we're not done with you.
Beckett : You recognize this, Brian?
UNK: If it's going to be adversarial from the outset...

Castle : Me neither.
UNK: Seems Alex Conrad feels the same way.
