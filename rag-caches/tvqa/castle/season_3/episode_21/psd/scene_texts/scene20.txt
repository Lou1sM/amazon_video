Beckett : you followed him to the pool and you killed him.
Beckett : Is there anything you want to add to that?

UNK: "Swim for gold."

Castle : There's a car over there with the license plate "Swim for gold."
UNK: Whoa!

UNK: Coach Rome : Brian Morris.
Castle : That's one of Zack's teammates. It's his main rival.

Castle : I don't know. But I know why it gave Brian a motive for murder.
