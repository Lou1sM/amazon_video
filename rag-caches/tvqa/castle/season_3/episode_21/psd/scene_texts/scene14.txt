Beckett : Zack was killed and then his place gets trashed.
Beckett : Not a coincidence.

Beckett : Then why'd they leave the TV and the laptop?
Castle : Or the medical supplies.
Castle : Dental pick.
Castle : You think plaque slows you down in the water?
Beckett : They were looking for something specific.
Beckett : You don't rip through a mattress unless you've run out of places to look.

Castle : Maybe it's still here and it was just too well-hidden.
UNK: What?

Castle : Maybe he's not as clean as we thought.
UNK: Yep. It's steroids, all right.
Beckett : I thought you said Zack wasn't using steroids.
UNK: - The test wouldn't pick up stuff like this. - Why not?

UNK: "Virtually undetectable."
Castle : Where does a drug like that come from?
Lanie : There's been some talk about a new
Lanie : "beat the test" performance-enhancing drug
Lanie : being developed somewhere in Eastern Europe.
