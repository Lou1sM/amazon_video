UNK: Hey, since we closed the case,
UNK: we figured we'd take Conrad on a little field trip up to Rikers.
UNK: Alex Conrad : and I want to get all the facts right.
Castle : Will you still send me your writer's draft?
UNK: Yes, soon as I change the killer.
UNK: Girlfriend?
UNK: Alex Conrad : Rookie mistake.
Beckett : Let's go.
UNK: - It was nice to meet you, Alex. - You too.
Castle : Come on.
UNK: So, a dude can be a muse, right, bro?
Esposito : I mean, it's not weird or anything, is it?
Castle : - No, it's not weird. - No.
UNK: No, yeah.
Castle : - That's a little weird. - Yeah.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Always.
