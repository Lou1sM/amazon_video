Castle : he had given to you.
Beckett : And you knew that if Zack talked, you would be found out.
Castle : They'd erase your name from the record books,
Castle : they'd take away all your medals.
Castle : You would lose everything.
UNK: And there was no way you were gonna let that happen.
Beckett : Turn around.
Beckett : Take a long look, Rob.
Beckett : Where you're going, I don't think they have pools.
Beckett : Let's go.
Castle : You know, it is ironic, the one man Zack thought he could trust, his mentor,
Castle : turned out to be his killer.
UNK: Yes, speaking of mentor,
Beckett : I heard that you guys were pretty hard on Conrad last night.
Castle : Hard on him?
UNK: No, no, that was just a little friendly hazing.
Beckett : To hear him describe it,
Beckett : it sounds like someone was trying to teach him a lesson.
Castle : What? Why would I want to do that?
Beckett : Because you didn't want him to spend time with me.
Castle : - That is completely... - True?
Castle : Yes, fine. It's true. I'm jealous.
Castle : There, I said it.
Castle : I want you all to myself,
Castle : and to have you spending time with another writer, that upsets me,
UNK: and if that makes me petty, so be it.
Castle : Guilty as charged.
Beckett : Actually, I kind of think it's sweet.
