UNK: Tommy Marcone : I never meant for anyone to get hurt.
UNK: Tommy Marcone : I'd like that phone call now.
Beckett : Okay, so, Zack stole Brian's stash,
Beckett : and because of Tommy,
Beckett : Brian thought that Zack was blackmailing him.
Beckett : Brian's motive just keeps getting stronger and stronger.
Castle : Almost like it's on steroids.
UNK: - Miss DiNovi. - Tommy Marcone called.
UNK: He said you had him in here. He said Brian Morris killed my son.
Montgomery : We don't know all that. We just know he's a person of interest.
UNK: Lorraine Dinovi : So, why didn't you arrest him?
Montgomery : We don't have enough to hold him.
UNK: Lorraine Dinovi : And he's the son of a millionaire. I bet that doesn't hurt either.
Montgomery : Around here, it's about the evidence, not how fat someone's wallet is.
UNK: Lorraine Dinovi : Yeah, well, I live in the real world.
UNK: Lorraine Dinovi : And I know that boy's family
UNK: Lorraine Dinovi : and they're gonna do whatever it takes to protect him, because they can.
UNK: Lorraine Dinovi : Captain, Zack's all I had.
Beckett : We can't figure out if Brian is connected to the murder
Beckett : until we find the real killer.
UNK: Then you're going to have to dig deeper.
Montgomery : If Brian and his family are involved, then there's gotta be a connection,
Montgomery : and I want it found.
UNK: All right, great, thank you.
