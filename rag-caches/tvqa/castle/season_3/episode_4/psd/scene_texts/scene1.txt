Alexis : - Are there marshmallows in this? - Yes.
Alexis : - And chocolate? - Yes.
Castle : That's the point. It's a s'more-let.
UNK: Uh.
Alexis : I gotta go. Love you! Love you!
Martha : Bye, honey.
UNK: Mmm!
Castle : This is almost as good as my chocolate mousse chimichanga.
UNK: Ah-ha! I knew you'd reconsider! It's kind of like David Hasselhoff.
Castle : At first you're repulsed, but then strangely, you're drawn in.
Alexis : No, still repulsed. Bye!
Castle : What's up with Alexis? She seems a little out of it.
Martha : Isn't it obvious?
Castle : - What? - Oh, she's in love.
UNK: Alexis?
Martha : Oh, come on, darling.
Martha : In case you haven't noticed, she's not a little girl anymore.
Castle : Thank you, Mother. I think if Alexis were in love, she would've told me.
UNK: Uh-uh. The fact that she hasn't told you, is how we know it's real.
Castle : - Mother? - Okay.
UNK: And the fact that she mentioned it to me last night.
UNK: Who is he? Where did she meet him?
Martha : I don't know! She wouldn't say.
Martha : No! Diva's honor, she didn't tell me anything.
Martha : She didn't even tell me his name.
Castle : I can't believe she told you and not me.
Castle : I'm supposed to be her go-to guy.
Martha : Oh, darling! Of course, you are! It's just, you know, it's first love.
