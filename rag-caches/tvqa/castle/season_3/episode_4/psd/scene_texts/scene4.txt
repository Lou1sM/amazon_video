UNK: when he was shot and killed.
Beckett : So what was this guy doing out here practically naked at midnight?
Lanie : Don't bother with any of your perverted theories, Castle.
Lanie : I found fibers in the bullet hole.
Beckett : Which means he was wearing clothes when he was shot.
Castle : That doesn't make any sense.
Castle : The killer shot him, and then hung around
Castle : to take his bloody clothes off him?
Beckett : Well, maybe the killer was worried
Beckett : that there was forensic evidence on the clothes that would connect them.
UNK: Javier Esposito : Yo, Uni found this wallet out in a garbage can near Fifth.
Ryan : Photo on the license matches Captain Underpants here.
Ryan : Sorry, my nephew loves those books.
Beckett : Daniel Goldstein, 25.
Beckett : Lives in SoHo.
Esposito : Yeah, he's also got a work ID for Berman Rose down on Wall Street.
Castle : So he lived downtown and he worked downtown.
Castle : What was he doing way up here?
Beckett : - Let's take this down to the lab. - Right.
Castle : So, I wear boxers. What do you wear?
UNK: Thongs? Cheekies?
Castle : I told you mine.
Castle : Bloomers? Granny panties?
UNK: Commando?
Rachel : His clothes were taken?
Rachel : Why would anyone take his clothes?
UNK: We don't know, Miss Goldstein.
Beckett : Can you tell us what your brother might have been doing in the park?
Rachel : That late? I have no idea.
Beckett : Well, the place where Daniel was found is known for drug activity.
Beckett : Was he using?
Rachel : No, he barely even drank.
Beckett : Did he have any enemies or conflicts that you know of?
Rachel : No, no. Look, none of this makes any sense.
UNK: It's just, it's not like him.
Rachel : Our parents both died in a car accident when he was 12,
Rachel : and since then, he's always been so cautious.
Castle : What about dating? Was there anyone special in his life?
UNK: He wished, but no.
Rachel : He barely had a social life, or social skills.
