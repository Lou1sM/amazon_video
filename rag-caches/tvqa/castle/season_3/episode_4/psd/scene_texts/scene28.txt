Adam : God, no!
Castle : Dude. What happened?
Beckett : - Esposito! - No. I don't want to hear it.
Esposito : No. I'm okay.
UNK: Hey!
Epsosito : No, I really am fine, bro.
Epsosito : - We got this stuff from storage. - You should have seen your faces!
UNK: Captain, you really sold that.
UNK: "Speaking of tragedy, did you hear about Detective Esposito?"
Castle : - Hey. - Sir.
Castle : - That was good. - I'm not really that fine.
UNK: - Oh, yeah, let me just... Sorry. - Neck brace, please. Neck brace.
UNK: - Just lock it down, lock it. - Yeah, yeah.
UNK: Kate!
Beckett : Josh. What are you doing here?
UNK: Oh, I got your text.
Beckett : You mean the text where I said I was gonna pick you up?
Josh : Yeah, I was nearby.
UNK: Well, Josh, this Captain Montgomery, Richard Castle,
Beckett : Detectives Esposito and Ryan.
Josh : - Hey, boys. Boys?
Josh : - Catch any bad guys today? - Every day.
Josh : - You all set? - Yeah. Let me just get my stuff.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: So, you and Beckett?
UNK: Mmm. What about us?
Castle : You tell me.
Josh : You're the writer!
UNK: Yeah!
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : And you are?
Josh : Kate hasn't told you about me, has she?
Castle : What's to tell?
Beckett : Hey, you ready to go?
