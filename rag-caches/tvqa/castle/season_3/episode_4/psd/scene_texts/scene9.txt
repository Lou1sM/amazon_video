Abe : You'll need to find the actual pistol to match it to this lead ball.
Beckett : And how many people would own that kind of antique pistol?
Abe : Hard to say.
Abe : They're considered collectibles, so they don't have to be registered.
Castle : Making it pretty smart to kill someone with one.
Abe : Oh, yeah. Guns may be old,
UNK: but they got plenty of killing left in 'em.
Beckett : I'm afraid not.
Esposito : What? Why did he go all Hulk Hogan on me?
Castle : Well, why did the scorpion sting the frog? It's his nature.
UNK: Captain Roy Montgomery : from behind bars from now on for assaulting an officer
UNK: Captain Roy Montgomery : I'll see he gets the max, Detective.
Esposito : Thank you, Captain.
Montgomery : You know, you can take a couple days if you like? Catch some movies.
Esposito : No need, sir.
Ryan : Still no luck with the clothes.
UNK: Unis looked in every garbage can
Ryan : within a five block radius of the park.
Beckett : What is so special about these clothes
Beckett : that our killer would take them?
UNK: Maybe the killer came through the time ripple naked
Castle : and needed the clothes.
Beckett : Sadly, I don't have a better theory at this point.
UNK: So, the question is,
Beckett : what did a Wall Street number-cruncher like Goldstein
Beckett : get himself into?
Beckett : Castle and I'll go to his firm.
Beckett : You guys see if you can track down any antique gun enthusiasts
Beckett : on social media sites or local clubs.
Beckett : Maybe someone from Goldstein's life'll pop.
Ryan : You got it.
Beckett : You know, I just don't get how someone could shoot Goldstein,
Beckett : steal his clothes, and then not hang onto his wallet.
Beckett : Just doesn't make any sense.
UNK: No.
Beckett : Maybe giant moths killed him and ate his clothes.
