Beckett : Adam Murphy didn't kill Goldstein.
Castle : But he confessed.
Beckett : And I believe that he believes he did it. But he didn't.
Castle : Do tell.
Beckett : It bothered me that we couldn't hit the target at the shooting range.
Beckett : And so I ran ballistics on the dueling pistols.
Beckett : The bullet that hit Daniel Goldstein didn't match either one of them.
Beckett : Adam couldn't have killed him.
UNK: You're talking full-on, grassy knoll, conspiracy theory?
Beckett : Not theory. Fact.
Beckett : There was a third shooter and that's our killer.
Ryan : Hey, Beckett!
Beckett : Did you find Adam Murphy's bullet?
Abe : Lead ball.
UNK: Yup! He didn't kill Goldstein, but he did kill Squirrelstein.
Ryan : What are the odds, huh?
