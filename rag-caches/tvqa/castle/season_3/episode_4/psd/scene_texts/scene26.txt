UNK: Oh, no! They took his clothes, too!
Beckett : Could you?
UNK: Aw! - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
UNK: Okay, so we know that Goldstein was standing right over here.
Castle : Facing Adam, who's right over there.
UNK: Right.
Beckett : And if our killer wanted to shoot him without either of them seeing him,
Beckett : he would be standing right over...
Beckett : There, by that clump of trees.
UNK: Detective, I've got clothing fibers.
Beckett : This thread look familiar?
Castle : Oh, I'd recognize that burgundy velvet anywhere.
UNK: Kind of says "steampunk," doesn't it?
Castle : Matter of fact, I think I know the murder weapon.
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Couldn't stay away, huh? Can I get you guys something?
Beckett : Sure, Troy.
Beckett : We're looking for a shooter.
Castle : Actually, I think we already found one.
Castle : Nice uniform, by the way.
Beckett : We found your father's shotgun.
UNK: We know that you modified it
Beckett : in order to shoot antique lead ball bullets.
Troy : What are you talking about? Adam Murphy already confessed, right?
Castle : Turns out Adam Murphy couldn't have done it.
Castle : It's a sciencey, ballistics thing.
Beckett : It was pretty clever firing your father's shotgun
Beckett : at the exact moment that Adam and Goldstein fired their guns.
Castle : Making Adam believe that he was the one that killed Goldstein,
UNK: right as the church bells chimed midnight.
Castle : Isn't that right?
Troy : Seeing him in here every night in that ridiculous outfit,
Troy : just throwing around all that money.
Troy : Why should he get to live like that when my dad's dead?
Beckett : Knowing that our shooter was a staff member at the club
