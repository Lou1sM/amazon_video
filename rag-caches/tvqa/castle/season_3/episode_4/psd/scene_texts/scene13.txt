Castle : You tell me.
Alexis : Dad, the only reason I invited Ashley over tonight
UNK: was so you could meet him.
Castle : Yes, well me meeting Ashley
Castle : has smeared the lip gloss all over your face.
Epsosito : I really should be going.
Alexis : You can stay, Ashley.
Castle : Oh, the gun.
Castle : My bad.
Castle : Please, Ashley, stay.
Castle : - You can check out the gun. - No, thanks.
Alexis : Call me later?
Ashley : Yeah. If it's okay with your gun?
UNK: Dad.
Castle : Yeah, it's okay with me.
Martha : Thank you.
Ashley : And I just want you to know how much I respect Alexis.
Ashley : I mean, you don't have to worry about issues of respect.
Ashley : She's probably the most respectable person I know.
Ashley : And I respect you, too.
Castle : It's good to know that.
Martha : Thank you.
