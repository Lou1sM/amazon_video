Alexis : How do you know when you're in love?
Alexis : I know it's an emotion, a feeling, and you can't exactly define.
Alexis : Like, technically, how you know when you're feeling it,
Alexis : but since I've never felt it before,
Alexis : how do I know what I'm feeling is even it at all?
Alexis : Except, of course, for the fact that
Alexis : I'm feeling all these things I've never felt before.
UNK: Like in my stomach and my throat and even kind of in my ears.
Alexis : I mean, which just has to mean that it's love, right?
Alexis : Considering I only feel them when I'm with Ashley
Alexis : or thinking about him?
UNK: I mean, that's gotta be love, right?
Alexis : 'Cause I'm feeling all these things I've read about in poems
Alexis : and heard about in songs but never completely understood.
Alexis : But now I do!
Beckett : I understand, and I'm listening to all this music
Alexis : and reading all this poetry in a completely new and glorious light,
Alexis : which I just think has to mean that it's love. What do you think?
Alexis : I can't stop thinking about him, Daddy. I don't even want to
UNK: because he's just the greatest, sweetest, most adorable guy
Alexis : and his nose crinkles when he laughs and I'm just so happy.
