Castle : - Who dares besmirch... - God! Don't shoot!
UNK: ...my honor... It's okay, Ashley.
Alexis : He's not going to shoot you. What the heck, Dad?
Castle : I might be asking you the same...
Castle : Ashley? This is Ashley?
Alexis : Ash, this is my dad, Rick.
Alexis : And I have no idea why he's waving a gun.
Ashley : So nice to meet you, Mr. Castle.
Castle : You too, Ashley.
Castle : And I have a perfectly good reason why I'm waving a gun.
Ryan : Excuse us.
Alexis : Explain yourself.
Castle : I got this gun for research for a case.
Castle : Which you might know if you had checked in with me today.
Alexis : What's that supposed to mean?
UNK: Let's just say one of us has nothing to hide.
Castle : Perhaps you'd like to explain yourself?
