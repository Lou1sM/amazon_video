Beckett : We found your father's shotgun.
UNK: We know that you modified it
Beckett : in order to shoot antique lead ball bullets.
Troy : What are you talking about? Adam Murphy already confessed, right?
Castle : Turns out Adam Murphy couldn't have done it.
Castle : It's a sciencey, ballistics thing.
Beckett : It was pretty clever firing your father's shotgun
Beckett : at the exact moment that Adam and Goldstein fired their guns.
Castle : Making Adam believe that he was the one that killed Goldstein,
UNK: right as the church bells chimed midnight.
Castle : Isn't that right?
Troy : Seeing him in here every night in that ridiculous outfit,
Troy : just throwing around all that money.
Troy : Why should he get to live like that when my dad's dead?
Beckett : Knowing that our shooter was a staff member at the club
UNK: led us straight back to Troy.
Castle : He overheard Goldstein and Murphy planning the duel
Castle : and took his opportunity.
Beckett : And then Troy's alibi fell apart
Beckett : as soon as we started interviewing other staff members
Beckett : who couldn't remember seeing him there
Beckett : half an hour before or after the duel.
Montgomery : Dueling over a girl. Avenging the death of a loved one.
Castle : Cuts to the heart of romance.
Beckett : And the tragedy.
Montgomery : Speaking of tragedy, did you hear about Detective Esposito?
Beckett : No, what about him?
UNK: Oh!
UNK: He...
UNK: Oh!
Adam : God, no!
Castle : Dude. What happened?
Beckett : - Esposito! - No. I don't want to hear it.
Esposito : No. I'm okay.
UNK: Hey!
Epsosito : No, I really am fine, bro.
Epsosito : - We got this stuff from storage. - You should have seen your faces!
UNK: Captain, you really sold that.
UNK: "Speaking of tragedy, did you hear about Detective Esposito?"
Castle : - Hey. - Sir.
Castle : - That was good. - I'm not really that fine.
UNK: - Oh, yeah, let me just... Sorry. - Neck brace, please. Neck brace.
UNK: - Just lock it down, lock it. - Yeah, yeah.
UNK: Kate!
Beckett : Josh. What are you doing here?
UNK: Oh, I got your text.
Beckett : You mean the text where I said I was gonna pick you up?
Josh : Yeah, I was nearby.
UNK: Well, Josh, this Captain Montgomery, Richard Castle,
Beckett : Detectives Esposito and Ryan.
Josh : - Hey, boys. Boys?
Josh : - Catch any bad guys today? - Every day.
Josh : - You all set? - Yeah. Let me just get my stuff.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: So, you and Beckett?
UNK: Mmm. What about us?
Castle : You tell me.
Josh : You're the writer!
UNK: Yeah!
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : And you are?
Josh : Kate hasn't told you about me, has she?
Castle : What's to tell?
Beckett : Hey, you ready to go?
UNK: Yeah. I'll see you around.
Beckett : Bye, guys.
UNK: Later.
Martha : Just you?
UNK: Yes.
Alexis : Thanks for that talk last night. I feel so much better.
UNK: Hey, you can always talk to me.
Castle : Or at me.
UNK: Yeah.
Alexis : Being in love is exhausting.
Castle : Yeah, you got that right.
Alexis : You okay, Dad?
Alexis : You seem distracted.
Troy : What are you talking about? You have my undivided attention.
Alexis : Good. Because I want to go on a date tonight.
Alexis : How's that sound?
Castle : Of course.
Castle : Great! Have a good time!
Alexis : I meant with you, Dad.
Alexis : You'll always be my go-to guy.
Castle : Did Gram put you up to this?
Rachel : I have no idea what you're talking about.
Castle : Pity date. I'll take it.
Castle : You're a terrible liar.
