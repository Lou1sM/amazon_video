Castle : Look, maybe Damian is a cheater
Castle : and a bum and a bad husband.
UNK: Maybe?
UNK: But that doesn't make him a killer.
Castle : And you keep looking at me like I'm crazy for believing in him,
Castle : but that's just because you don't know him.
Beckett : Castle, neither do you.
Beckett : The Damian that you think you know doesn't exist.
Beckett : You made him up. Just like you made up Derrick Storm.
Beckett : Just like you made up Nikki Heat.
Beckett : He's a character in a story that you told yourself
Beckett : when you were a homesick 14-year-old little boy.
