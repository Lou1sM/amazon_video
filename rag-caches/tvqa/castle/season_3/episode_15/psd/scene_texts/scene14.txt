Beckett : And he rented a playroom at the Varick Club at least once a week.
Ryan : What's in a playroom?
Castle : Not much more than a bed.
UNK: Yes, I'm a member.
Ryan : So, why would Damian rent a bed when he had a nice big townhouse?
Castle : There's got to be a reasonable explanation.
Beckett : Well, let's go see if we can find it.
UNK: Callie Langston : Mr. Castle, welcome back. It's been a long time.
Castle : Yes, well, I've been working a lot. No time for play.

Beckett : Apparently he would come here often, rent a playroom.
UNK: Callie Langston : I should probably get my supervisor...
Castle : Callie, it's okay, you can tell us.
Castle : Was Damian meeting someone here?
UNK: Callie Langston : We're not supposed to get involved with members.
UNK: Callie Langston : Especially married members,
UNK: Callie Langston : but Damian...
UNK: Callie Langston : We couldn't help it.
UNK: Callie Langston : We fell in love.
Beckett : Did he tell you that he planned on leaving his wife?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : Did he tell you about the problems with the money?
UNK: Callie Langston : No. Mrs. Westlake did.
Castle : You spoke to Mrs. Westlake?
UNK: Callie Langston : She came to the club Wednesday morning.
UNK: Callie Langston : She said that she had figured it out about Damian and me,
