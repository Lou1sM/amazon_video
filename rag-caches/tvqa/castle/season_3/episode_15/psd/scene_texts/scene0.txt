Ryan : I'm just saying,
UNK: the first Valentine's Day you spend with somebody is important.
Esposito : Yeah, but Lanie doesn't care about that stuff.
UNK: All women care.
UNK: Beckett, you and Josh, you got big plans for Valentine's Day, right?
Beckett : Josh is a surgeon, I'm a cop.
Beckett : In the unlikely event that we have a couple of hours free on Monday night,
Beckett : we might go to dinner.
UNK: See?
UNK: Hey, Castle, it's Beckett. Call me when you get this.
Esposito : Ooh! Castle's gonna be sorry that he missed this one.
UNK: Why?
Esposito : Rich people, man. Society murders are always the freakiest.
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : The owner of the house, Damian Westlake,
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : says all was well when he left at 5 : 00 p.m. to meet his neighbor,
UNK: Charles Utley, for a game of pick-up.
UNK: When the men returned at 6 : 00 p.m.,
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : Victoria Westlake was dead.
Beckett : Murder weapon?
Beckett : Nail gun.
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : It's over there.
Esposito : See? Told you.
UNK: Freaky.
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : The back door was ajar.
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : Officers found what appears to be a gang tag
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : on the rear wall of the building.
UNK: Officer Greta Bailey : The paint's fresh.
Esposito : I'll reach out to the gang unit, see if they can ID it for us.
Ryan : And I'll talk with Mr. Utley.
Beckett : Westlakes have a dog.
Beckett : So if neighbors heard barking, we might be able to pinpoint a timeline.
UNK: We've canvassed, and nobody heard the dog.
UNK: The ME tentatively puts time of death between 4 : 30 and 6 : 00.
UNK: 4 : 30. Which means she might have been dead
UNK: before the husband left the house.
UNK: Where is Mr. Westlake?
