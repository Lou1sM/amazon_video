Castle : Thank you, Blanca.
Ryan : So, Vicky was alive after Damian left the house.
Esposito : And he was with Charles Utley until they came back and found her dead.
Castle : Which means...
Beckett : Damian couldn't have killed her.
UNK: Got it. The DA's office just kicked Damian Westlake loose.
Montgomery : And they weren't too happy about it, either.
Beckett : Sir, if Westlake didn't kill his wife,
Beckett : then he hired someone else to do it for him.
Beckett : Just like he did the last time.
Castle : Wasn't it you that said that bad guys always bring their own weapons?
Beckett : Not when they're trying to make it look like a push-in robbery gone wrong.
Castle : What about the dog that didn't bark?
Beckett : He got the dog used to the guy.
Castle : Come on! You just can't get over the fact
Castle : that Damian was a person of interest in his father's murder.
Beckett : I won't ignore the fact that there is a pattern here.
Beckett : People close to this guy seem to die violently.
UNK: Or maybe someone is using Damian's tragic past
Castle : to frame him for Vicky's murder now.
Castle : There's another suspect right in front of you
