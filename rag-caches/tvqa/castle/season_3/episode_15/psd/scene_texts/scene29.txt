UNK: Damian Westlake : Detective Beckett.
Beckett : Can we talk for a moment?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Have you come to apologize?
UNK: No.
UNK: Damian Westlake : At least you're honest. What can I do for you, Detective?
Beckett : You could show me the diamonds that you stole from Vicky.
Beckett : I spoke to Wallace Benner, the jeweler on the West Side.
Beckett : He said that he replaced your wife's diamonds with imitation ones.
Beckett : Over a period of several weeks, he exchanged 26 diamonds,
UNK: worth over $8 million, and gave you the real ones.
UNK: Damian Westlake : But doesn't this argue against your theory that I killed my wife?
