UNK: Oh, and he's got a little valentine of his own, doesn't he?
Esposito : Is that Amber Patinelli? Vicky Westlake's employee?
UNK: And you're sure it's her?
Beckett : So much for Simon saying that he wanted to reconcile with Vicky.
UNK: What do you want us to do?
UNK: Thought so. Let's bring them both in.
Castle : I was hoping you'd still be here.
Beckett : I was just about to call you.
UNK: Castle/beckett : - I think I know who the killer is. - I think I know who the killer is.
Beckett : I appreciate you coming in.
UNK: Simon Campbell : Detective, it's very late.
Beckett : This'll be quick. I didn't realize that the two of you were a couple.
UNK: Simon Campbell : Well, it's very casual.
UNK: Amber Patinelli : For a long time, we were just friends.
UNK: Amber Patinelli : I was a shoulder to cry on after the divorce.
UNK: Amber Patinelli : It's only been recently that...
Beckett : Any plans for Valentine's Day?
UNK: I had nothing special, no.
Castle : You were hoping to spend it with Vicky, right?
UNK: Amber Patinelli : What does that mean?
UNK: Simon?
UNK: Simon Campbell : Vicky and I have been talking, that's all.
UNK: Simon Campbell : How is this relevant to anything, Detective?
Beckett : Did Vicky know about you and Amber?
UNK: Simon Campbell : No. I didn't want her to know.
Castle : So it's possible that Vicky innocently confided in her friend, Amber,
Castle : telling her she was leaving Damian and going back to Simon.
Castle : Not knowing that he was your Simon now.
Beckett : Amber, you called for a company car at 4 : 15 on Wednesday afternoon.
Beckett : We just talked to the dispatcher.
Beckett : He says you ordered a sedan and kept it for an hour.
Beckett : A round trip to the Westlakes' and back.
Beckett : We found a nail gun with fingerprints that we couldn't identify.
Beckett : If we compare them to yours, do you think we'd find a match?
