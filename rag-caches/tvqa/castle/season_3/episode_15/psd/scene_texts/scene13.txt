UNK: Damian Westlake : "Have a good game."
Castle : They had a fight. Married people fight.
Beckett : Well, then why did Damian lie to us about it?
UNK: Maybe he was afraid you'd, I don't know, suspect him of murder.
Beckett : Or maybe he was afraid that we'd figure out what the fight was about.
Beckett : These are Damian's credit card charges.
Castle : Yeah, we went over those. Cigars, scotch, box seats.
Ryan : This is a different card. Took us a while to find it
Ryan : because Damian paid the bill from a pocket account
Ryan : and he kept it a secret from Vicky.
Beckett : And given the charges, I'm sure he's keeping other secrets.
Beckett : There's a florist. Some jewelry store at the mall.
