Ryan : He said Damian was distraught when he found his wife's body.
Ryan : But he also says that during their normally friendly game,

Esposito : So maybe he shoots his wife, then goes shoot some hoops,
Esposito : injures his friend, brings him inside to establish an alibi.
Castle : Vicky Westlake had an argument with one of her workers on Friday.
Castle : A worker who, and I'm just speculating here,
Castle : may have some experience with nail guns.
Castle : Maybe we should go run check out that lead
Castle : before we rush to judgment on an innocent man.
Beckett : I'm sorry, is this you staying out of the way?
Castle : This is me simply making a point about remaining objective.
UNK: Damian Westlake : Excuse me, Amber Patinelli?
