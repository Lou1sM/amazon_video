Blanca : I was delivering the mail on Wednesday afternoon.
UNK: As I made my way up 69th towards Park,
UNK: I passed Mr. Westlake and Mr. Utley.
UNK: I said "hello." They said "hello" back.
Blanca : A couple of minutes later, I get to the Westlakes' residence.
Blanca : The door opens, and Mrs. Westlake comes running out
Blanca : and hands me a large manila envelope.
Blanca : She said she wanted to make sure it went out in that day's mail.
Beckett : Wait a minute. So, you're positive
Beckett : that you saw Mrs. Westlake after you saw Damian?
Blanca : Lady, I couldn't be more sure. Anything else?
Castle : No, that's it. Thank you.
Blanca : - Then I'm leaving now. - Of course.
