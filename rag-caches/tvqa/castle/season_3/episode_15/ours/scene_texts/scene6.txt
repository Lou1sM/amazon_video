Martha : and she's feeling the pressure.
UNK: Oh, yes. She wants a gift that says, "I love you,"
Castle : but nothing that says,
Castle : "I love you more than life itself, please don't leave me or I may die."
Martha : Well, that's why you guys go for the chocolates and the flowers.
Castle : I wish the choice I had to make today was so simple.
UNK: I realize that I have the choice to believe in two terrible things.
Castle : Either Damian is a killer, or Beckett's arrested an innocent man.
Castle : Just thinking about it is making my head hurt.
Martha : Well, then, forget your head. Listen to your heart.
