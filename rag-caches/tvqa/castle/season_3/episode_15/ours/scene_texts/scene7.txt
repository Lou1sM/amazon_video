UNK: Ricky.
Castle : I keep thinking back to when I was a senior and you were off at Harvard.
Castle : You'd send me pages you were working on for your novel.
Castle : And they were good, Damian. And you had talent.
UNK: Why did you throw it away?
UNK: Damian Westlake : You were the writer, Ricky, not me. I didn't have anything to say.
UNK: Damian Westlake : After I inherited all that money, I just didn't even want to try anymore.
UNK: Damian Westlake : But when I look back at my life, I hope you won't mind
UNK: Damian Westlake : if I list you as one of my few accomplishments.
UNK: You should have told me about Callie.
UNK: Damian Westlake : I swear to you, I didn't kill my wife.
UNK: All right, can you think of anything we might have overlooked?
Castle : Anything that might speak to your innocence?
UNK: Damian Westlake : I slept in. I went to the gym.
UNK: Damian Westlake : When I got home Vicky was already there.
UNK: Damian Westlake : She had been to see Callie. We fought, God, for hours.
Castle : She said she wanted a divorce.
UNK: Yeah, she showed me an envelope and said there were papers inside
UNK: that her lawyer had drawn up for her to sign.
UNK: Damian Westlake : She was gonna end the marriage.
UNK: Damian Westlake : I begged her to reconsider and she asked me to leave.
UNK: Damian Westlake : She needed to think.
UNK: You said Vicky gave you an envelope. What'd it look like?
Blanca : I gotta get back to my route.
