UNK: Richard Castle : Oh. Science project?
Alexis : No, it's a pet.
Alexis : Say hello to Theodore, Dad. I'm rat-sitting him for Ashley.
Castle : Hello, Theodore.
Castle : How goes the rat race?
UNK: Did you know the average life span of a rat is two to three years?
UNK: Ashley's had Theodore for five
Alexis : and this is the first time he's left him with anyone.
Castle : Trusting you with a treasured pet?
Castle : That's a big step in a relationship.
Alexis : Yeah. I guess it kind of is.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : I must say,
UNK: the little plague-pusher is not very diligent about his exercise.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : I don't know why, I think it's just those beady little eyes.
Castle : It's a rat, Mother. They all have beady eyes.
Castle : That's where the phrase comes from.
Alexis : Dad! Those are for Theodore!
Alexis : He has a very specific diet I'm supposed to follow.
Castle : Well, unless he's Ben, I'm sure he won't hold it against me.
Castle : If anyone needs me, I'll be in the park with a dead body.
UNK: Bye.
Alexis : Who's Ben?
Martha : Killer rat movie. Before your time.
