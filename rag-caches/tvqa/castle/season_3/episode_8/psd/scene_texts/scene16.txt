Esposito : Donegal called in sick for work yesterday and today.
Montgomery : Divorced parents, one child.
Montgomery : One spouse re-marries quickly.
Beckett : So she dumps the janitor in the city for the doctor in the 'burbs.
UNK: All the father has left is his son.
Montgomery : It's got all the hallmarks of a custodial abduction.
Beckett : You got a photo?
Esposito : I'll get one.
Esposito : Dean Donegal.
UNK: 5'10", 175, brown hair.
Beckett : Well, the vitals match.
Castle : Yeah, but why do you need a gun to kidnap your own son?
Castle : You just put him in the car, tell him you're going for ice cream.
Castle : What's he doing?
Ryan : Hey, Beckett, the mother's here.
Alexis : All right. Ryan, you go to Dean's office.
UNK: Esposito, you check out his apartment.
Beckett : Maybe something else is going on with that family.
Esposito : Right. Right.
UNK: Mirielle Leftcourt : Where's my son?
Beckett : That's what we're trying to determine, Mrs. Lefcourt.
Beckett : When was the last time that you spoke with him?
Mirielle : Two days ago, when I dropped him off at his father's.
UNK: Elliot Leftcourt : He was supposed to be with Dean. Have you talked to Dean?
Beckett : We're trying to locate him now.
Mirielle : He's not at work? He never misses work.
Beckett : Can you tell me about the divorce? How did Dean take that?
Mirielle : Not well. He was very bitter and angry.
Beckett : Does he own a gun?
