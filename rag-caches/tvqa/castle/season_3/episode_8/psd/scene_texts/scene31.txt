UNK: It's kind of poetic.
Castle : In an unspeakably tragic sort of way.
Montgomery : The guy you shot in the subway?
UNK: A thug Kincaid hired to do his dirty work.
Montgomery : He just confessed to kidnapping Tyler,
UNK: murdering Light Bulb Len
Montgomery : and, no surprise, he ratted out Kincaid in two seconds flat.
UNK: Oh.
Castle : Speaking of rats.
UNK: I gotta... I gotta go.
Alexis : I'm the worst person in the whole world.
Castle : No, you're not.
UNK: You're wonderful and you're kind and you're sweet.
Alexis : I'm a rat killer.
Castle : You don't know that.
Castle : You may just be a loser.
Castle : A rat loser.
Castle : This did not come out right.
UNK: Look,
UNK: if he cares, he'll understand.
UNK: Yeah, he'll understand, all right.
Alexis : When he sees me in the halls at school, he'll think,
UNK: "There's the awful girl that lost my best friend."
