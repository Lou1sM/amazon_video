UNK: And if I help you, they'll kill my son.
Beckett : Where is Tyler, Dean?
Dean : I told you, I don't know!
Castle : Why were you going to Indianapolis?
UNK: Indian... What are you talking about?
Castle : We know you were checking on airfares.
Dean : I was researching a trip for the holidays.
Dean : What? You think I took my own son?
Beckett : You were in a hotel by the airport.
Dean : That's where they told me to go!
UNK: Who?
UNK: Please.
UNK: They said if I talk to the cops, he's dead.
Beckett : Dean, if your son is in danger, then you need to tell us what you know.
Dean : I went to pick him up after practice.
Dean : When he wasn't at the usual spot, I figured he must have walked home.
