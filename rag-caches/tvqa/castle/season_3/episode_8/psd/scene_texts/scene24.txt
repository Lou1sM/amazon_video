UNK: Okay.
Dean : Don't let them hurt my boy.
UNK: Where is he? Where's Tyler?
UNK: You should've been there to pick him up at soccer practice!
UNK: I should never have agreed to joint custody.
Elliot : - How could you let this happen? - Stay of out this. You're not family.
Elliot : - He's my boy, too! - Sit down!
UNK: That's enough!
Montgomery : Now I need everyone to calm down,
Montgomery : cooperate and think.
UNK: Dean, did you notice anyone unusual hanging around your son?
Montgomery : Anything out of the ordinary going on in his life?
UNK: No. I mean, I don't think so.
Montgomery : What about you two?
Elliot : Nothing comes to mind.
UNK: No.
Montgomery : Now this abduction was clearly planned.
Montgomery : So the kidnapper had to know where Tyler was going to be...
Montgomery : Sir, this is a message. It's from the kidnapper.
Montgomery : There's a video attached.
Mirielle : Thank God. He's alive.
UNK: There's a time-stamp on it, 1 : 31 a.m.
Beckett : That was sent eight minutes ago.
UNK: That's a good thing, Mrs. Lefcourt. It's called a proof of life video.
Montgomery : The kidnappers sent it to prove your son's alive
Montgomery : and that you do exactly what they ask.
Mirielle : You will do exactly what they ask you to. Do you understand?
