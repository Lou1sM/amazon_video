UNK: the express only takes, what, 10 minutes?
Castle : Plenty of time to get to the park and kill Len.
Mario : Why would I kill Len?
Castle : Because he filed a report against you with the Transit Authority
Castle : when he found out about Costa Rica.
Mario : What the hell are you guys talking about?
Beckett : These are emails that were sent from you
Beckett : to your contact in Costa Rica.
Mario : These are my private emails.
Beckett : Sent from a workplace computer. Which means we can look.
Mario : So? I was thinking about taking a vacation down there.
Castle : Sell some light bulbs to some locals.
Beckett : The city has a warehouse full of old incandescent light bulbs
Beckett : that you figured no one would miss.
Beckett : So you sold them to a wholesaler in Costa Rica for 20 cents a pop.
Beckett : That's a hundred grand.
Castle : Only someone did miss them.
Castle : Someone with the word "light bulb" in his name.
UNK: When you found out Len was onto you,
Castle : you realized you could lose your job and your pension.
