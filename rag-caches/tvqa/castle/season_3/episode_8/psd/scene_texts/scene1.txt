Beckett : You. Hey, Lanie.
UNK: Was this a hit and run?
UNK: Lanie Parish : In a manner of speaking.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Two BMX bikers rode over the body, then called it in.
UNK: Lanie Parish : But the cause of death are the gunshot wounds.
UNK: Lanie Parish : One to the chest,
UNK: Lanie Parish : and two more in the back.
Beckett : So he's wounded on both sides?
Castle : Maybe there were two shooters? He was caught in the crossfire?
UNK: Won't know till I get him back to the lab.
UNK: Got an ID?
UNK: Leonard Levitt, Ozone Park, Queens.
Lanie : Wallet, cash, keys. Everything still here.
Beckett : Which means it wasn't theft.
UNK: No.
Castle : Something much more nefarious.
Castle : A feather.
Castle : Alternating stripes, uniform color.
Castle : This is no ordinary pigeon feather. This is from a bird of prey.
Beckett : So what are you suggesting, Castle?
Beckett : That a bird shot him three times?
Castle : Not just any bird.
Castle : This is the calling card
Castle : of a murderer known only as the Falcon Killer.
