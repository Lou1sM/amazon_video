Castle : You are Theodore.
Castle : - What do you want? - Food.
UNK: Nah, you got a personal chef. You're not hungry.
UNK: Warmth.
Alexis : I'd want to stay warm and safe.
UNK: Yeah, a cozy, quiet place out of the way,
UNK: where no one's gonna step on you.
Alexis : - Front hall closet! - Nice.
Castle : You see him?
Alexis : No. He's not here.
Alexis : He's not here.
UNK: What?
Alexis : You need to go.
Castle : And leave you rat-less?
Alexis : It's my responsibility, Dad. Not yours. I'll find him.
Castle : - Are you sure? - Yeah.
UNK: Right. Call me if you need anything.
UNK: Okay.
Martha : Just so you know, I'm checking into The Plaza,
Martha : and you're paying.
Beckett : Okay, Castle, I'm here. What was so important?
Castle : Your first clue is
Castle : the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.
UNK: Oh, jeez, Castle. I haven't even had my coffee yet.
Beckett : Thank you.
Castle : Holmes unmasks the murderer because of what didn't happen.
Castle : The dog didn't bark.
Castle : That's how he knew the dog must've known the killer.
Beckett : Okay, yes. I remember the story.
UNK: Then you know that the hardest form of detection
Castle : is looking for the thing that isn't there.
Castle : Byron said that Len was going to verify the hawks.
Castle : Verify, as in provide proof, which means...
UNK: He would've had a camera.
Castle : Which we didn't find.
Castle : And if he was taking pictures...
Beckett : We should be able to figure out what he was up to.
Castle : We found the body here, where he took the last two bullets.
Beckett : Running away from his killer.
UNK: He had a broken wrist.
Beckett : From the BMX guys riding over his body.
