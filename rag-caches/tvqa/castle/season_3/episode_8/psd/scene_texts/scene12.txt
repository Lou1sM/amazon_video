Castle : I'm putting that in the official record.
Beckett : So the equipment, the park,
Beckett : the feather, and BHS.
Ryan : Looks like we've explained everything.
Castle : Yes, except why he was killed.
Castle : Good morning, Mother.
UNK: Morning.
Castle : So why is Gram on the table and why are you on the floor?
Alexis : Dad, he's gone.
UNK: Theodore?
Alexis : When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,
Alexis : I must not have closed the cage door all the way.
Alexis : And now he's gone and Ashley's going to hate me.
Castle : He's not going to hate you. He'll understand.
Alexis : No, he won't. He trusted me and I let him down.
Castle : No, not yet you haven't.
Castle : We'll find him. Have you looked in your room?
Alexis : And in Gram's, too.
Martha : If that creature entered my room, I'm gonna need a new bed.
Martha : And wardrobe.
Alexis : Dad, what if he got out? Like out, out.
UNK: All right, Theodore's an uptown rat. He's here someplace.
Castle : Okay, to find a rodent, you have to think like a rodent.
