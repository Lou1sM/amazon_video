UNK: Separately.
UNK: Katherine Beckett, I never...
Castle : Hello, ladies.
Alexis : Hey, Dad. Gram told me how you went all Jason Bourne on her date.
Castle : Come on, I think I deserve some kudos
Castle : for my selfless courage in the face of perceived danger.
Martha : Think what you will.
UNK: I have taken the liberty of selecting an apology gift.
Martha : Page 47, dog-eared for your convenience.
Castle : - The dress? - Uh-huh.
Martha : And the shoes. Oh!
Martha : And the purse.
Martha : Where did you get this, darling?
Castle : From a woman I met on the case. She's an aspiring writer.
Castle : In a moment of weakness, I told her I'd read it.
Martha : It's really pretty good.
Martha : She's got very vivid characters, well-plotted.
Martha : Pleasantly salacious.
Castle : Great. That's what I'll tell her.
UNK: Carrie Edwards : No, no, no.
Martha : You said you would read it, honey. You.
Castle : I will. I just have to do a little more thinking on the case.
Alexis : He's procrastinating.
Castle : - No, I am not. - I know!
Castle : I am just about to solve a critical piece of our mystery.
Martha : Now that you've determined that Lance is not the ax murderer.
Alexis : So, what's the critical piece of evidence, Dad?
Castle : Shortly before she died,
Castle : Sarah Cutler said that someone had betrayed her.
Castle : I think that person is our killer.
Martha : Well, then it could be anybody, darling,
Martha : because betrayal is a way of life on a soap opera.
