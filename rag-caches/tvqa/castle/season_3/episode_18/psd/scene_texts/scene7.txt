Beckett : So the night that your wife was killed,
Beckett : she e-mailed your mistress,
Beckett : and you didn't think that that was important to mention?
UNK: Vincent Powers : It wasn't a big deal.
UNK: Vincent Powers : I asked Mandy about it.
UNK: Vincent Powers : Well, she got some new script pages that Sarah wanted her to look over,
UNK: Vincent Powers : so she went home to memorize them.
Beckett : Were you alone the rest of the night?
UNK: Vincent Powers : Yes. Yes. I cracked the mini-bar, I ordered pay-per-view. You can check.
Castle : I will.
Castle : It can't be the husband.
UNK: Well, he's got motive.
Castle : Yeah, but marriage on the rocks, killing for money? It's just so...
UNK: Ordinary.
Castle : We need to focus on Mandy Bronson,
UNK: home-wrecking diva engaged in a torrid affair with the victim's husband.
Castle : She fled their illicit love nest after a mysterious e-mail from Sarah
Castle : on the eve of her murder.
Beckett : Yeah, but we don't even know if there was an e-mail.
Beckett : I mean, Vincent could have been lying.
Beckett : But you are right, Mandy Bronson does have some explaining to do.
UNK: "Esplanie."
Castle : - What? - Lanie and Esposito.
UNK: Like "FoxCan." We can call them "Esplanie."
Castle : Which is perfect, because they're always explaining things.
Castle : - Mother. - Hi.
Beckett : Martha, what a surprise.
Castle : Yes, what an unexpected surprise. What are you doing here?
UNK: Grieving.
Castle : You didn't even know the victim.
Martha : Darling, a loss for a show like this
Martha : is a loss for anyone who was ever part of its history.
