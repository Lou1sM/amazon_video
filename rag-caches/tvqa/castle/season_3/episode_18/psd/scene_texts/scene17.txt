Beckett : so she writes his mistress, Mandy Bronson,
Beckett : off the show in order to save their marriage.
Castle : And her next step would be to get rid of the other man.
Beckett : So maybe the other man didn't go off quietly into the night.
Ryan : Do you two practice this when we're not around?
Beckett : These earrings are exclusive to Arthur Klein's boutique in Chelsea.
Beckett : Let's find out who bought them.
UNK: Okay, so, Gloria is in the clear. Uniforms showed her photo at the OTB,
UNK: and a bartender there remembers seeing her at 11 : 15.
Castle : You know, I can see why she fell for Gloria's con.
Castle : Sarah was motherless, childless.
Castle : She was taking young writers under her wing.
UNK: She was looking for family.
Beckett : Wow, Castle. That's a refreshingly down-to-earth theory.
Castle : Just trying to keep you on your toes.
UNK: Hey!
Ryan : So, we ran down purchases at Klein's boutique and guess who popped?
Martha : - Lance Hastings? - Lance Hastings.
Esposito : That's not all.
Esposito : I ran Lance's credit card activity to confirm the purchase,
UNK: and something else caught my eye.
Esposito : Lance charged a cab ride to the studio the night of the murder.
UNK: Yeah, when we interviewed him, he said he went straight home at 6 : 00 p.m.
UNK: The cab company drove him back to the studio around 8 : 00.
Beckett : Okay, so, that falls right within the window of our time of death.
Beckett : Go pick him up.
