UNK: Lance Hastings : Is that what you think is going on here?
UNK: Lance Hastings : You think that Sarah and I were lovers?
Beckett : Did you or did you not buy
Beckett : an expensive pair of diamond earrings for her?
UNK: Lance Hastings : Yes, but not to woo her.
UNK: Lance Hastings : It was to encourage Sarah to let me out of my contract for a movie role.
UNK: Lance Hastings : A movie role?
UNK: Yes. The Coen brothers have asked me to play
UNK: Lance Hastings : Matt Damon's half-wit dad in their new movie.
UNK: Lance Hastings : It's a role of a lifetime.
UNK: Lance Hastings : It has nominations written all over it.
UNK: But that still doesn't explain why you went back to the studio that night.
UNK: Lance Hastings : I went to thank Sarah in person,
UNK: Lance Hastings : because my agent had called me that evening
UNK: Lance Hastings : to tell me that she had agreed to let me out.
UNK: Lance Hastings : The reason I didn't mention any of this
UNK: Lance Hastings : is I didn't want to risk missing work on the movie.
Beckett : Why didn't you just call her?
UNK: Lance Hastings : I wanted her to know how much I appreciated it.
Beckett : So you went back to thank her and that's it?
UNK: Lance Hastings : No. Not exactly.
UNK: Lance Hastings : When I got there, she was reading a script,
UNK: Lance Hastings : and she seemed upset.
UNK: Lance Hastings : I asked her why,
UNK: Lance Hastings : and she said somebody had betrayed her.
UNK: Who?
UNK: Lance Hastings : At first I thought it was me for taking the movie role.
