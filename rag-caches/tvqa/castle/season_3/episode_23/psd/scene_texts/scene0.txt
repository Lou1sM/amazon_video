UNK: That's like 500 miles from Manhattan.
UNK: Alexis Castle : No, I know Northwestern is closer than Stanford,
UNK: Alexis Castle : I'm just saying that's not where you want to go!
UNK: Alexis?
Alexis : Hold on, Ash. My dad's talking to me.
Alexis : - What? - Don't you have school?
UNK: Yes.
Alexis : Look, Ash, I know you. And I think you need to get away from home.
Alexis : I mean, we all need to get away from home.
UNK: Hey!
Alexis : I gotta go. We'll talk about this later.
Alexis : Love you, too. Bye.
Alexis : We all need to get away from home?
Alexis : No. I should never leave.
UNK: Ew!
Castle : You look like you didn't get any sleep.
Alexis : I didn't. I mean, Ashley got his college acceptances.
Alexis : He got in everywhere.
Castle : That's great!
