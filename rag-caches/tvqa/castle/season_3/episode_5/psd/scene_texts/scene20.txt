Beckett : That's what you call special?
UNK: Well, I'm assuming they're on a budget.
UNK: All right, where's the first place you'd go?
Beckett : I don't know. Someplace romantic.
Beckett : Someplace with special meaning, maybe?
Castle : Like the first place they met?
UNK: Here. "I'll never forget the first time I laid eyes on you.
UNK: "That cold, rainy night inside the Burgeropolis in Hillsdale."
Castle : Hillsdale, New Jersey.
UNK: Burgeropolis? You think that's their special place?
UNK: Yeah. No, that's stupid.
Beckett : Maybe we'll get lucky with the APBs.
