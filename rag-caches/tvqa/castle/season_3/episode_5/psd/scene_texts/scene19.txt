UNK: "...harder."
Castle : A poet he's not.
Beckett : Yeah, well not everyone is a best-selling crime novelist.

Beckett : "I can't bear to see you suffer.
UNK: "Make a new life with someone else. Just be happy.

Castle : "I don't believe in much, but I believe in us."

Castle : You're right. These are worthless.

Beckett : Where would you go?
UNK: Motel.
UNK: Really?
