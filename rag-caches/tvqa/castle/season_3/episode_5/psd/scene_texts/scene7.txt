Castle : Calderon's way of saying "I'm just not that into you."
Beckett : I don't know. An air embolism doesn't exactly strike me
UNK: like a drug lord's MO.

Beckett : The thing I don't get is how a respected doctor
UNK: can literally get into bed with a known drug lord.
Castle : Ladies love the bad boys.
