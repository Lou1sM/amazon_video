Calderon : They're a set.
Castle : Well, considering it's an heirloom, no wonder you wanted it back.
Calderon : I don't know what you mean.
Beckett : It wasn't on her body when she was found.
Beckett : Someone removed it.
Beckett : What happened?
Castle : Did she reject you?
Castle : Is that when the old Calderon returned?
UNK: Not the cognac-swirling Renaissance man we see before us,
Castle : but the ruthless killer?
Calderon : Be careful, Mr. Castle.
Calderon : This is not one of your fictions where people bleed ink.
Calderon : I loved her, yes.
Calderon : But I did not kill her.
Calderon : I was here.
Beckett : And you're wealthy enough to have bought that alibi.
Calderon : This is outrageous.
