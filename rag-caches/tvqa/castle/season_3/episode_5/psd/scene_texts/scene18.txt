Lanie : it'd be a pretty romantic story.
Montgomery : Hold on now. I thought Greg had a solid alibi for her murder?
Beckett : Well, sir, we think that an accomplice was helping him out.
Beckett : So, we're looking into known associates
Beckett : and we've also got a team out at Greg's apartment
Beckett : looking to see if they can find any leads.
Beckett : We're also monitoring his credit cards
Beckett : and we've issued APBs for the Tri-State area,
Beckett : but given all of the planning,
Beckett : they probably already had an escape route planned.
Beckett : But, if we're lucky, we'll catch a break.
Castle : I think we just did.
Castle : Greg's letters to Amy.
Castle : If they'd been planning this for a long time,
Castle : there's gotta be a clue in the letters.
Montgomery : Call the crew over at Greg's. If we can find Amy's letters to Greg,
UNK: - then we'll have a full set. - Yes, sir.
UNK: And these are just love notes.
Beckett : There's nothing in here about the escape.
UNK: Well, then we have to look at these like a romance novel,
Castle : not a murder mystery.
Castle : These people are baring their souls in these letters.
