UNK: Funeral Director : I've never seen her before
UNK: Funeral Director : and I have no idea how her body got in that casket.
UNK: Funeral Director : This morning, when I came in,
UNK: Funeral Director : I found one of my back windows smashed.
Esposito : So you're saying somebody broke in here
Esposito : and stashed a body in one of your coffins?
UNK: Funeral Director : I called the police, but since nothing was missing,
UNK: Funeral Director : you guys didn't bother showing up.
UNK: Funeral Director : Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have Mrs. Manks out for my blood.
