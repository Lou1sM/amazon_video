Beckett : It wasn't on her body when she was found.
Beckett : Someone removed it.
Beckett : What happened?
Castle : Did she reject you?
Castle : Is that when the old Calderon returned?
UNK: Not the cognac-swirling Renaissance man we see before us,
Castle : but the ruthless killer?
Calderon : Be careful, Mr. Castle.
Calderon : This is not one of your fictions where people bleed ink.
Calderon : I loved her, yes.
Calderon : But I did not kill her.
Calderon : I was here.
Beckett : And you're wealthy enough to have bought that alibi.
Calderon : This is outrageous.
Calderon : I will not be slandered.
Beckett : It is not slander if there is proof.
Beckett : This is a photo from an ATM camera
Beckett : the night that she was killed, about a block and a half away
Beckett : from the funeral home where her body was dumped.
Castle : That's your car, Mr. Calderon.
Castle : The same one you and Valerie used to take your long, romantic drives.
Calderon : No, you're mistaken...
Beckett : Save it, Calderon. We found nylon fibers on her body.
UNK: Gray.
UNK: Just like the color of the carpet on the back of your DeVille.
Beckett : So what was her body doing stuffed in the trunk of your car?
Calderon : I was here. I...
Calderon : I remember the...
Calderon : I was here.
Lanie : But you...
Calderon : You took the keys that night.
Calderon : It was you.
Calderon : I can see it in your eyes, Manolo. It was you.
Greg : I had to.
Manuel : I did it for you.
Alexis : - Why? - She was an informant, Cesar!
UNK: When I saw her with the man at the diner,
Manuel : I followed him.
Manuel : And you know what I found?
UNK: He work for the Attorney General.
Manuel : She betrayed you!
Calderon : Why didn't you come to me?
UNK: Because you were too blinded, brother.
Manuel : And when you gave her Mother's bracelet,
Manuel : I knew it was up to me to keep Valerie from hurting you.
Calderon : What did you do, Manolo?
