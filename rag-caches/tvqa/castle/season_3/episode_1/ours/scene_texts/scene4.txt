Alexis : A penguin smacks another penguin into an ice hole.
Alexis : I'll show you.
Castle : Uh... Maybe later.
UNK: Oh! You look as if someone smacked you into an ice hole.
Castle : I stopped by the precinct.
Alexis : I thought you weren't going back till after the book tour.
Castle : Yeah, well, fate intervened. Someone I know was murdered today.
Martha : Oh, Lord.
Alexis : Dad, that's awful. Who?
UNK: Maya, that woman who made that sculpture for me.
Alexis : - Any leads? - No, not yet.
Martha : So how is everyone?
Martha : Beckett have a nice summer?
UNK: Yeah, everyone's fine.
Martha : Now why don't I believe you?
Castle : Aren't you with Chet on Tuesdays?
Martha : Oh! That was never set in stone.
Martha : Besides, Alexis is in crisis.
Martha : The young man from the summer program still hasn't called her.
UNK: Despite the fact he said we'd talk when he got back from Europe,
Alexis : which he already did.
UNK: If you knew he's back, why didn't you just call him?
UNK: He's the one who went away.
Alexis : I mean, if he still cared he would have called.
Castle : Maybe he was going to but he didn't know how you'd feel about him.
Castle : Maybe he was worried that something had changed while he was away.
Martha : Oh, Richard Castle, that is the stupidest thing I ever heard.
Martha : Have I taught you nothing about relationships?
Castle : You're a shining example.
Castle : Just how big a deal is this anyway?
Beckett : I don't know if I even wanna see him anymore.
UNK: Oh, come on, you're not even giving him a chance.
Alexis : Why are you siding with him?
UNK: I'm not. I just... maybe
Castle : he'll do something that will make it right.
Castle : Maybe he'll just...
Castle : Maybe he'll surprise you.
Alexis : Maybe he missed his chance.
