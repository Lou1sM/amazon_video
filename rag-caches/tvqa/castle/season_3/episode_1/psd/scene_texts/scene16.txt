Dean : your boy here, he paid me back the entire sum plus interest.
Beckett : Do you really expect me to believe that?
Dean : No, I don't, sweetheart.
Dean : But that don't mean it ain't true.
Esposito : His alibi checks.
Esposito : He was in Jersey all day yesterday shopping in Short Hills with the missus.
Beckett : Wow. Lucky girl.
Ryan : Doesn't mean he didn't do it. He could've hired someone.
UNK: Yeah. To kill McCutchin, but why Maya and Chloe?
Ryan : Maybe they witnessed the hit.
Esposito : Maybe they co-signed the loan.
UNK: Do we have McCutchin's financials?
Esposito : Yeah. They should all be up shortly. Why?
UNK: Carbino said that McCutchin paid off his debt in full plus interest.
UNK: I was thinking that's a lot of money for a guy in the vending machine business,
UNK: and I thought, "Where did that money come from?"
Beckett : You know, all of McCutchin's accounts were overdrawn.
Beckett : And then suddenly two weeks ago, 9,500 appears in his savings.
Beckett : Two weeks ago?
Esposito : On the 7th.
UNK: There was a deposit made in Maya Santori's account
Esposito : on the 7th for the same amount.
Beckett : What about Chloe Whitman?
