Castle : So how about you? You still with that cop boyfriend of yours?
Castle : What was his name again? Demming?
Castle : You broke up?
Beckett : This victim that called you, what was it about?
Castle : She said she was in trouble and she couldn't go to the police.
Beckett : So why did she call you?
Castle : Because Maya knew I had a relationship with you... Ooh!
Castle : With the NYPD. She thought I could help.
Beckett : Help how?
Castle : She didn't say, she just told me to come over.
Castle : When I got there, the door was open, the place was trashed.
