UNK: Did she find anything?
UNK: Officer Lt : Nothing useful.
Castle : Mind if I take a look around?
Castle : Hey, brother.
Castle : Looks like you missed one.
UNK: Csu Tech : Got it.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey.
Lanie : I hear you made an interesting arrest today.
UNK: You wanna talk about it?
UNK: Kate Beckett : - No. - Okay.
Lanie : You keep holding that stuff in, you're gonna get an ulcer.
Beckett : Anything unusual?
Lanie : You mean besides the gunshots?
Beckett : Yeah, I'm looking for anything that'll connect these two victims.
Lanie : They both had tattoos.
Beckett : Everyone has tattoos.
Lanie : Chloe Whitman, our jumper, has a rose.
UNK: And Miss Santori has a mermaid
Lanie : on her back.
Lanie : Looking at the work, it could be the same tattoo artist.
Beckett : Anything else?
Lanie : It may be nothing, but I found this on Miss Whitman's hand.
Lanie : Could be an apartment number, gym locker code.
Lanie : And looking at how faded it is, I'd say she wrote it about a week ago.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Oh! And I found these in Miss Santori's pockets.
Beckett : Cab receipts?
Lanie : Dated today, just a few hours before she was killed.
Beckett : Okay. I'll call up the cab company, see if we can retrace her whereabouts.
Beckett : Are you sure you don't wanna talk about it?
UNK: Positive.
Esposito : We just got the phone records back on our vics.
Esposito : Turns out they did have a connection.
Esposito : They both received phone calls from the same number
Esposito : within hours of their deaths.
Beckett : Were you able to run it down?
UNK: Yeah, traced back to a Todd McCutchin.
UNK: He's got priors, including robbery and domestic assault.
Beckett : You got an address?
UNK: Yeah, we got an address.
Esposito : Let me see your hands!
Esposito : I said let me see your...
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Hi.
Castle : I can explain.
Beckett : Turn around.
Castle : Would you just listen to me, please?
Beckett : Why? You don't listen to me.
UNK: Look, I'm just doing some digging around on my own.
Castle : That's not a crime, is it?
Beckett : No, but criminal trespassing is. And so is murder.
Castle : - I was just trying to help. - I don't need your help.
Beckett : How did you get here anyway?
Castle : I was following up a lead. Same as you.
Beckett : Really? So you subpoenaed the victim's phone records
Beckett : and looked for commonalities?
Castle : No, not exactly.
Beckett : Then what?
UNK: Okay, I star-69-ed. I star-69-ed.
UNK: You star-69-ed?
Castle : Yes, on Maya's phone. I figured it would give me her last call.
UNK: Rang up McCutchin here, I got his name from his voicemail
Castle : and then I did a web search.
Castle : Tell me you're not impressed.
Beckett : You went to an active crime scene without authorization.
UNK: Uh...
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : But I wore gloves.
Esposito : Yo, Beckett,
Esposito : this body's cold.
UNK: It's been dead for hours.
Castle : See? I didn't kill him.
UNK: Slugs?
Esposito : We'll have to run ballistics,
Esposito : but the entry wounds are the same size as our other vics'.
Esposito : - Odd. - What?
UNK: The guy's in vending machines. Not an obvious choice
UNK: to be running around with an artist and a prep school teacher.
UNK: Hmm.
