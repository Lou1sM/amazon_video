Beckett : What kind of stuff?
UNK: "I know what you're doing. I know all about it."
Kitty : I guess he thought she was screwing someone else.
Evan : Okay. So I followed Chloe to the club that night.
Evan : But only because she was acting weird.
UNK: Secretive.
Evan : I thought she was seeing another guy.
Beckett : Mr. Murphy, why didn't you tell us this before?
UNK: That I'd been fighting with my girlfriend? That I threatened her?
Evan : I know how cops work.
Castle : And when you found out about the other victims,
Castle : that they were all there at the club?
Evan : I didn't kill her.
Evan : I didn't kill any of them.
Evan : What would you have done?
Beckett : I would try to help find her killer.
UNK: But if I had told you then what you know now,
Evan : would you have looked any further than me?
Beckett : Mr. Murphy, the money in Chloe's account, where did it come from?
