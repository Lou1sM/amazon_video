UNK: So, plates, paper.
Beckett : There's only one missing ingredient.
UNK: Castle & Beckett : I know who the killer is.
Beckett : Let's go.
UNK: Come on! Hurry up!
Kitty : Get the plates. The plates!
Beckett : Going somewhere?
Esposito : Let me see your hands.
Beckett : Step away from the bags and walk forward.

Kitty : What gave me away?
Castle : The missing ingredient.
UNK: Ink.
Castle : And who better to provide it than a tattoo artist?
Beckett : That and Evan Murphy.
UNK: You knew that we'd follow up after you told us that story.
Beckett : So you planted that gun,
UNK: but you just didn't have enough time to put his prints on it, did you?
UNK: - Sweep the area... Look out!
Beckett : Go! Go! Get him!
Esposito : Move, move, move! Let's go! Come on!
Beckett : Where's Kitty?
Castle : The money's gone.
Beckett : You stay here.
Castle : What if they come back?
Beckett : Hey! Hey!
UNK: Is that him? Got him?
UNK: Where'd he go?
Castle : I think he went around this way.
UNK: I don't see him!
UNK: Come out, police! Police!
UNK: Kate Beckett : Castle! Down on the ground, now!
UNK: Drop it. Drop it.
UNK: Stay right where you are.
UNK: Stay where you are. Don't touch the gun!
Beckett : They hatched the plan late one night at the club.
Beckett : They figured, victimless crime. Nobody would get hurt.
Castle : Kitty and Earl would launder the bills through the club
Castle : and then make cash payments to the others.
Montgomery : Sounds like they had a sweet deal going on. How did it all go wrong?
UNK: Todd McCutchin.
Castle : He was getting squeezed by a loan shark.
