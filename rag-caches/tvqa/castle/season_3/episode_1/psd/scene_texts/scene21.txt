Evan : What money?
Castle : So he admits to the fights and the threats,
UNK: but he claims not to know anything about the money.
UNK: Or how our victims are connected, other than the events of that night.
Castle : Do you believe him?
Beckett : Doesn't matter what I believe. He's a viable suspect.
Beckett : Hey, Ryan, I need you to get a search warrant for Evan Murphy's place.
Beckett : And, Esposito, how are things going over there?
Esposito : We ran the club's mailing list for people with priors.
Esposito : These are the ones that've popped so far.
