UNK: Man.
Beckett : Are you guys re-enacting the Humpty Dumpty crime scene?
Ryan : It's the autumnal equinox today.
UNK: Yeah, and according to Mr. Wizard there,
UNK: it's the only time of year you can balance an egg on its tip.
Beckett : Don't you guys have work to do?
Esposito : - Nah. - No, not really.
UNK: Hmm. Well, now you do.
Beckett : By the way,
UNK: that whole thing with the egg is just urban legend.
Ryan : Not true. I saw Castle do it last year.
Esposito : What's wrong with you?
Esposito : Still no word from him?
UNK: No.
Ryan : Maybe you should call him.
UNK: He said that he would be back in the fall. And it's fall.
Beckett : So, clearly, he has better things to do.
Esposito : Maybe he's not back from the Hamptons yet.
