Beckett : Let's start digging into their lives.
Beckett : If they were on the same dating site, I wanna know.
Beckett : If they were in the same twelve-step program, I wanna know.
Castle : How can I help?
Beckett : Look, Castle,
Beckett : I'm sorry about your friend, I really am.
UNK: But that doesn't mean you can show up and act like nothing has happened.
UNK: The truth is that if you wanted to come back, you would have already,
Beckett : but you didn't.
Beckett : So let's just face it.
Beckett : The only reason that you're here right now
Beckett : is because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Castle : Did you ever stop and think maybe I was waiting to hear from you?
Castle : Do you know what these bodies are?
Castle : A sign.
Castle : - A sign? - A sign.
Castle : A sign from the universe telling us we need to solve this case together.
UNK: You don't wanna let the universe down, do you?
UNK: You're not gonna go away no matter what I do, are you?
Castle : I respect the universe.
