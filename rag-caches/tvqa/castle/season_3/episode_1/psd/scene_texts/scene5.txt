Castle : She was dead on the bed and there was a gun on the floor.
Beckett : So you being the expert veteran of dozens of crime scenes,
Beckett : decided to pick up the murder weapon, to what?
UNK: Ensure that we had your prints?
Castle : Maybe you missed the part where I said she was shot dead.
Castle : When I heard the noises coming from the next room,
UNK: I thought whoever killed her was coming back.
Castle : So I picked up the gun to defend myself.
Castle : It seemed like a very good idea at the time.
Castle : That's when you, Esposito and Annie Oakley come bursting through the door.
Castle : Annie Oakley?
UNK: I kind of almost shot Castle.
