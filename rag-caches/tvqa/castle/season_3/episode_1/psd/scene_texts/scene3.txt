Castle : I was going to call you.
Castle : But then you showed up before I could.
UNK: Really?
Beckett : Then why did we find you in our victim's apartment?
Castle : Because she called me.
UNK: Oh. So you and Miss Santori were in a relationship.
Castle : I wouldn't say it was a relationship. I bought a couple of sculptures...
Beckett : Were you sleeping with her?
Castle : - How is that relevant? - Motive.
UNK: Ah.
Castle : No, I wasn't sleeping with her.
Beckett : Are you sure? Beautiful woman...
Castle : - I'm in a relationship. - With whom?
Castle : - Is that a new lipstick? - Castle!
Castle : You know with whom.
Beckett : How should I know? I haven't seen you in months.
Beckett : You could have been in dozens of relationships with women since then.
Castle : You sound jealous.
Beckett : Jealous of you dating your second ex-wife and publisher?
Beckett : Tell me. Does she make you do everything on a deadline?
