Xander : She said she liked the way I looked.
Xander : You know how it goes.
Castle : When was the last time you saw her?
Beckett : Mr. Doyle, we have evidence that indicates
Beckett : that Maya came to see you the day she died.
Xander : Look. She said she was in trouble. She needed my help.
Beckett : What kind of trouble?
Xander : She wouldn't say.
UNK: Someone must've been after her.
Beckett : And why would you say that?
Xander : Because the reason she came to see me is she wanted to borrow a gun.
Castle : That's why she was armed.
UNK: She saw what happened to McCutchin, she figured she'd be next.
Beckett : Did Maya give you any indication as to what she might be involved in?
UNK: No.
Xander : If I was a betting man...
Xander : I ran into Maya a few weeks ago on the street.
UNK: When she gave me a hug, I could smell it.
Beckett : You could smell what?
Xander : That sick smell. Paint thinner, acetone, bleach.
UNK: I got a buddy who smells like that. You know what he does?
Xander : He makes meth.
Castle : I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner.
Beckett : Do you really think it was meth?
Castle : It's the only thing that makes any sense.
Castle : All of our victims were struggling financially.
Castle : One night, after the club closes, they're all together
Castle : talking about their money woes,
Castle : until our high school chemistry teacher cracks a smile and says,
UNK: "Well, we could always make meth."
Castle : But the others don't laugh.
UNK: They say, "Yeah. We could make meth."
Castle : Just like that cable show.
Castle : I'm telling you, it's drugs.
Lanie : It's not drugs.
