UNK: This place is like the circus with alcohol!
Castle : How have I never been here before?
Beckett : You think this is crazy,
Beckett : you should see some of the clubs I've been to.
Bartender : What can I get you?
UNK: Information.
Beckett : Do you recognize these people?
UNK: Yeah. They're part of Kitty's burlesque troupe.
Beckett : Kitty's troupe?
Bartender : Kitty Canary. She runs the place.
Beckett : And where can I find this Kitty?
Kitty : They're really dead?
UNK: We're afraid so.
Beckett : Your bartender said that they were a part of your troupe.
Kitty : Chloe would dance from time to time. Todd had a snake act.
Castle : What about Maya?
Kitty : She was more of a patron.
Kitty : She came for inspiration.
UNK: Hey, I just heard.
Kitty : Detective, this is my husband, Earl. He runs the burlesque with me.
Earl : Do you know what happened?
Beckett : We're looking into it.
Beckett : Right now the only connection we can find is this club.
Kitty : You don't think someone here killed them?
Beckett : How well did you know them?
Kitty : They were work friends, you know, "Hi. How are you?"
Kitty : Although Maya and Chloe did come to the shop once to get tattoos.
Kitty : My day job.
Beckett : Did the three of them spend a lot of time together?
Earl : No more so than anybody else.
Castle : Did they spend a lot of time with anyone else here?
Kitty : Not that I noticed.
Beckett : Do you have a mailing list of your regulars?
UNK: Yeah. I can get a copy if you want.
Beckett : Yes. And I'll also need a list of all of your employees
Beckett : and any other members of your troupe.
Kitty : Of course.
Beckett : Can you think of any other connection between the three of them?
Kitty : There was the incident.
Earl : A couple of weeks ago, Chloe's boyfriend came around.
Earl : Apparently, he didn't like her dancing here. He got a little rough.
Earl : Both Maya and Todd intervened.
Kitty : Evan was drunk, yelling all kinds of crazy stuff.
