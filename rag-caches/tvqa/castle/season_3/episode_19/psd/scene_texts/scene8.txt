Lanie : It looks like the killer switched out the contents of Joe's capsule
Lanie : and replaced it with the cyanide.
Beckett : Okay, so then when Joe was taking his medications,
Beckett : he unknowingly poisoned himself.
Lanie : But here's the rub,
Lanie : since the cyanide was in a time-release capsule
Lanie : designed not to dissolve in stomach acids
Lanie : but in the intestines...
Castle : Our timeline is all screwed up.
UNK: Yep. Turns out Joe was poisoned almost one hour before his death
UNK: at 8 : 13 this morning.
Beckett : That's before he even got to the courthouse.
Castle : Which means the killer probably wasn't there either.
Beckett : So then Joe's death might not have anything to do with the trial.
Castle : Well, we learned three very important things.
Castle : Firstly, our killer is diabolical.
Castle : You let someone unwittingly kill themselves, pure evil.
