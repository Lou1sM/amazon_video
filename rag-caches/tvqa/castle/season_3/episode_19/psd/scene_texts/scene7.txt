UNK: Wardell Williams : Looks like I'm poisoning this man's coffee.
UNK: When really, all I did was hand it to him.
Beckett : - Hey, Esposito. - Mmm?
Beckett : Can you get a warrant for Wardell's place,
Beckett : see if there's any traces of cyanide?
Esposito : You got it.
Castle : And as they say in legalese, asked and answered.
Castle : It's too bad. I was hoping there'd be a little more to the story than that.
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : "Hmm," what?
Castle : Alexis said she'd be in the Village today,
Castle : but she's over in Williamsburg.
Beckett : How do you know she's in Williamsburg?
Castle : GPS tracked her phone.
Beckett : You tracked her phone?
Castle : Yeah. Super cool app I just downloaded.
Castle : I can see where she is at any time.
Beckett : Does she know that you're doing this?
Castle : What, are you kidding? No, she'd kill me.
Beckett : And be justified!
Castle : I'm her father.
Castle : If something's going on, I need to know.
Castle : A lot of parents will go through their kids' drawers or computers.
Castle : Far less intrusive.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Joe's cyanide-laced coffee cup.
Lanie : CSU found both Joe and Wardell's prints on it.
Lanie : But there was something very important missing...
UNK: Cyanide.
UNK: Wardell Williams : - Really? - Really?
UNK: Really.
Beckett : Well, how was he poisoned?
Lanie : During the autopsy,
Lanie : I discovered cyanide residue in a prescription time-release capsule.
Castle : So Joe had a prescription for cyanide?
Lanie : No. He had a prescription for corticosteroids.
Lanie : According to his physician,
Lanie : he took one every morning for symptoms from lupus.
