Martha : Everything you need for a healthier and longer life.
UNK: What is the sense of living longer if you have to drink that?
Martha : Ah! That's the stuff.
Alexis : Good morning.
Martha : Good morning, darling. - Hey.
Castle : Hey, why aren't you in school?
Alexis : It's faculty development day.
UNK: Perfect. Because do you know what's playing at the Angelika?
UNK: Remember how much you used to love this? Want to go with me?
Alexis : Sorry, I can't. I made plans to spend the day in the Village.
Alexis : Delicious. Bye, Grams.
Alexis : - Bye, Dad. - Bye.
