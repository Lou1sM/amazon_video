UNK: Keys in the ignition.
UNK: I knew I should have passed it by, but I always wanted to drive a 760.
UNK: So I jumped in.
UNK: I'm sorry, we need details.
UNK: So, did you see anyone?
UNK: No.
Castle : Was there anything around the car?
Beckett : Anything that might suggest someone else had been there?
Beckett : Cigarette butts, chewing gum.
Castle : Shoe prints, heel prints.
UNK: Otis Williams : Nah, nothing like that.
UNK: Okay. What happened next?
UNK: Otis Williams : I slid in the ride, pulled the seat up, hit the ignition...
Beckett : Wait, wait. Did you say that you pulled the seat up?
UNK: Yeah.
Ryan : Are you sure?
UNK: Otis Williams : Yeah, I'm sure. That bad boy was all the way back.
UNK: Otis Williams : So I hit the button on the side to move it up.
UNK: Lyla was all of five foot nothing.
Beckett : There's no reason for that seat to have been all the way back.
Castle : Somebody else was driving that car, most likely our killer.
