Castle : Okay, so we know that Joe was a juror with a hidden agenda.
Castle : He was embroiled in a high-profile case
Castle : being tried by the DA himself.
Castle : But before he could accomplish what he set out to do,
Castle : he was struck down by powerful, shadowy forces.
UNK: What?
Beckett : There's gotta be something that we're missing.
Beckett : There has to be a tangible connection between Joe and our defendant,
Beckett : or Joe and our victim.
Ryan : Or between Joe and somebody else entirely.
Ryan : I found the phone.
Ryan : It was hiding behind some books in the bookcase.
UNK: Joe made 14 calls with it, all to the same number.
UNK: Wardell Williams : District Attorney Lou Karnacki's office.
Castle : Looks like the DA was out of order.
Beckett : Mrs. Craig...
UNK: Dawn Craig : Please, call me Dawn.
UNK: Dawn, you are District Attorney's administrative assistant?
UNK: Dawn Craig : Yes, ever since he came into office.
Beckett : Do you remember ever receiving any phone calls from a Joe McUsic?
Martha : Oh, uh...
UNK: Dawn Craig : We get hundreds of calls every day.
UNK: Dawn Craig : That name doesn't sound familiar.
Castle : We have reason to believe he called numerous times.
