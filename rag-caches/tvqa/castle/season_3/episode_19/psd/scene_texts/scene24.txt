UNK: Hank Ponzell : I don't know whether to be angry or proud.
Castle : What friends were you with?
UNK: It doesn't matter.
Castle : Well, of course it matters.
Alexis : Who I was with is off the table.
UNK: I'm not gonna narc on them.
Castle : Again, angry and proud.
Castle : One question, though.
Castle : If you didn't take anything, why did you feel responsible?
Alexis : Because they're my friends.
Alexis : I guess somebody had to.
Alexis : It was the right thing to do.
