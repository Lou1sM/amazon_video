Castle : I mean, they already had Otis Williams.
Beckett : It was open and shut.
Castle : Until Joe starts calling, insisting that Otis is innocent.
Castle : Which is bad for Karnacki.
Castle : Actually, in the end, bad for Joe.
UNK: No, but it still doesn't explain why Joe bought into the jury pool.
Beckett : Or why he thought that Otis Williams was innocent.
Beckett : I mean, if he had exonerating evidence, where is it?
Beckett : We've looked everywhere. We've talked to everyone.
Castle : Not everyone.
UNK: Attorney Nick Keller : As I said before, we're not here to discuss the Lyla Addison case.
Beckett : Neither are we. We're here to talk about Joe McUsic's murder.
Beckett : Juror number seven.
UNK: Attorney Nick Keller : You're not still suggesting that my client had something to do with that?
Castle : We are open to the idea
Castle : that Mr. Williams may not be guilty of either murder.
Beckett : Look, we think that you might be able to help yourself
Beckett : by helping us find the real killer.
