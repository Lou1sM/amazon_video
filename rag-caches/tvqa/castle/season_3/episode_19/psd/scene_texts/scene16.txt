Castle : Wardell Williams was right, it's a conspiracy.
Beckett : I agree.
Beckett : I know, weird.
Castle : Yeah, weird but good,
Castle : because that's just the tip of the iceberg.
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Good. I did a little digging on the Internet.
Castle : Guess who the DA's largest campaign contributors were
Castle : on his last election?
UNK: Who?
Castle : Randolph and Andrea Addison, Lyla's parents.
Castle : Here's what I'm thinking,

Castle : Insist that the DA try the case personally.
Castle : Maybe even suggest to Karnacki
Castle : that he needs to put Lyla's killer away,
Castle : in order to secure their political support.
Beckett : Of course, and Karnacki agreed, because it was gonna be an easy case.
