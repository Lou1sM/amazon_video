Castle : Don't you think they should be the ones paying?
UNK: Dad.
Castle : Why are you even friends with these girls in the first place?
Alexis : It's not that simple.
Castle : No, you're right.
Castle : It never is, is it?
Alexis : I'm sorry.
Alexis : No, Detective Beckett, stay. I was just leaving.
Alexis : It won't happen again, Dad.
UNK: Promise.
Beckett : You okay?
Castle : Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.
Beckett : Tell me about it.
Castle : Is that the CSU report?
Beckett : Two sets of prints on the seat controls.
UNK: Otis' are on the seat up button.
Castle : And on the seat back?
UNK: Take a look for yourself.
Castle : You gotta be kidding me!
Beckett : This is the fingerprint that we pulled off
UNK: of Lyla Addison's car seat controls,
Beckett : and this is your fingerprint that we have on file.
Beckett : They are a match.
UNK: Eddie Mcusic : - There must be some mistake. - There is no mistake.
UNK: You were in Lyla Addison's car the night that she was killed.
UNK: I didn't even know Lyla.
Castle : Yeah, you did.
Castle : We showed your picture around.
Castle : You're a bartender at the Kiwi Seven Lounge.
Castle : They pay you under the table cash.
UNK: Lyla was a silent partner.
UNK: You still wanna go with the story that you don't know her?
Beckett : I think that you killed her and then you dumped her body in her trunk.
Castle : What you didn't count on
Castle : was the guilt.
Castle : You had to get it off your chest, so you told Joe.
Castle : But your brother, he was an honorable man.
Beckett : He wasn't gonna rat you out,
Beckett : but he wasn't gonna let an innocent man go to jail for life.
Castle : So he called the DA.
Castle : When that didn't work, he got on the jury, but you...
Castle : You found out.
Castle : And you realized you wouldn't be safe as long as he was alive.
