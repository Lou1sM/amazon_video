Castle : You think Joe was chosen at random?
Castle : Or do you think he was killed because of his background?
Beckett : Well, since this isn't, in fact, a Grisham novel,
Beckett : I thought I'd keep an open mind.
Beckett : Hey, Ryan, can you look into Joe McUsic's halfway house?
UNK: See if he had problems with anyone there.
UNK: I already spoke with the staff. They don't remember any conflicts,
Ryan : but they're sending over a list of residents in case.
Esposito : Yo! Our missing juror?
Esposito : Troopers picked him up crossing the GW Bridge.
Esposito : They're bringing him in now.
Beckett : You were leaving town in a hurry, Mr. Muller. Any reason why?
UNK: Tony Mueller : Isn't it obvious? I'm marked for death, man.
UNK: Tony Mueller : Marked for death?
UNK: Tony Mueller : I didn't ask for jury duty, I was summoned.
UNK: It said show up at this time, at this place.
UNK: It failed to mention that the defendant's homeboy was gonna kill me.
UNK: Tony Mueller : The defendant's homeboy?
UNK: Tony Mueller : Yeah. This big scary black guy.
UNK: Exactly what happened, Mr. Muller?
UNK: Tony Mueller : Yesterday this guy follows me into the courthouse bathroom
UNK: Tony Mueller : and starts chatting me up about the trial.
Beckett : Did he give you his name?
UNK: No, no, but he was going on and on about how Otis Williams is innocent.
