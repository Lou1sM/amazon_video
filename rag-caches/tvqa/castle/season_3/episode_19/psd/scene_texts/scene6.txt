Beckett : They're testing it for cyanide.
Beckett : Why don't you just come clean, while we still got a deal to make?
UNK: Wardell Williams : Man, I told you, I ain't do nothing!
Beckett : Wardell, sit down! Before I make you sit down.
UNK: Wardell Williams : So obviously you must be the bad cop. Guess that makes you the good cop.
Castle : Actually, I'm not a cop.
UNK: You're not a cop?
Beckett : Mr. Castle is a writer. He consults with the department on occasion.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Wardell Williams : So that's how you two do it?
UNK: Wardell Williams : You tell the lies and you print the lies.
UNK: Man, y'all are framing me just like they did my cousin.
UNK: Wardell Williams : Man, this whole damn thing's a conspiracy.
Beckett : Wardell, be serious.
UNK: You don't think I'm serious?
UNK: Wardell Williams : Then tell me why of all the lawyers in the city,
UNK: Wardell Williams : the District Attorney is trying Otis' case?
UNK: Wardell Williams : You don't think it's 'cause he's running for mayor
UNK: Wardell Williams : and he wants to lock my cousin up
UNK: Wardell Williams : so all his rich, powerful white friends can feel safe?
Beckett : Look, you're not doing yourself any favors right now.
UNK: Wardell Williams : You just got it all worked out, huh?
UNK: Wardell Williams : You got my cousin O pulling a Bigger Thomas,
UNK: Wardell Williams : and you got me poisoning this man to get him off.
Castle : Looks that way.
UNK: Wardell Williams : Well, looks don't make it so.
