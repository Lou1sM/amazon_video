UNK: Eddie Mcusic : My brother's dead and it's all my fault.
Beckett : We can place Stephen at Lyla's bar that night.
Beckett : But without physical evidence, all we have is Eddie's word.
Beckett : What do you think we should do, sir?
Montgomery : I'm sorry, Detective.
Castle : It looks like there's nothing you can do.
Castle : What are you saying? We just let him get away with it?
Montgomery : Did I say that?
UNK: Sir, where are you going?
