UNK: You...
Simmons : If they had, she might not have gotten eaten.
Simmons : From what I hear, though,
Simmons : she was pretty tasty.
Castle : Whoa, Beckett!
Beckett : Back off, Castle!
Beckett : Remember your old life, Vulcan. Savor it.
UNK: Because I'm gonna take it all away.
Esposito : - Stand down. - Beckett, that's enough.
Esposito : Stand down!
Simmons : You want some, too? Come on.
Castle : That's enough!
UNK: I might have to kick that son of a bitch loose now, you realize that?
Beckett : Sir, you heard him. He as much as confessed to the murder.
UNK: Come on. He's playing you.
Montgomery : And you let him get under your skin, acting like a damn rookie.
Montgomery : We've got nothing to tie him to Raglan's murder or your mother's.
Montgomery : You're off this case.
Beckett : No, sir, you can't do that. Not now.
Montgomery : - I just did. - No.
Montgomery : I just did!
Montgomery : Now you go home.
UNK: Beckett?
UNK: Kate!
Montgomery : You, too, Castle. Clear out.
Castle : What did I do?
Montgomery : I don't need you playing Nancy Drew on this.
Montgomery : As of this moment, you two are running point on Raglan's homicide.
UNK: Uh...
Esposito : Captain, my partner and I don't wish to be insubordinate.
UNK: But we respectfully decline the assignment.
Montgomery : What does it say on my badge?
UNK: Detective Kevin Ryan : - Captain. - Now, read the fine print.
Montgomery : It says get your ass out there and solve Raglan's murder
Montgomery : before I bust you both back down to Traffic.
Beckett : - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.
UNK: You want to help her? Find that shooter.
Montgomery : Solve the damn case.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : What if it had been you?
Castle : I didn't know you were home.
Martha : I heard about the shooting on the news.
Martha : It could have been you. You know that, don't you?
Castle : Yeah, but I'm fine. It wasn't me.
Martha : Richard, this isn't one of your books.
