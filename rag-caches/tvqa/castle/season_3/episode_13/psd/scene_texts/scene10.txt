UNK: How about I drop you off at your place?
Castle : Not a chance.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Yo, so I checked out the 4th floor.
Esposito : There's no prints, no casings, no witnesses.
Esposito : But the good news is, it's a secure building.
Esposito : The only way in or out is through the lobby.
UNK: And nobody gets through the lobby turnstiles without a key card.
Castle : So our shooter had a card.
UNK: Yeah, they're sending over a list of all their employees.
UNK: They're also downloading surveillance video from the lobby.
UNK: Hey, so, I talked to the neighbors.
Ryan : Raglan was a widower. No next of kin that I could find.
Ryan : Super said he didn't really even have visitors,
Ryan : except every once in a while
Ryan : his buddy'd come over to watch a Yankee game.
Ryan : Gary McCallister. Raglan's old Academy classmate.
UNK: Get a hold of McCallister, see if he'll come in.
Beckett : I wanna talk to him.
Ryan : You got it.
Raglan : Nineteen years ago.
Castle : What's that?
UNK: Raglan started telling us about something that happened 19 years ago.
UNK: My mom's murder was 12 years ago. It's not making any sense.
UNK: You know, I sacrificed my best years and worst marriages
UNK: to this damn city.
UNK: You'd think that would be enough, but it never is.
UNK: It had to gobble up my best friend, too.
Beckett : When was the last time you saw John Raglan?
UNK: A week ago.
UNK: He told me he was dying.
Beckett : What else did he tell you?
UNK: Isn't that enough?
UNK: I don't get it. Raglan was retired by the time you came on the job.
UNK: What'd he want with you?
Beckett : Raglan was helping me with a cold case that I was working on,
UNK: and I believe he was killed to keep him quiet.
Beckett : Look, Raglan seemed to think
UNK: that the case had something to do with something he did 19 years ago.
