Beckett : Hey, Castle.
UNK: Hey.
Castle : Where's Josh?
Beckett : Oh, he's in Africa, he's saving the world.
UNK: Uh, I brought you some... I just thought after everything...
UNK: You might wanna...
UNK: Here.
Beckett : Thank you. That's really sweet.
Beckett : - You wanna come in? - Sure.
Castle : Wow! Nice.
Simmons : You know, I was thinking on the way over here.
Castle : All the best cops, Dirty Harry, Cobra,
Castle : they all have one thing in common.

Castle : they do their very best work after they've been booted off a case.
Beckett : Is that what you came all the way over here to tell me?
Castle : Montgomery booted us off the Raglan murder,
Castle : but he didn't say anything about your mother's case, did he?
