UNK: There would've been no way to trace the murders back to him.
Beckett : Until Raglan threatens to reveal his role in the conspiracy,

Esposito : We'll have him in the box before lunch.

Castle : Hey, that's enough!
Simmons : He's sweet on you.
Simmons : Makes him brave.
Beckett : What was your association with Detective John Raglan?

Simmons : Well, Detective, our association, as you put it,
Simmons : exceeded the statute of limitations many moons ago.
