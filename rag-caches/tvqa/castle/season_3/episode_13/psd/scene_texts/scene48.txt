Raglan : You don't,
UNK: Hal Lockwood : you jerk me around,
UNK: Hal Lockwood : and you will be begging me to before this night is up.
UNK: I'm going to have to go with option B.
Ryan : Oh, yeah.
UNK: We're definitely going to jerk you around.
Castle : What's her account number?
UNK: 5892-639-1199.
UNK: All right, if we can figure out her mother's maiden name,
Castle : they'll email us the password.
Beckett : I need everything you can get on Jolene Granger,
Beckett : specifically her mother's maiden name.
Ryan : Listen, ass clown,
Ryan : I was in Catholic school for 12 years.
Ryan : Hell, they used to do this to me for talking in class.
Esposito : You're dead, Lockwood.
Lockwood : Yeah, you know, they always start off with bravado.
Lockwood : The begging comes later. See, this is ice cold water.
Lockwood : It'll burn like hell when it hits his lungs,
UNK: but he won't lose consciousness right away.
Lockwood : But all this stops when you tell me how much the cops know!
Castle : Lockwood would have been one of the last numbers she called.
UNK: Got it. 917-555-0176.
Beckett : - I need a GPS... - Castle, you've done it again.
UNK: That guy's going to spot a SWAT team from a block away,
Beckett : warn Lockwood.
Beckett : We call in the cavalry and they're both dead.
