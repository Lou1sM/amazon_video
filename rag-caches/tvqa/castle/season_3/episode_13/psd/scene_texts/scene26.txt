UNK: Oh, you were adorable.
UNK: Did your mom take these?
Beckett : Yeah, about three weeks before she died.
UNK: Oh, I don't get to see you in action?
Beckett : Trust me, Castle, it was not pretty.
Castle : Now I have to see it.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: What?
UNK: Uh...
UNK: There's 24 exposures on this roll, but there's only 20 pictures.
Beckett : What is it?
UNK: I don't know. An empty street?
Beckett : Castle, this is where my mom was murdered.
Beckett : I don't understand.
Beckett : These pictures were developed a week before she was killed.
Castle : Why would she be taking photos of that alley?
Beckett : I don't know.
UNK: I always thought it was just a convenient place for the killer to attack.
Beckett : I mean, it was dark, it was secluded...
UNK: But what if there was more to it than that?
Castle : What if she was looking into something that happened in that alley
Castle : when they killed her?
Beckett : Well, I'd have to go into the old archives and reports,
Beckett : and Captain Montgomery won't let me back in the precinct right now.
Castle : I'll go.
UNK: Hal Lockwood. Male, white, 32.
Ryan : Record's clean.
Ryan : According to this, Lockwood's never had so much as a traffic citation.
