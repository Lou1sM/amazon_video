Castle : They mistakenly killed an undercover Fed named Bob Armen.
Castle : To cover their asses,
UNK: they pinned Armen's murder on Pulgatti.
Beckett : And then, seven years later, my mom and a group of her colleagues
Beckett : tried to put together an appeal for Pulgatti.
Beckett : Now the cops knew that if the case got overturned,
Beckett : they would all be exposed.
Beckett : So they hired Dick Coonan to kill all of them.
Montgomery : And Raglan wrote off their homicides as random gang violence.
UNK: And that would've been the end of it,
Castle : but Raglan found out he was dying,
UNK: decided he wanted to come clean.
Castle : So they had to silence him, too.
Beckett : Pulgatti said that there were three kidnappers in that van.
Beckett : That means there's at least two conspirators out there now.
Ryan : And we already know who one of them is.
Ryan : Raglan's old Academy buddy, Gary McCallister.
Montgomery : How do you know that?
Esposito : I pulled the dispatcher's log from the archives.
Esposito : There was another unit backing Raglan when he arrested Pulgatti.
UNK: A one-man patrol unit,
Esposito : Officer Gary McCallister.
UNK: Get that son of a bitch.
Beckett : Vulcan Simmons had nothing to do with this.
Beckett : But as a former cop, you knew that he fit the part,
Beckett : and so you used him to throw us off.
Beckett : When the truth is that you and Raglan
Beckett : were up to your necks in murder and kidnappings.
UNK: Listen, it's easy for you to sit in judgment now,
UNK: but you weren't there.
UNK: We did what we thought we had to do.
