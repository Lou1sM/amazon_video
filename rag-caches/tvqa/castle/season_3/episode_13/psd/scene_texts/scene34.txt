UNK: You talk to Montgomery?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : Castle, there's something I need you to do.
Castle : Name it.
Montgomery : Go home.
Castle : Forget it.
Castle : Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Beckett : Look, I signed up for this when I put that badge on.
Beckett : You didn't. It's not your fight.
Castle : The hell it isn't.
Castle : I don't hang around you just to annoy you.
UNK: I don't ride out to murder scenes in the middle of the night
Castle : to satisfy some morbid curiosity.
Castle : If that's all this was, I would've quit a long time ago.
UNK: Well, then, why do you keep coming back, Rick?
Castle : Look, I may not have a badge,
Castle : unless you count the chocolate one Alexis gave me for my birthday.
