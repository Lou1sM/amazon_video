Beckett : about my mother's case.
Beckett : Nobody knows it better than I do.
Montgomery : Yeah, but I know you.
UNK: You're gonna pick up those scissors, run around the house with them.
Montgomery : But I'm telling you now, walk don't run.
Montgomery : Go where the evidence leads, not the other way around.
Montgomery : - Do you read me? - Yes, sir.
Beckett : Loud and clear.
UNK: Crime Scene Tech : Found a bullet embedded in the booth,.338 Magnum.
UNK: Crime Scene Tech : Fairly exotic, anti-personnel round.
Beckett : Can you show me the trajectory?
UNK: Crime Scene Tech : Yeah, it's right over here.
UNK: All right, I make the building across the street, 4th floor.
UNK: Esposito?
Esposito : Yeah, I'll lock it down.
UNK: Somebody had to have seen something in there.
Beckett : Ryan, I am betting that Raglan's murderer followed him here.
Beckett : Can you check with his neighbors,
Beckett : see if anyone was hanging around his place this morning?
Ryan : - You got it. - Thanks.
Beckett : - Hey. - Hey.
Beckett : You good?
Castle : Yeah, I think I got it all off my hands.
Beckett : It's different when it happens right in front of you.
UNK: You're close enough to watch the lights go out.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : When I saw the blood on your shirt, I thought you'd been shot.
UNK: Uh, I'm gonna go to the 12th.
