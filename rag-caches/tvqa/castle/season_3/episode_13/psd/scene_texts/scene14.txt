Beckett : witness intimidation.
UNK: And then it looks like it just dries up.
Beckett : Nobody's booked him in years.
Castle : So what does that mean? He found religion?
Esposito : Means he got smart. Swimming in deeper waters.
Ryan : Guess he's come a long way since Washington Heights.
Beckett : Wait, what? You said Washington Heights?
Ryan : Back in the day, Simmons used to run the drug trade in Washington Heights.
Beckett : My mom and a group of her colleagues,
Beckett : they put together this campaign called Take Back The Neighborhood.
Beckett : They were trying to get drug dealers off the streets
Ryan : in Washington Heights.
Ryan : With Simmons running all the dope in that neighborhood,
UNK: that campaign would've cost him.
UNK: That hitman, Coonan, we know that he was into dope.
Ryan : Maybe that's how Simmons got in contact with him.
Castle : So Simmons hires Coonan to kill them all,
Castle : including your mother,
Castle : and pays his old friend Raglan
Castle : to write off their homicides as random gang violence.
