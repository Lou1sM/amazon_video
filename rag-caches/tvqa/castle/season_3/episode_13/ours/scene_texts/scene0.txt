UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : I remember you, Detective Raglan.
Raglan : Listen, I...
Raglan : We need to talk about your mother's case.
Raglan : There's something you don't know.
UNK: Detective Kate Beckett : - Beckett. - Hey.
Castle : Come on in.
Beckett : Can we talk for a second?
Beckett : That's him.
UNK: Lady, what part of "no cops" didn't you understand?
Beckett : He's not a cop.
Raglan : Who the hell is he, then?
Beckett : He's someone I trust.
Waitress : More coffee?
Raglan : Thank you.
Beckett : Tell me what I don't know about my mom's murder.
Raglan : Everybody drinks their coffee out of cardboard cups these days.
Raglan : Or those plastic travel mugs. But there's...
Raglan : There's something about the way ceramic warms your hands.
Raglan : It's weird,
Raglan : the things you notice.
Raglan : I just got the long face from the doc.
UNK: Lymphoma.
Raglan : Six months.
UNK: I'm sorry to hear about that.
Raglan : Every year around the holidays,
UNK: When I was a kid, I remember Jacob Marley scared the hell out of me,
UNK: forced to drag that chain around in the next world.
UNK: "I wear the chain I forged in life."
UNK: "I made it link by link."
Raglan : I hid a lot of sins behind my badge,
UNK: and now I gotta carry them.
Raglan : But your mother's case, that one weighs a ton.
UNK: Why?
Beckett : Because you wrote it off as random gang violence
Beckett : when you knew it wasn't?
Raglan : I did what I was told.
Raglan : And I kept quiet because I was afraid.
Raglan : About a year ago, there was a hostage standoff in your precinct.
UNK: You killed a hitman named Dick Coonan.
UNK: It was a big deal in the papers.
Raglan : People noticed.
Beckett : Who hired Coonan to kill my mom?
Raglan : You need some context here.
Raglan : This thing started about 19 years ago,
UNK: back before I ever knew who Johanna Beckett was.
Raglan : Nineteen years ago, I...
Raglan : I made a bad mistake,
Raglan : and that started the dominoes falling.
UNK: And one of them was your mom.
Beckett : Everybody on the ground, now!
Beckett : Back away from the window! Away from the window!
Castle : You're hit!
Beckett : I'm fine. It's not my blood.
UNK: One Lincoln 40. I have shots fired on 4th and Main.
UNK: I need backup and an ambulance.
