Castle : That was amazing.
Castle : The way you knocked him out, I mean...
Beckett : Let's go.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Okay!
Ryan : Don't tell this jack hole anything.
Esp : I'm sorry, bro. I can't watch this.
Esp : Listen to me.
Esp : You're too late.
Esp : The cops already know all about me and your mom.
Lockwood : Shoot out one of his kneecaps.
Beckett : No, no!
UNK: No, hey!
UNK: No! Come on!
UNK: You okay? - Huh?
Castle : Never better.
Beckett : Hey there, Chuck Norris.
Beckett : How's the hand?
UNK: Excruciating.
UNK: Mmm.
Castle : How's Ryan and Esposito?
UNK: Mild hypothermia. Wounded pride.
Beckett : Guess which one will heal first?
Raglan : Thank you
Beckett : for having my back in there.
UNK: Always.
Beckett : We booked you as John Doe.
Beckett : You sure as hell aren't Hal Lockwood.
Beckett : Who hired you?
Beckett : I put a lot of people in this place.
Beckett : Some of them want to kill me.
Beckett : Others, never been treated so fairly in their lives.
UNK: And so they form this attachment to me.
UNK: It's like I'm their favorite school teacher.
Beckett : Some of those people might visit you while you're in here.
Beckett : Like the ghosts that visit Scrooge.
Beckett : And after some time with them, you might find yourself a changed man.
Beckett : So I will be back here week after week
Beckett : to ask you who hired you
UNK: till that miracle occurs.
