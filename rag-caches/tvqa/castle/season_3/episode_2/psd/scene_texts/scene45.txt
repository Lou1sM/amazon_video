Beckett : And she starts doing her usual research to prove her theory.
Beckett : And all of this investigation leads her right back to Nick Johnston.
Castle : She had it all worked out.
Castle : Right up until that awkward moment where Nick Johnston stabbed her
Beckett : in the neck with an ice pick and fed her to the couch.
UNK: Nick Johnston : You've got the wrong guy. I didn't kill that psychic.
Beckett : We know she came to see you.
UNK: Yeah, she said she needed to talk to me in private.
UNK: Said it was urgent, had something to do with my wife.
Nick : So I punched out early and went uptown to her office.
Beckett : And what did you do when you got there?
Nick : Nothing. The door was locked. I pounded on it for 10 minutes.
Nick : Nobody answered. I figured she was blowing me off, so I went home.
Beckett : That's a pretty convenient story.
Nick : It's the truth.
Beckett : Okay, why don't we start talking about Emilio Casillas?
Nick : What about him?
UNK: You knew that he was sleeping with your wife.
Nick : They thought they were being so careful, but yeah, I knew.
Beckett : So what did you do?
UNK: Nothing.
Beckett : Seriously, Nick?
Beckett : Do you actually expect me to believe that you just sat by
Beckett : and let your boss take your wife away from you?
Beckett : Do you think I'm that dumb?
Castle : She's not that dumb.
Nick : I guess it doesn't matter now. I...
Nick : When I found out, I went to Emilio and I asked him to stop seeing her.
Castle : And what happened?
