Castle : what did Penny say about Alexander?
Beckett : Nothing. Just some silly stuff that didn't really make any sense.
UNK: Why?
Castle : Because my middle name is Alexander.
Beckett : I thought your middle name was Edgar.
Castle : Been perusing the personal section
Castle : of the Richard Castle website again, have we?
Castle : No, I changed my middle name to Edgar, for Edgar Allan Poe,
Castle : back when I changed my last name to Castle.
Castle : My given name is Richard Alexander Rodgers.
Castle : What a coincidence, huh?
Castle : Well, I think that was a lovely service.
Castle : And, if I may say, your speech was the best.
