Beckett : What do you mean?
UNK: Cody Donnelly told me he had proof that Vivien was a customer
Adams : in the same bar where I took Amber that day.
Adams : So she saw me, all right. With her own eyes.
Adams : There was nothing psychic about it. Nothing.
UNK: So you figured if you could prove that Vivien was a fraud,
Beckett : that maybe people would believe that you hadn't killed your wife as well.
Adams : I'm an innocent man.
Adams : But thanks to Vivien, everyone in the state believed that I killed my wife.
Adams : She got a book deal.
