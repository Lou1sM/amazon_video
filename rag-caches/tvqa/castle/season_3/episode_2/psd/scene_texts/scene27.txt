Martha : And now they want me to give the eulogy.
Martha : I don't think I can.
Martha : Oh, Richard.
UNK: - Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I know.
UNK: There she is! All right, I see her! Go get her!
Castle : Vivien Marchand, you remember me?
Beckett : Is that the footage from Cody Donnelly?
UNK: Yeah. He's waiting for you in interrogation.
Esposito : Where's Castle?
Beckett : He had some personal issues he had to deal with. What have we got?
UNK: It's going just like Steve Adams says.
UNK: Vivien comes out, he gets in her face...
UNK: She gets in the cab.
UNK: And we get a partial on the license plate.
Ryan : I'll run it down, see if I can find out where the taxi dropped her off.
Beckett : Turn it off. Turn it off.
Penny : Detective Beckett?
Beckett : Hi, Penny, what are you doing here?
Penny : Is there somewhere we could talk privately?
Castle : What's wrong? Did you remember something?
Penny : No, it's not that.
Penny : I'm afraid I wasn't completely honest with you the other day.
Penny : The fact is, I have a little bit of what my mother did.
Penny : Sometimes I have dreams that are meaningful.
Penny : Last night, I had a dream about you.
UNK: Okay.
