UNK: So, you brought your own bottle of wine with you, then?
Marina : No, Mother went out to the liquor store and brought us a bottle.
UNK: She was gone about 20 minutes.
Beckett : And what time was that?
UNK: 5 : 15, maybe. What's this all about?
Beckett : Paula, we went to the liquor store.
Beckett : You didn't buy that bottle of wine at 5 : 15.
Beckett : According to this receipt, you bought it at 3 : 12.
Beckett : And at the same time, you bought an ice pick.
Beckett : I don't understand.
Beckett : You bought that bottle of wine and then you put it aside.
