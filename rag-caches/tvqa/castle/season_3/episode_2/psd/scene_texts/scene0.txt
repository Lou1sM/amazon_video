Martha : Oh! Hello!
UNK: Shouldn't you be in school already?
Alexis : School doesn't start for another hour.
Castle : Yeah, if you were hoping to do the walk of shame in private,
Castle : you're out of luck.
Martha : Don't be silly.
Martha : I just didn't realize how early it was.
Martha : I have been a bit distracted this morning.
UNK: Do you mean distracted,
Castle : or hypnotized by that giant rock on your finger?
UNK: Wow! Did Chet Palaburn propose?
Castle : Alexis, I think it's about time we start calling him Uncle Chet.
UNK: No, wait a minute. Wait a minute, you two.
UNK: I am not engaged, all right?
Martha : Yes, Chet did propose last night,
Martha : and I told him, you know, I needed time to think about it.
Martha : And he insisted I keep the ring while I make up my mind. So...
Castle : Smart man. Diamonds can be very persuasive.
UNK: I can hear it now whispering, "Keep me.
UNK: "Keep me."
Martha : Unfortunately, now that Chet has upped the ante, as they say,
Martha : I'm going to have to decide whether I'm in or I'm out.
