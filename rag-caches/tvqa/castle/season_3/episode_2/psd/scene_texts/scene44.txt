Castle : - Yeah. - Yeah.
Ryan : That is until you see the picture.
Ryan : This is from Vivien's research.
Ryan : This is Toni in the red dress, and Emilio next to her,
Ryan : at the company's last Christmas party.
Ryan : Pretty cozy, huh?
Castle : Where did she get this?
Ryan : There's a bulletin board at the Casillas' vitamin factory,
Ryan : where employees post pictures. She could have taken it from there.
Beckett : So Vivien suspects that Emilio is a cheater.
Beckett : She gets a hold of his autopsy file,
Beckett : starts thinking that maybe his cheating got him killed.
