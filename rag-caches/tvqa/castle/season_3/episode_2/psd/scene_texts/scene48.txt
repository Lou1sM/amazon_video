Beckett : Ignore him.
Beckett : So, Paula and Marina Casillas.
Beckett : If they knew that Emilio was cheating, that would be motive.
Castle : Maybe they found out that Vivien was investigating his death.
Beckett : But they were Vivien's clients.
Beckett : Why would murderers go to a psychic for closure?
Ryan : They also have an alibi for the evening Vivien was killed.
Ryan : Uniforms canvassed the restaurant where they were dining with friends.
UNK: They were there from 5 : 00 p.m. till after 7 : 00.
Beckett : Was this restaurant anywhere near Vivien's office?
