Ryan : - You think she really... No.
Ryan : Yeah, me neither.
Beckett : Hey, Lanie. What do we got?
Lanie : We've got cause of death, blood loss and asphyxiation.
Lanie : And I'm officially putting the time of death
UNK: between 5 : 00 and 7 : 00 p.m. on Monday evening.
Beckett : So that rules out Albert Moreno.
Beckett : What else?
Lanie : There were no scratches on the ice pick blade.
Lanie : It was brand new. Probably bought special just for the occasion.
Lanie : And her cell phone was in her hand.
Lanie : She may have tried to dial for help before she expired.
Lanie : The digits match the beginning of her daughter's phone number,
UNK: 1-7-1-8-5-5...
UNK: 7-1-8-5.
Castle : Those are the numbers from the letter.
Castle : They're in a different order, but those are the same numbers!
UNK: Oh, go on. Go on, say coincidence.
UNK: Coincidence.
Castle : I'm just saying it's irrefutable. That's all.
UNK: It is not irrefutable, Castle.
Beckett : As a matter of fact, it is completely refutable.
Castle : Okay. Go on. Refute me.
Beckett : Okay, how about this?
Beckett : Vivien is dialing her daughter's number.
Beckett : Our killer comes in, stabs her in the neck, picks up the phone,
Beckett : drops it into the sofa after her
Beckett : and then puts the numbers into the letter
Beckett : along with the rest of the fake predictions.
UNK: Refuted.
Castle : No one types a number into a cell phone, anymore.
Esposito : Preliminaries on the letter aren't giving us much.
Esposito : There are no usable prints and no DNA.
UNK: And the pick up at the mail drop in Vivien's building is 6 : 00 p.m.
Beckett : Time enough for the killer to have written it and mailed it
Beckett : after she was dead.
Castle : But why? Why go through all that trouble?
Beckett : To keep us spinning wild theories and chasing after men dressed in black
Beckett : instead of following hard evidence.
