Beckett : An affair? Ms. Johnston, did Vivien ever talk to you about murder?
Toni : No. She just told me she knew how I had cheated on Nick,
Toni : my husband, and then she asked me a lot of questions about him.
Castle : What kind of questions?
Toni : She asked if he had a temper, and if I felt safe.
Toni : She was sure Nick did know about the affair.
Toni : Vivien said the spouse always knows.
