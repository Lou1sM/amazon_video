Ryan : On it. Vivien's one o'clock Monday clients are here.
UNK: They say they got a good look at the dark-haired guy who was in her office.
UNK: Their names are Paula and Marina Casillas.
UNK: Casillas. It's a good name.
Castle : Hard to possessive pluralize, though.
UNK: The Casillas-es-es car has broken down.
Castle : So they will be late for the symphony.
UNK: The Casillas-es-es... Casillas-es-es.
UNK: They're waiting for you in the lounge.
UNK: All right. Thanks.
UNK: Marina Casillas : Usually we're her last clients on Monday.
