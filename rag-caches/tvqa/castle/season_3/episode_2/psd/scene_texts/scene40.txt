Beckett : That's probably where he received the fatal dose.
Castle : So, Nick Johnston figures out his wife is sleeping with his boss...
UNK: - Mmm-hmm. ...and he poisons him.
UNK: And then Nick discovers that Vivien's on to him, and kills her, too.
UNK: Hey. So I just spoke to Nick Johnston's foreman.
UNK: He said that Nick clocked out early the day that Vivien died.
UNK: At 5 : 00.
UNK: But his wife said he didn't get home till at least 7 : 00.
UNK: That would've been plenty of time for him to get to Vivien's office,
Beckett : murder her, write the letter, all before the mail was picked up.
Beckett : But how did he find out that Vivien talked to Toni?
