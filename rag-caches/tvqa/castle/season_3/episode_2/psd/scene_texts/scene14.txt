Castle : Surrounded by skeptics.
Esposito : It's called being a cop, bro.
Alexis : Oh, great and powerful spirits,
Alexis : tell us, should Gram break up with Chet Palaburn?
Martha : This thing must be broken.
Martha : Well, luckily, I don't need the spirits to tell me
Martha : when it's time to say goodbye.
Martha : Goodbye, my love.
Alexis : What if you're being too hasty?
Alexis : - Relationships take work, right? - No, no, no.
Martha : Love is not about work.
Martha : Trust me, it's about passion, it's about chemistry, romance.
Castle : It's about your heart pounding faster because you can't wait to see her.
Alexis : Can either of you look back on a relationship that ended
Alexis : because the thrill was gone
Alexis : and admit that maybe you gave up on love too soon?
Alexis : Dad, you're back with your ex-wife.
Castle : Ooh! No, she's right.
UNK: Yeah, with Gina, the thrill was long, long gone,
UNK: but now, it is back with a vengeance.
Castle : Of course, it brought along its friends, high-maintenance and shopaholic.
UNK: No, I'm sorry, honey.
