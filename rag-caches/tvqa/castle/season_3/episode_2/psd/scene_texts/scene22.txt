UNK: I got seven to 10.
Beckett : And what was in it for Cody Donnelly?
Adams : He wanted me and Vivien to be on his reality show,
Castle : Oh, I love that show.
Castle : It's where people unleash their righteous fury
UNK: against those who have wronged them.
Castle : Usually ends in tears and a hug.
Adams : Cody and me, we went to her office with a camera crew.
Adams : We sat outside in the van for almost an hour.
Adams : When she finally came out, I confronted her.
Adams : I called her a fake.
Adams : Cody told me to make it big, so I did.
Beckett : And what did Vivien do?
Adams : Mostly, she freaked.
UNK: Then she got in a cab and took off.
UNK: Cody dropped me at my apartment on 2nd and 45th
Adams : and I never saw her again.
Beckett : GPS puts Adams at his apartment at the time Vivien was murdered.
Beckett : Find me some witnesses that can verify that.
Ryan : You don't trust the GPS?
Beckett : No, those things can be tampered with.
Beckett : So, Vivien told her daughter that she was gonna be at the office all afternoon,
UNK: and then at 2 : 45, she takes a cab and leaves.
Beckett : To see T.J., whoever that is.
Beckett : Let's get a hold of Steve Adams' producer, Cody Donnelly.
Beckett : I want to see him and his footage of Vivien, first thing in the morning.
Ryan : You got it.
