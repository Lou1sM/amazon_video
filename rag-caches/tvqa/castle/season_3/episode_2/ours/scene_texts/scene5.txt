Beckett : You were the last one to see her alive.
Beckett : The GPS on your anklet indicates that you were at Vivien's office
UNK: for over an hour, the day that she was killed.
Adams : Yeah, but it's not what you think.
Adams : Last week, I got a call from a guy named Cody Donnelly.
UNK: He's a reality-TV producer. He said he could help me clear my name.
Castle : How was he going to do that?
Adams : The day after my wife disappeared, Vivien Marchand told the cops
Adams : she had a vision of me in a bar with my girlfriend, Amber.
Castle : Which was true.
Adams : That I was there? Yeah.
Adams : But then she started saying she'd had other visions.
UNK: Visions that I murdered my wife, which I did not do.
Adams : But she was right once, about Amber, so everyone believed her.
Adams : Only Vivien had lied about that, too.
Beckett : What do you mean?
UNK: Cody Donnelly told me he had proof that Vivien was a customer
Adams : in the same bar where I took Amber that day.
Adams : So she saw me, all right. With her own eyes.
Adams : There was nothing psychic about it. Nothing.
UNK: So you figured if you could prove that Vivien was a fraud,
Beckett : that maybe people would believe that you hadn't killed your wife as well.
Adams : I'm an innocent man.
Adams : But thanks to Vivien, everyone in the state believed that I killed my wife.
Adams : She got a book deal.
UNK: I got seven to 10.
Beckett : And what was in it for Cody Donnelly?
Adams : He wanted me and Vivien to be on his reality show,
Castle : Oh, I love that show.
Castle : It's where people unleash their righteous fury
UNK: against those who have wronged them.
Castle : Usually ends in tears and a hug.
Adams : Cody and me, we went to her office with a camera crew.
Adams : We sat outside in the van for almost an hour.
