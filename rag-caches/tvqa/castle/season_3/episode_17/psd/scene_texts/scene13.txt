Castle : Beckett? Where is she?
Paramedic : - Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down. - Where is she?
Josh : She's gonna be fine. You're both fine. Got to you just in time.
Castle : - Josh? - Hey.
Josh : So, you're recovering from a moderate case of hypothermia.
UNK: You're gonna be a little bit sluggish for a while,
Josh : but with some warmth and some fluids you be should be all right.
Castle : I thought you were in Haiti.
Josh : Didn't go. It's gonna hurt.
Josh : Okay. Let's see if we can't get you to sit up.
UNK: All right, move slowly.
UNK: There you go.
Castle : How long was I out?
UNK: I don't know. About an hour.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : The bomb...
UNK: We searched the entire warehouse. It's gone.
Castle : How'd you find us?
Esposito : Alexis called. Said you didn't come home.
UNK: Alexis? She's supposed to be out of town.
Esposito : I guess she came back.
Esposito : We figured you were with Beckett, until Josh called.
Ryan : We thought you must be out there
Ryan : doing something incredibly stupid against orders,
Ryan : so we sent patrol units everywhere
Ryan : we figured you'd be moronic enough to go.
Ryan : Found Beckett's car, and we searched the area
UNK: until we found the light from the storage container.
Castle : Well, I'm glad my stupidity's predictable.
Castle : You pulled us out of there?
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: - So your boy's back in town. - Mmm-hmm.
Esposito : He came back.
Castle : So what does that mean to you?
Beckett : It means we have a chance.
