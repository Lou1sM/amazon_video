Alexis : I knew you wouldn't turn your phone off without leaving me a message.
Martha : Now, is this about the cab driver?
Castle : Look, I need you girls to do something, for me.
Castle : But I don't want you to ask any questions.
Castle : I want you to go to the Hamptons. I want you to stay there for the weekend.
Martha : Richard, what is this about?
UNK: Did you not... That's a question.
Castle : Look, there might be
UNK: an event that would make it very dangerous to stay in the city.
Castle : - What are you doing? - Calling Ashley.
Castle : No, no, no, no. You can't tell anybody.
Castle : Okay? You can't tell anybody.
Castle : You tell Ashley, he'll tell his parents, they'll call someone they love
UNK: and a panic will make this thing a thousand times harder to stop.
Alexis : - Dad, he's my boyfriend. - I know.
UNK: - That isn't fair, you can't... - Fair has nothing to do with it.
Castle : I need you to go. Now.
UNK: But you'll come, too?
Castle : I will when I can.
Castle : But I need you to go.
UNK: Now.
UNK: Okay. Come on. Come on.
