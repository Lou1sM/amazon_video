Castle : - Fallon? - I can't see anything.
Castle : I'm sorry.
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Castle!
UNK: Yes!
Beckett : No, you should've seen his face.
Beckett : Because he stopped,
Beckett : he looked at me,
Beckett : he grabbed all the wires, and then he just yanked them.
Ryan : All of them?
Castle : I figured one of them had to be the right one.
Montgomery : You know, the Mayor wants to give you guys a medal.
UNK: I didn't have the heart to tell him you had no clue what you were doing.
Esposito : Captain's right.
Esposito : You guys don't know how lucky you are.
UNK: Actually,
Castle : I do.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Can I talk to you two for a second?
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : I just want you two to know the US Attorney's Office
UNK: is gonna be charging them
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit terror.
UNK: But thanks to you two,
UNK: we won't have to add the murder of innocent New Yorkers to that allegation.

Beckett : Actually, I was doing my job. I don't know what the hell he was doing.
Castle : Hey. But that's true.
UNK: Listen,
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : what I do
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : is not who I am.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : It's just how I have to be.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : I hope you both understand that.
UNK: Why don't we just say it was a pleasure,
Beckett : and that we hope that we don't have to do it again.
UNK: Agent Mark Fallon : Fair enough.
Castle : If it does happen again though maybe you could just text me.
Castle : Have a code word.
UNK: "Run."
UNK: Hell of a day, huh?
Beckett : Hell of a day.
Alexis : You know,
Castle : I was thinking...
