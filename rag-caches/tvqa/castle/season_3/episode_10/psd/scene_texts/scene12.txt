UNK: Annie Swift : Pick-up Pete.
Castle : Pick-up Pete? Big hit with the ladies?
Annie : No, he drives a pick-up.
Martha : - Ah! - Gun rack?
Annie : Yeah. Regular upstate redneck.
Annie : Anyway, he said that he dropped his wallet in the booth,
Annie : so I let him in.
Annie : Next thing you know, he's got his hands all over me,
Annie : he's pushing me against the bar.
Annie : All of a sudden, the basement door pops open
Annie : and here comes Donny like Hemingway's ghost.
Annie : Guess I missed him down there, but I'm glad he showed up when he did.
Annie : He grabbed a baseball bat, chased Pete out.
UNK: He smashed his taillights, put a few dents in the pick-up for good measure
Annie : before the jackass could drive off.
