Martha : You know, maybe she's just responding to how you've changed.
Alexis : I haven't changed.
Martha : Oh, darling, please. Look at you.
Martha : You are tall, beautiful, sophisticated.
Martha : You have a glam Gram
UNK: and him and a boyfriend.
Martha : Did it ever occur to you that might be
Martha : rather intimidating to a girl from Kansas?
Alexis : Intimidated? When I asked where she got her gloves,
Alexis : she said it was a place I wouldn't go to.
Martha : Now, you took that as an affront
UNK: and she was just probably being self-deprecating.
UNK: Mmm-hmm. You know what, I think someone needs a virgin mojito.
Castle : Grab me some more mint. It's in the fridge.
Martha : Here's looking at you, kid.
Beckett : And you.
UNK: You could've told me you booby-trapped it.
Castle : Oh, yes, that's just how I protect my stash from G-men and mobsters.
Alexis : Mmm. At least help me reload them.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Reload.
UNK: Reload.
Castle : Beckett, I think I know how Donny was shot.
Beckett : Castle, CSU already swept through this entire basement,
Beckett : and we were just tucked in with my laptop.
UNK: We?
Beckett : Josh and I. He was helping me research.
