Castle : At night's end, you tally up your fruit
Castle : so you know how much to put into your tip cup
Castle : before you lock the register.
Castle : So, what happened, Brian? Donny catch you stealing?
Castle : Things get physical?
UNK: Over an extra 30 or 40 bucks?
UNK: That's not even stealing, it's skimming. Donny understood.
Beckett : The owner understood?
Brian : We'd all been family long enough,
Brian : Donny knew I had to get creative to make my rent once in a while.
Beckett : I'd like to see his office.
Brian : Sure. It's in the basement.
Brian : The basement?
Castle : I've never seen this.
Brian : No one knew it was there until the flood of '98.
Brian : Billy Pitt pulled up the old linoleum. There it was.
Castle : A hidden basement. How cool is this?
Castle : Did I say cool?
