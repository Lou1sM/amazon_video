Beckett : Pick-up Pete, a.k.a. Pete Mucha.
Beckett : He's got a couple of dismissed domestic assault charges
Beckett : and he is also the proud owner of a Remington 870 shotgun.
Beckett : And Ryan and Esposito are bringing him in now.
UNK: What do you think of "The Castillion"?
UNK: For?
Castle : The Old Haunt just reminded me of how vital tavern culture is in this town.
Castle : I thought why not open up a little tavern of my own.
UNK: So instead of buying a drink, you're gonna buy a whole bar?
Castle : - My way of giving back. - Yeah.
UNK: To your ego.
UNK: - "The Ego." Someone call the police.
UNK: Let me go, I'm perfectly fine!
Beckett : Pick-up Pete, I take it?
Esposito : Yeah. We found him getting tossed out of a bar uptown.
UNK: And just like the shotgun in his truck, he's a little loaded.
Beckett : Well, maybe a murder charge will sober him up.
UNK: Yup. Come on.
UNK: "The Castle."
UNK: Just have a wee drawbridge to let you in.
UNK: Congratulations, Pete, you're our drunkest murder suspect this year.
Ryan : And that includes St. Patrick's Day.
UNK: What did I win?
UNK: Well, that depends on you, Pete.
UNK: You know my name, too... And did you just say murder?
UNK: Your driver's license said you're from up in Cortland.
Esposito : What, they don't have any bars up there,
Esposito : or did you get eighty-sixed from them, too?
UNK: The city's where I work. You know, like drywall, like pipe-setting.
