Alexis : Can you believe my old grade school shirt still fits?
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Like a glove, yes. A shirt, no.
Castle : You look like The Incredible Hulk.
Alexis : Nice, Dad.
UNK: Yeah. That's what you get when you talk to him while he's writing.
UNK: Hmm. Well, Gracie is going to love it. It'll crack her up when she sees it.
Castle : Gracie, little cutie whose family moved off to...
Castle : I want to say Kansas?
Alexis : After fifth grade.
UNK: She e-mailed me she was coming to town to check out FIT,
Alexis : so I told her she could spend the night.
Alexis : I asked you.
Castle : Was I writing?
UNK: "Incredible Hulk?"
UNK: Gracie!
Gracie : Look at you, Greendale girl.
Gracie : Look at you.
Wife : - Hi. - Hi.
Alexis : You remember Gram and my dad?
Gracie : Sure, hey. It's been forever.
Gracie : Thanks again for letting me crash with you guys.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: So, your room in the same place?
Alexis : Yeah. Same place, same old room, you know, everything the same,
UNK: almost.
Martha : Looks like someone's not in Kansas anymore.
UNK: What happened to the little hair band and knee socks?
Castle : Ah! Beckett. Excellent timing.
