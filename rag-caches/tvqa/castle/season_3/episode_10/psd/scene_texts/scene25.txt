Castle : Anyway, a dangerous time when Prohibition was law
Castle : and bootleggers, the lawless,

Beckett : - Can you get to the point? - Yes.
Castle : Do you remember when Donny jumped up
Castle : and rescued Annie from Pick-up Pete,
Castle : she said she completely missed him
Castle : when she was down here doing her safe drop.
Beckett : It was late, she was tired. I can relate.
UNK: Or maybe he wasn't down here at all.
Castle : Buckshot wall.
Castle : Wall directly opposite.
UNK: Help me move the shelf.
Beckett : And what exactly are we hoping to find?
Castle : The truth.
Castle : Same thing Donny was hoping for.
UNK: In all the stories that Leo ever told as bar historian,
Castle : what if he saved one story just for Donny?
UNK: A story that Leo himself could never verify,
UNK: because the trapdoor to the basement wasn't discovered until after he died.
Castle : When Billy Pitt decided to sell the bar,
Castle : and T.J. McChucklenuts was going to buy it,
Castle : Donny realized he had to find out before it was too late.
