Beckett : Are you sure he was alone when you left?
UNK: Positive.
Wife : This is crazy. That guy was like a brother to me.
Castle : Even though he bought the bar out from under you?
Brian : You know about that?
Castle : I mean, he didn't even offer you to be a partner.
Castle : That doesn't sound very brotherly to me.
Brian : Hey, any beef I had with Donny was short-lived.
Brian : We hashed it out.
Castle : So now you're just stealing from him?
Martha : - What? - What?
Castle : Couldn't help but notice your trick with the fruit, Brian.
Castle : You pretend to ring up a drink, you stuff the money in the till
Castle : and you keep track of it by throwing pieces of fruit into the sink.
UNK: Cherries are ten, limes, what, twenty?
