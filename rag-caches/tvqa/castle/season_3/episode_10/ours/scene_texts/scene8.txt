Castle : These sewers are crawling with them.
Beckett : You know, I kind of figured you more for an alligator in the sewer type of guy.

UNK: That's fairly recently, too.
Castle : These bottles are caked with dust, and the empty spaces are relatively clean.

Castle : Hopefully with some prints on it.
Beckett : There's probably blood mixed in there, too,

Beckett : So someone else finds out about Donny's treasure,
Beckett : follows him down here, surprises him,
