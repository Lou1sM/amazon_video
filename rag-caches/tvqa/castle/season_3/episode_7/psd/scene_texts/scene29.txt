Beckett : Do you have any brochures?
Beckett : I'm looking for a place.
Beckett : Mine blew up.
Castle : Ten grand a pop, all over Jersey. That adds up quick.
Beckett : I don't understand why Derek was still working as a stripper
Beckett : the night that he was killed,
Beckett : if he was involved in a scam that was raking in that much money.
Castle : Because he wasn't the one raking in all the dough.
Castle : He was just the actor, hired for his looks
Castle : and his personality, to charm the investors.
Beckett : So all along, Derek sees his partner taking the money to the bank.
Castle : And when he gets in trouble with the bikers,
Castle : and suddenly, he needs cash...
Beckett : He raids the bank account for the 25 grand that he needs,
Beckett : and his partner figures it out.
Castle : Which leads to a heated confrontation
Castle : where he admits to borrowing the money, but...
Castle : But he says he's pulling out of the scam.
UNK: Beckett.
