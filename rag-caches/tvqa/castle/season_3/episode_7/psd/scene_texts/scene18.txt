Castle : What was it?
UNK: Secretary.
Castle : You'd be terrible at that.
UNK: Awful.
Castle : I'm sure many a pretty boy have walked this hall.
Castle : Doesn't take them long to realize that they're trapped
UNK: in the strangling embrace of an aging spinster.
Beckett : Maybe we should talk with her before you start writing the Lifetime movie.
UNK: Ooh! Quick casting idea, Ashton and Demi.
Beckett : NYPD. We're here to speak with Rebecca Dalton.
UNK: Attorney Michael Grant : Please come in.
UNK: I'm Ms. Dalton's attorney, Michael Grant.
UNK: Attorney Michael Grant : I'll be sitting in on the interview.
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : I bumped into Derek at a fundraiser.
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : He later admitted that he had been hired by the host
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : to mingle and encourage people to bid on the silent auction.
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : But it was too late, I already liked him.
Castle : And when you found out he was a stripper?
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : I never found out. He told me. He never hid any of that from me.
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : It gave him the freedom to pursue his acting career.
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : Audition during the day. And I respected his tenacity.
Beckett : What caused the break-up?
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : The relationship had run its course.
Beckett : That sounds like something that you would say
Beckett : when you're lying, either to yourself, or to us.
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : You don't really think I had anything to do with his death?
