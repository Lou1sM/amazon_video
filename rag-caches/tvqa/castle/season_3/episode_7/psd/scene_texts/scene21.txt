UNK: Rebecca Dalton : If they had something to do with his murder,
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : I'd have taken my decision back
UNK: Rebecca Dalton : and given him the money in a heartbeat.
Beckett : I'm gonna need to see those photos.
Ryan : The P.I. took a picture of Derek talking to this woman,
Ryan : and then he followed her to the next location.
Castle : So Derek is outside his apartment talking to "Bombshell" McGee.
Castle : What's so dangerous about that?
Beckett : Wait a minute.
Beckett : Ryan, can you pull up Derek's acting reel?
Ryan : Man. Once was bad enough.
Beckett : That's the same guy as the mug shot.
Montgomery : Billy Grimm,
Montgomery : leader of the Visi Goths motorcycle gang.
Esposito : Billy Grimm's rap sheet.
UNK: "Extortion, assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery."
Esposito : Grimm had an attempt murder warrant out.
Esposito : Apparently, some guy owed him money,
Esposito : so he chained him to the back of his bike,
Esposito : and dragged him down the L.I.E.
UNK: Why isn't this psycho, Grimm, in jail?
Castle : He was. As a matter of fact, he was caught
Esposito : because of Derek's re-enactment on the show.
Esposito : But the guy he chained to his bike
Esposito : had a change of heart, refused to testify.
Esposito : So, Grimm was recently released from jail.
Beckett : If this guy was such a whack job,
Beckett : what was Derek doing talking to one of the members of his gang?
Ryan : I think I can answer that.
Ryan : When Grimm was arrested, a reporter asked him
Ryan : how he felt about being brought to justice by a TV show.
Ryan : He swore vengeance against those who put him in jail,
