Beckett : Derek was found shot and killed last night
Beckett : and we found one of your hairs on his clothes.
Beckett : You just admitted that the two of you were rivals.
UNK: Rivals?
UNK: Lady, I spend my days with women shoving bills down my shorts.
Hans : Do you really think I'll kill somebody over that?
UNK: That doesn't change the fact we can place you at scene of the crime.
Hans : Because of my hair?
Hans : All that proves is that we keep our costumes
Hans : in the same big closet backstage.
