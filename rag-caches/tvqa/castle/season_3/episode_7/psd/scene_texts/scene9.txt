Ryan : Anyone he didn't get along with?
UNK: People think women are catty, but from what Derek said,
Ryan : Thanks for your time.
UNK: Lloyd Saunders : Hey, if you change your mind,
UNK: Lloyd Saunders : I'll provide fangs and some hair gel.
Esposito : All of them are buff enough to be juicing,
Esposito : but none of them have long hair.
UNK: Certainly not long, blonde hair.
Beckett : Maybe these are old photos.
Ryan : It's possible they change their style based on the latest trend.
Ryan : Maybe the Fabio look is making a comeback.
Beckett : Well, there's one surefire way to find out.
Beckett : Oh, Castle.
UNK: Camille Roberts : I can't believe you got dressed up for this.
Castle : Tell me again why Ryan and Esposito couldn't come with you?
Beckett : We all agreed as Volunteer Assistant Homicide Detective,
Beckett : you could really sink your teeth into this avenue of investigation.
Beckett : And they called "not it."
Castle : You know, ever since I've been following you
Castle : I've been dreaming of the day you'd say,
Castle : "Let's go to the strip club and get this dirt bag."
Castle : Just never imagined it would feel like this.
Beckett : Let me know if you need any singles.
Ryan : looking for his big break.
Ryan : Dreams of making it in the Apple.
Ryan : What does he get for his trouble?
Ryan : The city chews him up and spits him out.
Ryan : Doesn't seem right, man.
Esposito : Damn right, it doesn't seem right.
