Beckett : if we just ask Rebecca a few questions tomorrow morning.
Castle : It's good, though, right?
Ryan : Yeah, I liked it. Yeah. It's cool. Yeah.
Castle : Are you guys celebrating with root beer floats and nobody told me?
Alexis : I wish.
Alexis : They narrowed the part of Sandy down to Kelly Burton and yours truly.
Alexis : We're taking a little break, but I'm really nervous.
Martha : That's why we're running lines in costume.
Martha : Tomorrow it'll be second nature.
UNK: I see you've dug up your time capsule to resurrect those pants.
Hans : I will have you know,
Martha : I had some of my best memories happen in these pants.
UNK: And... Eww!
Alexis : I'm off to bed. Big day tomorrow.
Martha : Okay, darling. Sleep well.
UNK: Oh!
Martha : Whatever happens, I am so proud of her. She is fearless.
Castle : You know, Mother,
Castle : I think you're a really good influence on Alexis.
Martha : What's with you, kiddo? Fever? Delirium?
Castle : No, I'm serious. You have always been dedicated.
