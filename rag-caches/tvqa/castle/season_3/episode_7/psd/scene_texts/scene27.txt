UNK: Bert Kramer : Can I help you?
Beckett : NYPD. Who's in charge here?
Castle : I am.
UNK: I'm a developer, Bert Kramer.
Beckett : We're here about Jesse Mandalay. Do you know him?
UNK: Unfortunately.
UNK: And if I ever see that guy again, I'm gonna bust him in the jaw
UNK: Bert Kramer : for all the crap he put me through.
Castle : Let me guess, he took advantage of you.
UNK: Damn right. He tried to sell my frigging property like it was his.
UNK: Billy Grimm : Showed up here, claiming to be a real estate agent.
UNK: Bert Kramer : He had this rap about all these properties he's sold.
Beckett : And you gave him access to the building?
UNK: Bert Kramer : Well, he wanted to bring a caravan of clients through,
UNK: Bert Kramer : and he insisted it be on a Sunday, so, I gave him the lockbox codes.
Castle : How did you find out he wasn't legit?
UNK: Bert Kramer : Ever since that day,
UNK: Bert Kramer : I got people showing up saying they got the Mandalay deal,
UNK: Bert Kramer : and threatening to sue.
