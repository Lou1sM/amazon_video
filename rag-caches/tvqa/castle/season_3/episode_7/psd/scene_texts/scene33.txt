Castle : You should stitch that onto a pillow.
Castle : Oh! Hey, sweetie. Do we have a Sandra Dee in our midst?
Alexis : I didn't get the part.
UNK: Oh.
Martha : Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
UNK: Honey.
Martha : This is the best thing that has ever happened to you.
Martha : Rejection is the bedrock of a great acting career.
Martha : Until an actor has suffered, he hasn't really lived.
Alexis : - Thanks, Gram. - You're welcome.
Martha : And besides, auditions are like men.
Martha : There's another one right around the corner.
Castle : Where are you going?
Martha : We need ice cream to ease the pain. Stat!
Martha : I'm going to the corner store.
Castle : I'm sorry, sweetie.
Alexis : Can I admit something?
UNK: Always.
Alexis : Going up against Kelly
Alexis : made me realize I didn't really want the part.
Alexis : I could see how hungry she was, and I didn't want to disappoint Gram,
Alexis : but I don't love it the way she does.
UNK: Well, maybe it's not "in your bones," as Gram would say.
Castle : I am proud of you for trying.
Alexis : Thanks, Dad. And there's a silver lining.
Alexis : After the announcement,
Alexis : the drama teacher offered me stage manager.
Alexis : It's way more my style and I get to keep all my after-school clubs.
Castle : My little overachiever.
Castle : Well, congratulations on not getting the part.
