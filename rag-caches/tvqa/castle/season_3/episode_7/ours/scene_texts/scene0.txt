UNK: - Ho! Ha! Muh-mum-mum-ma! - Ho! Ha! Muh-mum-mum-ma!
UNK: - Ho! Ha! Muh-mum-mum-ma! - Ho! Ha! Muh-mum-mum-ma!
UNK: Martha/alexis : - Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! - Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
UNK: Whoo!
Castle : I had a dream.
Castle : I was floating on a lily pad
Castle : and the Swedish Bikini Team
UNK: - Oh. That must have been lovely. - Yeah.
Martha : Why are you telling us this?
Castle : Well, because of you my Swedish paradise
Castle : turned into a wailing cat shelter.
Alexis : We're doing voice exercises to strengthen abdominal breathing.
UNK: At 5 : 00 a. m?
Martha : Preparation is the foundation
UNK: of an inspired audition. Ha-ha!
Alexis : I mentioned to Gram last night
UNK: Oh! The old "Gram goes overboard because acting is in your bones" routine.
UNK: Apparently.
Castle : Yeah. Yeah.
Castle : Rookie move, telling her about the audition.
Alexis : I wasn't sure I'd have time with all my other clubs,
UNK: so I thought it might be fun.
Alexis : I didn't know she'd wake me up when it was still dark outside.
Martha : An actor learns to make sacrifices for his craft.
Martha : Besides, we'll all have plenty of time to sleep when we're dead.
Castle : Oh! Speaking of dead...
UNK: Castle.
Castle : No, don't be silly. Of course I was up.
UNK: What's the big hurry? The victim's not going anywhere, right?
Beckett : This one's different. Lanie.
Lanie : Heard we got an officer down.
UNK: Yeah, that's the word.
Castle : Who is it?
Beckett : Don't know, but a cab driver called 9-1-1
Beckett : after he parked and stopped for a smoke.
Lanie : Let's see.
Lanie : Single gunshot wound to the chest,
Lanie : and our guy isn't wearing his Kevlar.
Beckett : Mind if I step in there for a sec?
UNK: He's from the 116th in Queens.
UNK: This is an old-style badge, though.
Castle : Maybe he's old school.
Castle : Didn't want to give up the badge he built his career on.
Lanie : Castle, he's mid-20s.
Castle : You ever heard of a brilliant doctor named Doogie Howser?
Beckett : It's fake.
Castle : That's tequila.
Castle : It's cheap tequila.
Castle : And he needed a refill.
Beckett : So, a squirt gun and an old badge.
Beckett : Clearly, he's not a cop.
Castle : Maybe he was impersonating one to prey on vulnerable women.
Beckett : Armed with a tequila pistol?
UNK: Actually,
Lanie : I think women were preying on him.
Castle : Tear-away pants.
Beckett : He's a stripper.
Beckett : Not finding any ID,
UNK: but he does have a car.
UNK: Of all the cases in this city, and it's a big city,
