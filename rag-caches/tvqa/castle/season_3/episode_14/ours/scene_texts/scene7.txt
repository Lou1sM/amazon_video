Esposito : Competing dealer got blown up last year,
UNK: but they didn't have enough evidence to convict.
Castle : So Oz shoots Hixton for ordering a beatdown,
UNK: and then attempts to barbecue the Page brothers
Castle : to complete his revenge.
UNK: All right, let's go pick up Oz.
Esposito : Yeah, well, that's gonna be difficult.
Esposito : According to Vice, Oz pretty much operates off grid.
Esposito : Only time he's on is when he's dealing
UNK: out of word-of-mouth night clubs.
Esposito : And even there, he's got a network
Esposito : of bouncers, waiters and patrons as lookouts.
Esposito : Oz catches one whiff of bacon and he vanishes into thin air.
Castle : There's gotta be some way to slip under the radar.
UNK: What?
Beckett : I think we're gonna need your Ferrari.
UNK: Mother.
Martha : Oh, my. Look at you. Oh, you look gorgeous.
Castle : I'm just gonna grab my keys and change.
Martha : You two going out on a date?
Beckett : Oh. No. We're just doing a little undercover work.
Beckett : - So, how are you doing? - Uh...
Martha : I've been better.
Beckett : Castle told me that you decided to give the money back.
Martha : Yeah, well, I tried. Chet's kids refused to take it.
