UNK: The Bowery soup kitchen. I think. It's where we were supposed to meet.
Beckett : Did he have problems with anyone there that you know of?
UNK: Noreen Hixton : No one in particular.
UNK: Noreen Hixton : It was a pretty rough crowd.
Castle : All my years as a mystery writer point to one unequivocal killer.
Castle : The butler did it.
Martha : - Oh! - Come on!
Castle : How many cases have we actually had
UNK: where there's a butler as a potential suspect?
Castle : It would be a crime if he didn't do it.
Beckett : And then he shows up the next morning and calls the cops?
Castle : - Pretty clever, right? - Well...
Castle : Speaking of clever, I noticed at the crime scene
Castle : you never mentioned what you would do if you won the lottery.
Beckett : No, I didn't.
Castle : Is that because it's embarrassing? Ooh! Scandalous.
Beckett : I actually haven't really thought about it, Castle.
Castle : So not embarrassing or scandalous, just secretive.
UNK: Bad news travels fast.
UNK: Jim Van-eps : When he first started coming here, he'd hand out $ 100 bills
UNK: Jim Van-eps : like they were nothing.
UNK: It got so bad, I had to ask him to stop.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Jim Van-eps : Well, we were attracting a bad element.
UNK: Jim Van-eps : Still, I'd see Mr. Hixton sneak money
UNK: Jim Van-eps : to a pregnant woman or a homeless kid.
UNK: Jim Van-eps : It was a compulsion for him,
UNK: Jim Van-eps : like he had to give it away 'cause he didn't deserve it somehow.
Castle : Winner's guilt.
Castle : It's actually quite common with lottery recipients.
Beckett : Did anything suspicious happen with Mr. Hixton
Beckett : when he was here last night?
UNK: Jim Van-eps : Now that you mention it, yeah.
