UNK: Reginald Easley : But the truth is I was scared his bad luck would become mine.
UNK: He won over 100 million in the lottery.
Castle : One could hardly consider that bad luck.
UNK: Reginald Easley : His marriage failed, his daughter fell into drugs
UNK: Reginald Easley : and he was just gunned down in his own apartment.
UNK: Reginald Easley : That, sir, is the universe... What did you call it?
UNK: Oh, yes, "Correcting a karmic injustice."
Beckett : What do you mean?
UNK: Reginald Easley : The winning lottery ticket.
UNK: Reginald Easley : Hixton let it slip one night
UNK: Reginald Easley : after a little too much time with the bottle.
UNK: Reginald Easley : He always played the same numbers,
UNK: Reginald Easley : the dates he and his wife met and were married.
UNK: One, three, 95, and 10, 24, 98.
Castle : None of those numbers are on the ticket.
UNK: Reginald Easley : All the misery that came from the money?
UNK: Reginald Easley : Hixton believed it was because he stole the ticket.
Montgomery : So you think Hixton was murdered because he stole the ticket.
Castle : - No. - Yes.
Castle : Come on.
Castle : I mean, it was worth a fortune.
Beckett : Easley had every reason to make up that story.
Beckett : And even if those weren't Hixton's regular numbers,
Beckett : it still doesn't prove that he stole the ticket.
Castle : But the theft explains so much about Hixton's behavior.
Castle : The director of the soup kitchen
Castle : said that Hixton compulsively gave away his money
Castle : like he felt he didn't deserve it. I called it winner's guilt,
Castle : but what if it was another kind of guilt entirely?
Beckett : Okay, fine, let's say that you're right.
Beckett : Let's say that Hixton stole the ticket.
Beckett : There's still no evidence suggesting that that contributed to his death.
Castle : You're the first person to tell me
Castle : that there are no coincidences in a murder investigation.
