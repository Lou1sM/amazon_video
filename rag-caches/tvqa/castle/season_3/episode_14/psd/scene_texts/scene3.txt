UNK: Jim Van-eps : A man was hanging around a good part of the afternoon.
Beckett : Someone you didn't know?
UNK: Jim Van-eps : I'd never seen him before. But he went right up to Mr. Hixton
UNK: when he arrived at 6 : 00 like he knew him, you know?
UNK: Jim Van-eps : A few minutes later, they left and never came back.
Beckett : Do you think you could describe him to a sketch artist?
Castle : So, our mystery man goes to the soup kitchen,
Castle : waits for Hixton, and then takes him where?
Castle : He wasn't killed for another six hours.
Beckett : And why wait? I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton,
Beckett : why not just take him home and empty his safe?
Castle : And then there's Hixton's gun.
Castle : Why did he need it, and where did he get it?
Beckett : Well, according to CSU, nowhere legal.
Beckett : The serial numbers were filed off the gun,
Beckett : and Hixton's prints were on the bullets in the chamber,
Beckett : which means he loaded it himself.
Esposito : Found our lottery winner's money bag.
Beckett : Where'd you find it?
Esposito : Alley behind Hixton's building.
Esposito : It was empty, but as you can see, the dye pack in the bag went off,
Esposito : and it must've gotten on our killer's hands
Esposito : because we got prints.
Esposito : Belonging to one Todd Shipley,
Esposito : a maintenance worker in Hixton's building.
Esposito : He got off right around the time that Hixton was killed.
Beckett : Yeah, but if he's a maintenance worker,
Beckett : he could've picked up the bag after the dye pack went off.
Esposito : I don't think so.
Beckett : Or he's our killer.
UNK: Todd Shipley : I swear, I found the bag on the ground,
UNK: Todd Shipley : and when I opened it, it went off in my face.
UNK: That bag was on a three-minute timer.
Ryan : Are you telling us that you
Ryan : accidentally picked it up at exactly the wrong time?
UNK: Todd Shipley : Man, I'm telling the truth!
UNK: Todd Shipley : I'd just gotten off work, stopped to get a soda
