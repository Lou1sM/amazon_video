UNK: Shawn York : I went to the late movie near my apartment.
UNK: Shawn York : They're having a Tony Jaa marathon.
UNK: Shawn York : Can I have that soda now?
Beckett : Theater clerk confirms selling York the ticket,
Beckett : and Hixton's signature on the car title is authentic.
Beckett : Who gives away their car?
Castle : Someone who can afford to buy 1,000 new ones.
UNK: So at 6 : 00, Hixton gives York his car,
UNK: and then at 8 : 00, he calls his wife and cancels dinner.
Beckett : Told her that there's something they need to talk about,
Beckett : something that they both need to deal with together.
UNK: Then he gets home at 11 : 00, and about an hour later, he's killed.
Beckett : So what was he doing in the meantime, and with whom?
Beckett : You know, the guy did like to spend money.
Castle : If he made any charges on his credit card last night,
UNK: it might give us a clue as to where he was.
Esposito : Well, if he spent any money the night he was killed, it was cash.
Esposito : There are no charges on any of his 32 credit cards.
UNK: Thirty-two credit cards?
Esposito : Yeah, one for every NFL team.
Esposito : And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Esposito : He also bought a racehorse,
UNK: a minority stake in a lingerie football team,
Esposito : and a Bentley, which is currently at the bottom of the Hudson River
Esposito : because he drove it off of a boat he was renting.
Beckett : Wow. Sounds like that money really turned Hixton
Beckett : into a different person for a little while.
Castle : Yeah, money doesn't change who you are.
