UNK: Father, you'll forgive me, but this is a murder investigation,
Beckett : and I can't base this on faith.
UNK: Hey.
Royce : It looks like you caught your killer.
Beckett : Yeah, maybe.
Royce : So, was he trying to start the zombie apocalypse?
Castle : Mock all you want. Our good Father knows what that paper is.
Royce : Oh, man. Hey, I found this picture in my closet.
UNK: I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
Castle : Oh! Look at you, all shiny and bright.
Beckett : What did I tell you about feeding the animals?
Royce : Listen, I just stopped by to say thanks again for the bounty assist,
UNK: and thought maybe I could buy you lunch.
