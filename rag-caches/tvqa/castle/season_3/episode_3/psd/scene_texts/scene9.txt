UNK: Aaron Low : And a friend.
Beckett : Where were you two nights ago between 9 : 00 and 11 : 00?
Low : I was at the church.
Low : We had a late service, then I went home to bed.
Low : I'm sorry, I have an appointment. So if you'll excuse me...
UNK: Father.
Castle : Those are killer shoes.
UNK: Unfortunately, those are the same shoes
UNK: that were worn by the man who killed Carver.
Beckett : And I'm certain that if we send those to the lab,
Beckett : they'll have Carver's blood all over them.
Low : Look, Deon was dead when I got there.
Beckett : Try again.
Low : Look, I swear. I found him lying in his office.
Low : I administered last rites and then I dialed 911.
Beckett : Anonymously. And then you ran.
Low : There was nothing more I could do.
Castle : Why were you there in the first place?
Low : Deon was having marital troubles, I was helping him find his way.
Low : Marital troubles?
Beckett : Are you sure you didn't go there looking for this?
Low : I don't know what that is.
UNK: Lying isn't his strong suit, a quality I like in a priest.
Low : I'm telling the truth.
UNK: Father, you left the scene of a crime,
UNK: and a man that you describe as a friend was murdered,
Beckett : if you didn't have anything to hide, you would've stayed.
Low : I was in shock.
Low : There was so much blood. All I could think to do was escape.
Beckett : Because you murdered him.
Beckett : No, because... Because of how it looked.
Low : The convicts I work with tell me horror stories about the police.
Low : About how they're framed.
Low : You know, when I found Deon like that, I panicked.
Low : Am I ashamed? Yes.
Low : But you have to believe I didn't murder anybody.
