Beckett : The night that I shot the guy who killed my mother,
Beckett : I dreamt that I was the one who was on the ground dying.
Beckett : And that you came up to me and told me to stand up.
Beckett : 'Cause there was still work to be done.
Beckett : When I woke up that morning I just wanted to call you,
UNK: but we hadn't talked since so long.
UNK: You should've called.
Royce : I never forgot.
Beckett : I'm going to catch Carver's killer, Royce.
Beckett : And then I'm going to recover Lloyd's score.
Beckett : And when I arrest you,
Beckett : you're going to realize that what you destroyed today
Beckett : was worth a hell of a lot more than money.
