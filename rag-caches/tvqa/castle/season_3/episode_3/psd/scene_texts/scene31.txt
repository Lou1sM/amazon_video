Castle : No. I made a deal and it would be wrong to break it.
Castle : But there's nothing in that deal
Castle : that prohibits me from buying myself a scooter,
Castle : and maybe letting you borrow it from time to time.
Beckett : - Are you sure? - Sure.
Castle : I can send you to the store for batteries for lightsabers.
Alexis : Thanks, Dad.
Alexis : Oh, and when you have the scooter, maybe I can borrow the car?
