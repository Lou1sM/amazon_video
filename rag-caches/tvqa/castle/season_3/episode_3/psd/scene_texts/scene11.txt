Beckett : Yeah, sure.
Ryan : So it looks like the bug from Carver's office
Ryan : was shipped from Thailand to a spy shop on Fifth Avenue.
UNK: And guess who bought it?
Beckett : Father Aaron.
Ryan : Brooke Carver, our victim's wife.
Beckett : Funny, she failed to mention that she was bugging her husband's office.
Castle : Perhaps the good Father was telling the truth
Castle : about Carver's marital problems.
UNK: Nothing says "marriage on the rocks" like electronic eavesdropping.
UNK: But does it say "murder"?
Castle : Let's ask her.
Castle : Oh, um...
Beckett : Why don't you stop by after my shift. I'll buy you a beer.
Royce : It's a date.
Brooke : We'd been fighting all the time.
Brooke : Some nights he wouldn't come home.
UNK: He always said he was sleeping at the office, but I didn't believe him.
Brooke : So I bought the bug.
Castle : You thought he was cheating on you.
Beckett : And when you heard him in action, you decided to make yourself a widow.
Brooke : No. At first I couldn't even bear to listen.
Brooke : I couldn't bear to hear him with another woman.
UNK: Then, finally, I made my sister listen with me.
UNK: But what we heard, it wasn't sex,
Brooke : it was Deon talking about how much he loved me
