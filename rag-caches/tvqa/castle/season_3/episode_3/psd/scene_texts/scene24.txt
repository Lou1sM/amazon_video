Castle : Which Brooke had bugged.
Beckett : - Seriously? - Call Ryan. Have him find Brooke.
UNK: Right.
Castle : She didn't hear him profess his undying love for her,
Castle : she heard him trying to cut her out of millions.
Beckett : And then she lied to our faces.
UNK: A marriage on the rocks, a fortune in rocks.
Castle : Two strong motives for murder.
Beckett : We showed her the map.
Castle : No wonder her hands were trembling.
Esposito : Ryan traced Brooke to Carver's office.
UNK: All right, let's go.
Random : Hey, hey, hey.
Random : What about me?
Beckett : Have a cheese puff. Uniforms are on their way.
Beckett : There's no one here. We just missed her.
Castle : She was trying to recreate the map from memory.
Beckett : Look at this.
Beckett : Notes she took while she was listening in on the bug, right here.
Castle : She heard them figure it out.
Castle : But without the map she can't find the treasure.
UNK: That's because the score could be buried anywhere.
Castle : No, it can't be.
Castle : New York is basically an island of concrete.
Castle : Lloyd would have to make sure he buried it someplace
Castle : that couldn't be torn down or dug up to make condos.
Ryan : The park, maybe?
Castle : Or a cemetery.
Castle : Didn't Brooke say Carver was being cremated?
Castle : So why does she have cemetery brochures?
Beckett : Those weren't lines on the map, those were gravestones...
UNK: Wanna bet it's buried under the gun?
Ryan : You know, if this were a horror movie, we'd be the first ones killed,
Ryan : splitting off like this.
Esposito : Yeah, except we are not a couple of top-heavy coeds out looking for fun.
UNK: We're highly-trained officers of the law
Esposito : with enough firepower to take out a horde of undead.
Ryan : Hispanic and cocky. Yeah, you'd definitely die first.
Castle : You know, if this was a horror movie...
