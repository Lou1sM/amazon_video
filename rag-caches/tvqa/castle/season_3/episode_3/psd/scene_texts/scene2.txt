Beckett : it doesn't mean that it wasn't an attempted robbery.
Beckett : I mean, these aren't Mensa members we're talking about.
UNK: Hey, Beckett, waitress at the diner in Carver's building
UNK: said that she saw Carver and one of his clients
Esposito : get into a shouting match last night.
UNK: Some skell named Random Pierce.
Castle : Somebody actually named their kid Random?
Castle : No wonder he turned to a life of crime.
Beckett : Random just did two years at Five Points Correctional.
Beckett : And a week after he got out, he was arrested for a B&E.
UNK: This sounds like a real winner.
Esposito : Waitress said that she heard him tell Carver
Esposito : that if he didn't give it back, then Random was going to take it.
