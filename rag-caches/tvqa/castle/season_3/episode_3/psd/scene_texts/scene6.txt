Stuckey : - Who are you? - Uh...
UNK: NYPD.
Ryan : Are you Clifford Stuckey?
Beckett : - Clifford Stuckey? - Yeah.
UNK: We'd like you to come downtown
Esposito : and answer some questions about your break-in.
Stuckey : You'll have to speak up, son.
Stuckey : I dropped my hearing aid down the toilet.
UNK: Oh, Beckett's gonna love him.
UNK: What?
Beckett : Mr. Stuckey, I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
UNK: I wish they had cops like you when I was getting in trouble.
Beckett : Sir, could you tell us
Beckett : what you were doing in Mr. Carver's office?
UNK: Who?
UNK: Kate Beckett : Deon Carver. He was a bail bondsman.
Beckett : He was murdered last night. We found your fingerprints in his office.
Stuckey : Oh, him.
Stuckey : What was the question?
Beckett : Mr. Carver posted bail for Random Pierce,
Beckett : the man who broke into your apartment.
Beckett : I need to know what you were doing in his office.
Stuckey : Do you believe an old dog can learn new tricks, Detective?
UNK: No.
Stuckey : Neither did I.
Stuckey : And then I got old.
Stuckey : You see, I've been a bad man most of my life.
Stuckey : And now all my friends are dead or in jail,
UNK: and I got nothing to show for my time here.
