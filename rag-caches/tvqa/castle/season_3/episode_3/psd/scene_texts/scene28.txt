Castle : What's bugging me though, is if there was no treasure,
Castle : then why make a map?
Beckett : Well, it's a big cemetery.
Beckett : Maybe he got the spot wrong.
UNK: Maybe "under the gun" was just to throw us off.
Castle : You know, if it was me, I would have left something out of the map.
Castle : Last step.
UNK: So, you think there is another map?
Castle : No. I would have kept it somewhere close to me.
Castle : Somewhere where only I knew
Castle : that it was important.
