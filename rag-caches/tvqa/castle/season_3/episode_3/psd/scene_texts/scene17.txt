Alexis : - Dad. - Hey.
Castle : What are you doing here?
Alexis : I got the money.
Beckett : - Already? - Mmm-hmm.
UNK: How?
UNK: The lightsabers.
Alexis : I found a guy on eBay willing to pay $2,000 for them.
Castle : But we had so much fun with those.
Castle : We were saving the universe one galaxy at a time.
Castle : That's what got you into fencing.
Alexis : I know, Dad, but I've outgrown them.
UNK: No, I guess... I guess you have.
Alexis : Are you mad?
UNK: No. I'm frustrated over this case.
