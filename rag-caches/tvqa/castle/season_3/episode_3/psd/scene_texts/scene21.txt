UNK: What?
Castle : When I took the picture of the two of you,
Castle : you were standing in front of the murder board.
Beckett : He has a copy of the map.
Castle : Yes, but, obviously, he can't figure it out.
Castle : That's why he was here. He wanted to see if we did.
UNK: Beckett.
Esposito : I pulled the files from the jewelry heist.
Esposito : Your boy, Royce, was part of the investigation.
Beckett : So he knew about the treasure from the start?
UNK: We have surveillance on his apartment and an APB out on his car.
UNK: What about "under the gun"? Any idea what that means?
UNK: No, not yet. There was a gun club about five blocks from the jewel heist.
Ryan : But it was torn down and turned into condominiums about 10 years ago.
UNK: All right, then. Keep looking.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : Royce, turn yourself in.
Royce : Listen, I just need you to know that I didn't mean for it to go like this.
Beckett : Did you kill Carver for the map?
UNK: Oh, come on, kid, you know me better than that.
Beckett : I don't think I do,
Beckett : because the man that I knew wouldn't betrayed me like this.
Royce : I gotta go.
Beckett : I was in love with you.
UNK: You were the only one who understood the obsession that drove me.
Beckett : Who didn't tell me that I would get over my mother's murder,
Beckett : and that she wouldn't want me to do this.
UNK: Just trying to do right by you, kid.
