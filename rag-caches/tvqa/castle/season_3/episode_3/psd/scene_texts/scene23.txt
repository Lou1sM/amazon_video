Beckett : Did I keep him on long enough?
Beckett : Uh... Um...
UNK: Yeah. We got an address.
UNK: All right. Let's go.
Castle : All that was just an act? To get a trace?
Castle : Of course.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: NYPD!
Esposito : - Clear. - Whoo!
Random : Thank God. That dude totally kidnapped me.
Beckett : Knock it off. We already know about the map.
Alexis : - Really? - Where's Royce?
Random : Out looking for my money. Looks like he betrayed all of us.
Beckett : Random, either you start telling us the truth
UNK: or Esposito's going to hang you out that window by your feet.
Random : Look, I'm a victim in all this. I bunked with a geezer
Random : who wouldn't shut up about his 10-million-dollar score.
UNK: How he'd buried it where nobody could find it, not without the map.
Random : But then I had to partner with Carver and the creepy priest,
UNK: and instead of us trying to figure out the map,
UNK: all they wanna do was argue about
Random : how un-Christian it was to cut Carver's wife out of the score.
Beckett : This argument, did it take place in Carver's office?
UNK: Yeah.
