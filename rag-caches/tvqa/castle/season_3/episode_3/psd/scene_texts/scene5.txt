Castle : What? No. What?
UNK: It's all right. He is pretty hard to resist.
Alexis : - Hey. - Yeah?
Castle : Why didn't Royce and Beckett stay partners?
UNK: She moved up and he moved down. He did his 20 and put in his papers.
UNK: I think he realized that he wasn't going to do any better than her.
Castle : You know, I think Beckett is right about this.
Esposito : This doesn't look like anything worth killing for.
Castle : Unless it's the lost secret of the Illuminatis.
Castle : Or Morse Code.
Esposito : Negative. All dashes, no dots.
Beckett : Hey, guys. Do you wanna hear something weird?
Beckett : We got a fingerprint hit from Carver's office
Beckett : on a long-time felon named Clifford Stuckey.
Castle : Stuckey. Why do I know that name?
Beckett : It's because it was Stuckey's apartment that Random broke into
Beckett : when he got out of prison.
UNK: That can't be a coincidence.
Beckett : Clifford Stuckey.
Esposito : NYPD. Open up.
