Random : Deon's dead?
Beckett : Nice try.
Beckett : You have a history of breaking and entering,
Beckett : and I have a victim whose offices were ransacked.
Beckett : And you were seen arguing with Carver three hours before he was killed.
Random : He invited me to dinner 'cause he wanted to stress
UNK: the importance of my attendance in court this morning,
UNK: and seeing as he had a 100K on the hook if I skipped.
Beckett : Which you did.
Random : My alarm clock didn't go off.
Beckett : Or you were so exhausted after killing Carver
Beckett : that you slept right through it.
Castle : Come on. Three hours after we had dinner,
UNK: I was shoplifting at Book Mart uptown.
Beckett : You threatened someone's life, and then decide to shoplift a book.
UNK: That's why I forgot to pay,
Random : I was so used to being in a prison library.
Random : I tried to tell the security dude that,
Random : but he had me in some ninja choke hold.
Random : Luckily for me,
Random : I was able to slip away before the cops came.
UNK: Sucker!
