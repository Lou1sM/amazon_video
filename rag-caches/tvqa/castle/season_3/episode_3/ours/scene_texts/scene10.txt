Castle : So why does she have cemetery brochures?
Beckett : Those weren't lines on the map, those were gravestones...
UNK: Wanna bet it's buried under the gun?
Ryan : You know, if this were a horror movie, we'd be the first ones killed,
Ryan : splitting off like this.
Esposito : Yeah, except we are not a couple of top-heavy coeds out looking for fun.
UNK: We're highly-trained officers of the law
Esposito : with enough firepower to take out a horde of undead.
Ryan : Hispanic and cocky. Yeah, you'd definitely die first.
Castle : You know, if this was a horror movie...
Beckett : Castle, focus.
Castle : There it is. There it is. Look. Yes.
UNK: Okay.
Ryan : Looks like someone's been here already.
Brooke : Drop the gun!
Royce : I can't do that.
UNK: Then we got a problem.
Beckett : You're not a cop killer, Brooke. I know you didn't mean to kill Deon.
Beckett : He just surprised you when you were looking for that map.
Brooke : To hell with that. Of course I meant to kill him.
UNK: After 10 years of putting up with his foot fetish and his snoring,
UNK: he betrays me like that? Uh-uh.
Brooke : I deserve that treasure, and I'm not leaving here without it.
Stuckey : Only one leaving with that treasure is me.
UNK: And I got the biggest gun.
Royce : Not anymore, grandpa.
Ryan : NYPD! NYPD! Drop your weapons right now!
Ryan : Drop it! Drop your weapon!
UNK: Drop it, now!
UNK: What about you, Royce? Are you willing to shoot me for that treasure?
Royce : In case you haven't noticed, kid, my gun's not pointed at you.
UNK: Well, my gun is,
UNK: and at this range I'm gonna turn her and the haircut into soup.
Ryan : You shoot, you die, gramps.
Stuckey : You think I care?
Stuckey : The only thing that's keeping me alive is that 10 million in stones.
Stuckey : Either I leave with it, or I leave in a body bag.
Beckett : Well, then maybe we should make sure the treasure's even there
Beckett : before we start shooting.
