UNK: Nope. The rest is just pizza.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: I just got through Burns' financials.
Beckett : Any activity last night?
UNK: Yeah, something odd.
UNK: At 11 : 15 p.m., he used his ATM card.
UNK: Where?
UNK: A not-so-good neighborhood about 15 blocks away from Authentic Nick's.
UNK: But here's the odd part.
UNK: He never finished the transaction.
UNK: You mean he canceled it?
Ryan : No, no. He never finished it.
Ryan : He popped in his ATM card, but then after about a minute of inactivity
Ryan : it ate his card.
UNK: It's almost as if...
Castle : Something happened.
Beckett : Get ATM surveillance. Let's find out what.
UNK: I'm gonna go to the Hall of Records tomorrow morning.
UNK: See if we can figure out what Burns was up to.
UNK: Things happen. How could he let her do it?
UNK: Well...
Castle : What happened?
Martha : Alexis decided to crash Lauren's party,
UNK: against our better judgment.
UNK: And I take it that the party crashing didn't go so well?
Alexis : None of this would have happened
Alexis : if Lauren wasn't the most conniving bitch in the entire world.
UNK: Ralph Carbone : - Whoa. - It's warranted.
Alexis : When the band was performing,
Alexis : Lauren brought Ashley up on stage with her.
Alexis : And she kissed him. In front of everyone!
UNK: Bitch!
Alexis : How could she do this to me? To Ashley?
UNK: What did Ashley do?
Alexis : He was mortified. He ran off stage and we left.
UNK: And he was apologizing a thousand times.
Alexis : And said he had no idea that she was going to do that and...
UNK: But it's like she's been trying to break us up this whole time.
UNK: It's been her master plan.
Beckett : Now, well, she didn't succeed, darling.
Martha : You and Ashley are stronger than ever.
Martha : And she looks like a fool.
UNK: Yeah. I wish that were true.
UNK: But according to the Internet, Ashley cheated on me.
UNK: She already posted the pictures of them kissing all over her website.
Alexis : It's a nightmare.
