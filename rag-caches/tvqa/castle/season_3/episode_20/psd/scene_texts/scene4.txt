UNK: How did you end up on a date?
UNK: Monica Wyatt : We bumped into each other on the street the other day.
UNK: It was weird, because it was in the Village and I never go down there.
UNK: And he said he doesn't go down there either,
UNK: Monica Wyatt : but he was working on a story.
Beckett : Did he tell you what it was about?
UNK: No.
Castle : How did he seem? Worried? Distressed?
UNK: Monica Wyatt : He seemed like himself.
UNK: Monica Wyatt : Like his old self, like he was onto something.
UNK: He'd just come from the Hall of Records,
UNK: Monica Wyatt : and whatever he found he was really excited about.
