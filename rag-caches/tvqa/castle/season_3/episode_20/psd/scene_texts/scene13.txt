UNK: Well, real or not, he's going away for a long time.
Montomgery : Good work.
UNK: Hey.
Ryan : Narcotics just finished with Monica Wyatt.
Ryan : She cooperated fully.
Beckett : Okay. Process her out.
UNK: And put a patrol car outside her building for the next few nights.
UNK: Just in case Cavallo has friends.
Beckett : What's up?
UNK: I was just thinking about Burns.
Castle : How close he came to catching the guy who killed his daughter,
Castle : only to come up short.
Beckett : Well, if it's any consolation, there's justice now.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: - You know what's still bugging me? - Hmm?
UNK: The guy is running for his life.
UNK: Why does he ditch his phone?
Beckett : Well, he probably knew that he was going to get killed
UNK: and he wanted at least someone to know the truth.
Castle : What truth?

UNK: Monica Wyatt. It says here you moved to New York in 2002 from LA.
Beckett : Yeah, so?
Beckett : So we did a little bit of digging.
Beckett : And the only Monica Wyatt that we found was a heroin addict,
UNK: who was shot point-blank, and then dumped in the LA River.
Castle : Six months later,
UNK: word of a new and brutal kingpin started sweeping the streets.
