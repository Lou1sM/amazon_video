UNK: Monica Wyatt : And you're saying that's me?
UNK: Monica Wyatt : I'm a real estate agent. Have you seen my apartment?
Beckett : Yeah, we saw that one.
Beckett : But all of the other ones can only be previewed online.
UNK: Monica Wyatt : What are you talking about?
Beckett : Your apartment sales. To Walter Neff, Frank Chambers, Richard Harland.
Beckett : They're all characters from noir films.
Beckett : They aren't real.
UNK: You made millions in heroin holdings,
Beckett : which you turned into millions in real estate holdings.
Beckett : All clean.
Castle : All the while perpetuating the myth of Cavallo.
UNK: Monica Wyatt : Gordon didn't die chasing a myth.
Beckett : Oh, yeah, Gordon.
UNK: Well, there's something that you didn't completely lie about.
Beckett : You did meet him a couple of years ago.
UNK: But not as a boyfriend.
UNK: He was a pain-in-the-ass reporter that just kept getting a little too close.
UNK: Until a car came out of nowhere
Castle : and killed his daughter.
Beckett : That got him out of your hair for a couple of years,
Beckett : but then he caught your scent again at Nick's Pizza.
