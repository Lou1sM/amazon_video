Castle : Nice and crispy.
Castle : Just the way you like it.
UNK: You eat it. I'm not hungry.
Castle : You've never said no to turkey bacon. What's wrong?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: Something.
UNK: Don't make me tong you.
UNK: Not even a smile. It must be serious.
Alexis : It's Lauren's birthday party. I'm not going.
Castle : What? You've been talking about that party for weeks.
UNK: It's going to be the party of the century.
Alexis : Yesterday, Lauren came up to me and in front of everybody,
Alexis : told me I was disinvited.
Alexis : It was humiliating.
Castle : Why would Lauren do something like that? She's one of your best friends.
Alexis : She was one of my best friends.
Alexis : I have no idea why she's acting like this. And she refuses to talk to me.
UNK: And Ashley's still invited. And so is everyone else and...
UNK: It's like I'm a social leper.
Castle : Well, Ashley's not going to go without you.
Alexis : Just because I have leprosy doesn't mean he should.
Castle : Well, I think you should throw a rival party.
UNK: And invite all your friends to that one instead.
UNK: The party's tonight. And she has a live band performing.
Alexis : I can't compete with that.
UNK: Well, then I'll call Lauren's mom and I'll...
Alexis : You're joking, right? What, so I can be a leper and a tattletale?
UNK: I'm 17. I can deal with this on my own.
UNK: It's just every instinct in my body is telling me to protect her.
UNK: Yeah, but when it comes to teenagers, not even you can protect her.
