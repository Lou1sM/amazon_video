Beckett : Alexis is going to have to deal with backstabbers her whole life,
Beckett : but she's intelligent enough to rise above all of that.
Beckett : I don't know.
Castle : She looked like she was ready to commit murder.
Beckett : Speaking of murder.
Beckett : I thought Terrific Nick's on the East Side was number one.
UNK: No, that's Authentic Terrific Nick's. This is just Authentic Nick's.
Beckett : - This isn't Terrific? - No. Just Authentic.
Castle : It's also not Terrific Authentic Nick's. But that's across the street.
Beckett : What's the difference?
Lanie : The difference is this one has a dead body in the oven.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : That is really...
Castle : Well done.
UNK: Another couple hours, maybe.
Lanie : But luckily for me he's only half-baked.
UNK: Male, mid-40s. That's about as much ID as I can give you.
Lanie : Based on the oven setting and the body's core temperature,
Lanie : I'd say he went in no sooner than 2 : 00 a.m.
UNK: I'm afraid to ask. Cause of death?
UNK: It wasn't the oven.
UNK: The stab wound through the chest says he was dead when he went in.
UNK: No sign of forced entry,
Esposito : but we're running prints on the door handle just the same.
UNK: All right. Run them on the oven as well. Who found him?
UNK: Uh, Nick Jr.
UNK: Authentic, not Terrific.
UNK: Nick Jr. : No. I got no idea who he is.
UNK: Nick Jr. : I mean, I open up the oven and bam, there he is.
Beckett : Who were the last ones here last night?
UNK: Nick Jr. : My dad and me. We closed around 11 : 00.
UNK: Then I head up to Kaydar Lounge, met up with a lady friend,
UNK: and then we came back here to
UNK: grab a slice.
Beckett : And when was that?
UNK: I dunno. 4 : 30?
Castle : Where's your lady friend now?
UNK: She's kind of throwing up a lot, so the paramedics had to take her in.
UNK: Nick Jr. : Oh, but I kept her number.
UNK: I don't think there's gonna be a second date.
UNK: Nick Jr. : - Yeah, you're right. - I'm sorry.
UNK: I'm gonna need a list of all of your employees and delivery staff.
UNK: Nick Jr. : You don't think it was one of our guys in the oven, do you?
Beckett : As soon as you get me that list, I'll start making phone calls.
UNK: Ralph Carbone : I don't believe this.
UNK: You gotta be kidding me!
UNK: Nick Jr. : Dad, these are the cops.
Castle : You must be Authentic Nick.
UNK: Ralph Carbone : The one and only.
Beckett : Nick? I have the proprietor listed as Ralph Carbone.
UNK: Ralph Carbone : Yeah, that's me. Everybody calls me Nick.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Because that's what everybody calls me.
UNK: I can't believe those bastards put a body in my oven.
Beckett : I'm sorry, Mr. Carbone, you think that you know who did this?
UNK: Ralph Carbone : Yeah, sure.
UNK: I'll bet it was that jackhole.
Castle : Terrific Authentic Nick?
UNK: Nick Jr. : Sal Malavolta. He used to work for us years ago
UNK: before opening his own lousy pizza shop right across the street.
UNK: He stole my frigging recipes. It's Sal that done this.
UNK: Ralph Carbone : - Along with the other two! - The other two?
UNK: Ralph Carbone : Yeah. That vulture there.
Ginger : Terrific Nick?
UNK: Nick Jr. : Vinnie Delfino.
UNK: And that dirtbag there.
Castle : And Authentic Terrific Nick.
UNK: Luca Sabalini. All three of them.
UNK: They're thieves. They live off of our name.
UNK: Ralph Carbone : And they're not even real Nicks. I'm the only real Nick.
Castle : And your real name is Ralph.
UNK: Exactly.
UNK: They've been trying to run me out of Dodge for years.
UNK: And now this. Who's gonna buy my pizza now? Huh?
UNK: Hey! Hey! You happy? I'm out of business.
Beckett : Mr. Carbone, what makes you think that one of them did this?
