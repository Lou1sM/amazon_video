Castle : Maybe it wasn't that easy, look at those throw pillows.
Espostio : What's wrong with them?
Castle : Kim Foster's an interior designer.
Castle : These pillows have been arranged with a barbarian-like gracelessness.
Beckett : Like a man would do it. So she put up a fight.
UNK: They struggled right here on the couch.
Beckett : And then he reset the pillows to cover it up.
Castle : He's out of practice, so he's not so neat.
UNK: What?
UNK: I found a penny.
Castle : Under the circumstances, is this still lucky?
UNK: Wait, I think I found something, too.
UNK: "Vince."
Castle : Think it belonged to the killer?
Beckett : Maybe it's been here for weeks.
UNK: I'm gonna have to get CSU to process this area.
Ryan : Sir, a Mr. Townsend wants a word.
Montgomery : Bring him in.
UNK: Cal!
Montgomery : Good to see you.
Montgomery : How's Marie?
UNK: Cal Townsend : She's okay.
UNK: Cal Townsend : We're split up now.
Montgomery : I'm sorry to hear that.
