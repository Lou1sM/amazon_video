Jerry : do you want to get, huh?
Jerry : Don't say anything you shouldn't.
UNK: Hello.
Martha : your conspiracy theories are completely unfounded.
Castle : My conspiracy theories?
Martha : Alexis's secret admirer is Ashley, her boyfriend!
Castle : Oh, that's great. Thanks.
Castle : I love you.
Montgomery : I don't think there's anything more to say.
Castle : - Castle? - It's clear. He's gone.
Castle : I'm fine. Ryan needs an ambulance.
Ryan : No, I don't.
UNK: Hey. What happened here?
Beckett : I'm so glad that you're okay.
Castle : He's the Triple Killer. He set Gates up to be a copycat.
Beckett : I know. I did the math
Beckett : when you and Ryan didn't come back from talking to Jerry.
Castle : How did you know to come here?
UNK: Your mom called. She said that you told her that you loved her.
Beckett : And she figured something must be terribly wrong.
Castle : I figured she might.
Castle : Good girl.
