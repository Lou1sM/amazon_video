UNK: A valve replacement. It's no big deal. My dad had one.
UNK: Yeah. It is if you don't have money. Who paid for it?
Ryan : I'm guessing Gates did.
Ryan : Maybe he stashed away some money from before prison.
Castle : Yeah. But he was out of prison for a month.
UNK: Why wait till now to do McCardle's operation?
Ryan : He needed McCardle to help him with Linda Russo and Kim Foster.
Jerry : I guess.
Ryan : Packing up?
UNK: Just getting my stuff together.
Castle : All that stuff from prison?
Jerry : You accumulate a lot of stuff, you know, even in the slammer.
Ryan : You were right about Gates.
Ryan : He did try to go after Donna.
Ryan : But she's okay.
Ryan : And Gates?
Ryan : He confessed. It's all over.
Jerry : Thank God.
Castle : Aren't you going to ask what happened?
Castle : To your girlfriend, Donna.
Castle : You didn't ask about her. You just asked about Gates.
UNK: That doesn't make any sense unless...
Castle : She was supposed to die.
Jerry : I don't know what...
Castle : And McCardle didn't get the money for the surgery
Castle : until after you got out of prison.
Castle : He's removing all evidence he was even there.
Castle : It was him all along. He's the real Triple Killer.
Jerry : Guilty as charged.
Montgomery : Excellent work, Detective.
Beckett : Thank you, sir. I hope you say the same to Castle.
Beckett : Where is he, by the way? I thought that they would be back by now.
Montgomery : Maybe he and Ryan went out for a cold one.
Montgomery : After a day like today, that's what I'm doing.
Montgomery : You care to join me?
Beckett : Yeah, I'd love to.
Montgomery : Let's hit it.
Castle : That story about Gates getting arrested.
Castle : That was your story, wasn't it?
UNK: You were afraid you were gonna get caught, so you hid in prison.
UNK: Too bad you didn't figure that out sooner.
