Beckett : We go after the real killer.
UNK: I left work at 7 : 00. I walked home like I always do.
UNK: I got home maybe 7 : 30, and I stayed in all night.
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: This is off of a traffic cam across from Gates' apartment.
Beckett : This is it. This'll prove that he was lying.
UNK: At 7 : 35, he was on his way to Kim Foster's apartment.
UNK: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Stop... Stop there.
UNK: That's him. 7 : 31.
Beckett : No, that can't be.
Esposito : It is. Look.
UNK: Same sideburns.
Esposito : And there's the snake tattoo.
Beckett : Well then, he slipped out the back and went to Kim's.
UNK: How would he get from 101 st to Midtown,
UNK: and change clothes in four minutes?
Beckett : I don't know. But he did it.
Beckett : Can we enhance this video?
Montgomery : You can enhance it all you want.
Montgomery : It doesn't change the facts. We gotta cut him loose.
Beckett : Sir, I just...
Montgomery : I don't like this any more than you, Detective.
Montgomery : But he alibis out.
UNK: Looks like we got it all wrong. You're free to go.
Gates : With this Triple Killer fella running around,
Gates : you all better keep your loved ones close.
UNK: I sure hope you catch him.
Beckett : Put a surveillance detail on him.
UNK: I don't want that son of a bitch out of our sight.
Castle : Oh, don't you look adorable this morning.
Alexis : I meet my secret admirer today.
Caslte : I can just picture the scene.
Caslte : You and your secret admirer agree to meet in the cafeteria.
