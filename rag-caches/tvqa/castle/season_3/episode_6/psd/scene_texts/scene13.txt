Castle : Set to match wits with his interrogators.
UNK: I just wanted to bring in literary flair to the moment, you know?
Beckett : The bartender told us where Gates lives.
Beckett : He's had to put him in a cab on more than one occasion.
Beckett : Ryan's got a warrant and he's searching his place right now.
Montgomery : We can't count on circumstantial evidence to carry this case.
UNK: We need to get this guy to run his mouth.
UNK: The only hard evidence we have on him is Kim Foster's murder.
Montgomery : Pin him down on where he was when she died.
UNK: Castle.
Montgomery : Not this time.
Beckett : Mr. Gates, I'm Detective Beckett.
Gates : Not my type,
UNK: but I would make an exception.
Beckett : Do you know a Kim Foster?
Gates : Doesn't ring a bell.
