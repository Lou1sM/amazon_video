UNK: Too bad you didn't leave sooner. The cops will be here any minute.
Jerry : Looks like Detective Ryan called the precinct just before you got here.
UNK: There won't be anybody missing me for a while.
Jerry : By the time they do, I'll be long gone.
Castle : You won't get far.
UNK: They already have your name, know your face.
UNK: I'll change those. I've done that before.
Jerry : That's part of the fun of it.
Castle : Fun, like setting up Gates?
Jerry : Paul McCardle was the only person in the world that he cared about.
Jerry : Once I learned that, the rest was easy.
Jerry : You never know when you need one of these.
Jerry : Besides, Gates liked prison.
Castle : You taught Gates everything he needed to know to take the fall
Castle : for the Triple Killer murders.
Castle : After that, all you had to do was pay for Paul's surgery
UNK: and you could walk away scot-free. That's a beautiful plan.
UNK: Undone by a duffel bag.
UNK: I'm not undone. I'm right here. I'll relocate. I'll start over.
Jerry : It must eat you alive
UNK: knowing that you came so close to catching me.
UNK: But this is a winner-take-all type of game.
UNK: Oh! Jerry.
UNK: Shooting?
Castle : It's not your style.
Jerry : You really don't know me at all, do you?
Castle : It's not complicated.
Castle : You were raised by a single mother.
UNK: She was blonde. She was beautiful.
