Beckett : She lived in 301.
UNK: Were you ever in that particular unit?
UNK: No.
UNK: Well, then perhaps you can explain to me how we found this nametag
Beckett : with your fingerprint on it lying next to her body.
Gates : As a matter of fact, I can.
UNK: Can't wait to hear this.
Gates : I work at The Empire Prop House.
UNK: And?
Gates : And they rent props for movies and TV shows.
Beckett : I know what a prop house is.
Gates : So that's my job, I stock props.
Gates : Tons of nametags just like this one,
Gates : I bet I've touched a hundred of them.
Montgomery : Run that down, see if he's for real.
Beckett : On it.
Beckett : There's no record of you having this job.
Gates : They pay me under the table.
UNK: Oh!
Gates : Maybe you can get me for tax evasion.
Beckett : This prop house where you say you work,
Beckett : do they have uniforms there?
UNK: Sure.
Beckett : Like gas company uniforms?
Gates : Any kind of uniform you can think of, they got it.
Beckett : And have you ever taken any of these uniforms home?
