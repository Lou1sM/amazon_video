UNK: I got uniforms searching the area. No sign of Gates.
Castle : Maybe he's going after Donna. That way, he could punish Jerry, too.
Montgomery : We got any leads on her whereabouts?
Beckett : Esposito's talking to her friends right now
Beckett : but she's still in the wind.
Ryan : So is Paul McCardle.
UNK: His car's gone and he is, too.
Ryan : Ex-wife has no idea where he is, either.
Ryan : But I did find out how he and Gates are connected.
Ryan : They were in a foster home together.
Beckett : So McCardle could be with Gates.
UNK: Get photos of Gates and McCardle to airport, bus and train stations.
Esposito : just told me she's house sitting at her cousin's.
Beckett : Do you have an address?
Espostio : Yeah, but so does Gates.
Espostio : Some guy dressed as a messenger said he had a delivery for Donna.
Beckett : Get there now.
UNK: NYPD!
Esposito : Get off her.
UNK: I'd like to see you talk your way out of this one.
Gates : I'll try not to disappoint you.
Beckett : We found the same kind of rope in your pocket
Beckett : as was used by the Triple Killer.
Gates : Last I checked, a man's allowed to carry rope.
Beckett : I think you wanted to get caught, Marcus.
