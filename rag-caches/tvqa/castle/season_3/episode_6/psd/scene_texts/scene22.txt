UNK: "I hope you'll be there, too."
Castle : No. No, no, no.
Castle : No, you're not going.
Alexis : Before, you were practically forcing me to find out who he is.
Castle : Not in the park, not by yourself.
Alexis : But I've been there a million times.
UNK: Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Castle : The first note you got,
UNK: "Rope of flaxen hair." Rope! Flaxen! Flaxen is blonde!
Alexis : Dad, I'm a redhead. You are totally overreacting.
Alexis : I'm meeting my secret admirer and that's all there is to it.
Martha : Richard, darling, she's right. You are being utterly irrational.
Martha : and I thought my understudy was trying to poison me.
Castle : Oh, yeah. The daily blood tests I paid for.
Castle : Wait, she did poison you!
Castle : The Swiss chocolate she gave you was a laxative.
Martha : It added a certain urgency to my performance.
Martha : But, the point is, you indulged my paranoia.
Martha : So therefore, I am going to be in the park, 5 : 00,
UNK: at a discreet distance to make sure
UNK: that Alexis's secret admirer is not an ax murderer.
Castle : Thank you.
Martha : You're welcome.
Castle : Tell me you've arrested Gates.
Beckett : I mean, I don't know how, Castle, but he killed Kim Foster.
