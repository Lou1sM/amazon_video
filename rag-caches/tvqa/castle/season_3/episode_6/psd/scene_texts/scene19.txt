UNK: Ryan.
UNK: Tell me you got something.
Ryan : No rope, no uniform.
Ryan : Nothing that ties him to any of the victims.
UNK: The thing is, this nametag is the probable cause for bringing me in.
Gates : But I've explained the fingerprint.
Gates : And by now, I'm sure you've checked out my story.
Beckett : Actually, we're still verifying that.
Gates : I know how this works.
Gates : You do not have probable cause to hold me.
UNK: Is that right? Can't we hold him?
Montgomery : Only in the movies.
Castle : So he can just walk out of here?
UNK: Unless she can catches him in a lie, that gives her cause to keep him.
Gates : I want to leave now.
Beckett : Okay, fine. You can do that.
UNK: But the second that you lawyer up and leave
Beckett : you become the focus of a major investigation.
Beckett : It will disrupt your life in ways you can't even imagine.
Gates : I'm already the focus.
Beckett : Yeah, well, you don't have to be.
Beckett : Look, the truth is,
Beckett : we don't have any evidence that connects you to those murders.
Beckett : It all boils down to Kim Foster.
Beckett : Even if your fingerprints got on this nametag by accident,
Beckett : with your record, you still look like a suspect to us.
Beckett : So Kim Foster's a problem for you.
Beckett : You said you've never been to her apartment.
UNK: Where you were at 7 : 35 last night?
Gates : What's in that for me?
Beckett : If your alibi checks out, then we move on.
