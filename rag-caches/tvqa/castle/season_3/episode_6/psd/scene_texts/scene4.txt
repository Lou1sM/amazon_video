Mccardle : I was bowling with some buddies at Galaxy Lanes.
Castle : So why did you decide to abandon your career as a horticultural technician?
Mccardle : I just wanted to move on.
Beckett : Because you used that job to watch Linda, to stalk her,
Beckett : and once she was dead, why stick around?
Mccardle : That is not true. I'm innocent, here.
Beckett : Well, you don't look innocent.
Castle : As a matter of fact,
Castle : you give new meaning to the phrase sweating a suspect.
Mccardle : Okay, yeah, I perspire a lot, okay?
Mccardle : I have a medical condition.
Beckett : Well, that's the least of your problems, Mr. McCardle.
Beckett : Your fixation with Linda Russo was well-known,
Beckett : as was your history of violence against women.
Beckett : Your car was seen outside of her apartment
Beckett : and now she's dead.
Mccardle : I never touched her!
Mccardle : I had a thing for Linda, okay?
Mccardle : I had a thing for Linda and I parked out in front of her place,
Mccardle : but I haven't been anywhere near there in three days, okay?
Mccardle : Not since that guy threatened me.
Beckett : What guy?
Mccardle : I got rousted by some security guy
Mccardle : and he told me to move on.
Mccardle : And it really freaked me out and I haven't been back there since.
Mccardle : I swear that's the truth.
UNK: So Sweaty-Von-Sweats-A-Lot, his alibi's holding.
UNK: The manager at Galaxy Lanes
UNK: Javier Esposito : has him throwing gutter balls from 5 : 00 until close.
Beckett : What about the security guard?
Esposito : Ryan checked into that.
UNK: Turns out, that there's only one building on Linda's block that uses guards.
Esposito : According to the security company, no incident report was ever filed
Esposito : against McCardle or his vehicle.
Castle : So McCardle was lying.
Beckett : Maybe not.
Beckett : You know, in the past, the Triple Killer posed as a security guard.
Beckett : Maybe our guard wasn't a guard after all.
