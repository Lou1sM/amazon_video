UNK: and we're doing all we can to chase them down.
Montgomery : If we make an arrest, you'll be the first to know.
Montgomery : I promise you.
UNK: Sara would've been 29 next week.
Townsend : Don't let him do this to another family.
UNK: Hey!
Beckett : Hey, there's no news from CSU on the nametag,
Beckett : not that I was expecting any.
Castle : Makes you wonder why he didn't pull
Castle : that whole gas leak routine on Linda Russo.
Beckett : I know why. The answer's in here.
Castle : A transcript?
Beckett : From four years ago.
Beckett : I took a look at calls made to the Triple Killer tip line
Beckett : and this one stood out for me.
UNK: It's from May 21 st, 2006.
Beckett : Which was a week after the sixth murder.
Beckett : A woman called and left a message,
Beckett : but she was too afraid to leave her name.
Beckett : But she did mention that she lived at 24th and 10th.
UNK: The same corner as Linda Russo.
Beckett : She was riding an elevator with a cable repairman,
Beckett : who so creeped her out that she got off a floor early
Beckett : just to get away from him.
Castle : Yeah, but cable guy and creepy, that's a job requirement.
Beckett : Except he wasn't a cable guy.
Beckett : She said he wasn't carrying the right tools.
Castle : And working for a cable company, Linda Russo would know that.
Beckett : Which is why I took a look at Linda Russo's phone records
Beckett : from four years ago.
UNK: She's the one who made the call to that tip line.
Castle : So Linda Russo was special.
Beckett : When she got off a floor early, he knew that she made him,
Beckett : so he dropped out of sight.
Castle : Which also explains why he attacked her outside.
