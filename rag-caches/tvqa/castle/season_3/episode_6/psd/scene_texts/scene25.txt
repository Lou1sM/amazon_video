Jerry : There was this one time he told me about this chick, Sara,
Jerry : down in SoHo.
UNK: That could be Sara Townsend.
Jerry : He told me about how he busted into her place
Jerry : and things got out of control.
UNK: But it must've been pretty bad
UNK: because Gates said he was worried that the cops were after him.
UNK: So he busted a bottle over this guy's head to get himself locked up.
Jerry : That way he'd be under the radar for a while.
UNK: That's a good start.
UNK: My name is Detective Ryan, I'm your new best friend.
UNK: The hotel's under surveillance.
Ryan : For your own safety, you cannot leave or use the phone.
Ryan : Right now, you and I need to go over everything Gates ever said to you,
Ryan : even if it seems stupid or unimportant.
Montgomery : Jerry's story squares with the facts.
UNK: Sara Townsend was Gates' sixth victim and she lives in SoHo.
UNK: Alexis Castle : What about assault-with-a-deadly-bottle?
Montgomery : It fits, too. It came a week after Sara's death.
Montgomery : Looks like Gates sent himself up the river on purpose.
UNK: That's still not enough to arrest him, is it?
UNK: No, but if Jerry has more tidbits like that, it may help us get there.
Esposito : We can't locate Donna Gallagher, and she's not picking up her cell.
Beckett : Sir, where is Gates now?
Montgomery : At his apartment. Surveillance says he hasn't left the building.
Beckett : Contact Donna's friends and family, find out where she is.
Beckett : I told Jerry we'd keep her safe.
UNK: Right.
Jerry : Can't you just arrest this guy? I mean, you know he did these things.
Ryan : He has an alibi. We can't put him at the murder scene.
Jerry : He used partners sometimes. You know that, right?
UNK: Partner?
Ryan : We never ran across anything about a partner.
Jerry : Oh, yeah. He said a partner helps him get away with things.
Jerry : Though I get the idea he never uses the same partner twice.
UNK: Jerry said that Gates used a partner.
