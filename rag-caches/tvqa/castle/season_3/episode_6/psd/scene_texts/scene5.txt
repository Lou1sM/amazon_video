Beckett : Maybe he was the Triple Killer, moving McCardle off of his turf.
Montgomery : Well, whoever he is, he's sticking to his schedule.
Montgomery : We have a second victim.
Lanie : Her name's Kim Foster, 28, an interior designer.
Lanie : Same rope marks on her neck.
Lanie : Same everything.
Beckett : When did she die?
Lanie : Based on liver temp, I'd say sometime last night.
Lanie : Probably early evening.
UNK: A neighbor saw a gas repairman leave at 7 : 45.
Castle : No doorman on the building,
UNK: so the Triple Killer calls Kim Foster on the intercom,
Castle : says he wants to check a gas leak.
Castle : She buzzes him in.
Espostio : Let me check the incoming caller IDs.
Beckett : I don't get it. Why did he return to the old MO?
UNK: Nostalgia.
Beckett : He killed Linda Russo in an alley.
Beckett : She didn't have a doorman either,
Beckett : why didn't he just kill her in her apartment like all the others?
Castle : Maybe she was special somehow.
