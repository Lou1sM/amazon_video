Castle : I got nothing.
Beckett : I just need some piece of evidence.
Beckett : I mean, someone that he talked to. Anything.
Castle : What if Gates confided in Jerry about the previous murders?
UNK: Yeah, well, Jerry's not gonna talk to us.
Beckett : He got beaten up in the prison yard this morning.
Beckett : And he thinks that Gates had something to do with it.
Castle : Sounds like Gates is afraid of what Jerry Tyson knows.
Jerry : Get the hell away from me.
Beckett : Listen, Jerry. We just need a little more information on Marcus Gates.
Jerry : Don't you guys get it?
Jerry : I'm a dead man, thanks to you!
Beckett : Not if we get you out.
Beckett : The DA has agreed to get you an early release and police protection.
Jerry : Gates knows about my girlfriend.
Jerry : Donna Gallagher. He could get to her, too.
Beckett : Well, then, we'll make sure he doesn't.
UNK: We got to move on this, Jerry.
Beckett : Last chance.
Jerry : Okay. I'll do it. I'll take the deal.
Castle : We need to know.
Castle : Did Gates ever talk to you about attacking women?
