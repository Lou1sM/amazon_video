Alexis : Nice try.
UNK: This guy's never gonna give it up.
Beckett : Sir, I need leverage and I don't have any.
Beckett : There's no witnesses,
Beckett : there's no proof that connects him to any of the murders.
Beckett : The only thing that I've got him on is an assault charge.
UNK: Hey.
Ryan : We just got a hit on McCardle's APB. He's at St. Benjamin's Hospital.
Castle : Maybe Gates got to him.
Beckett : Sir, if I can get McCardle to roll...
Castle : - Go. - Yeah.
UNK: I... Yeah...
UNK: Okay, fine, Castle. Go.
Beckett : Just stay out of his way.
Beckett : And, Ryan, get me something I can break him with.
Ryan : Excuse me. I'm Detective Ryan.
Ryan : We'd like a word with Mr. McCardle.
Doctor : You can't have one. He just got out of heart surgery.
Beckett : What for?
Doctor : Congenital valve defect.
Castle : Would that cause excessive sweating, by any chance?
Doctor : Among other more serious symptoms.
UNK: He's been in dire need of surgery for over a year.
Castle : So why get it now?
Doctor : He finally came up with the money.
Doctor : It's kind of a costly procedure.
Ryan : How costly?
UNK: About $ 100,000.
Ryan : Who footed the bill?
Doctor : That's confidential information.
Castle : You spoke to his ex-wife. She didn't even know he was here.
Ryan : She hated the guy.
Ryan : So who sent the flowers?
Castle : McCardle's surgery had nothing to do with Gates.
UNK: In fact, Gates sent him get-well flowers.
Beckett : Which means he cares about his foster brother.
Castle : That's your leverage.
UNK: No.
Beckett : Tell Jerry his girlfriend's fine
Beckett : and he doesn't have to worry about Gates anymore.
Gates : You keep coming back for more.
