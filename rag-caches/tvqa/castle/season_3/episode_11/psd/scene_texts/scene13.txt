UNK: You have the photographs? From where?
UNK: Her divorce file. Pretty salacious, too.
UNK: Can I see, for a minute?
UNK: Castle, we're looking into a murder, not dirty photos.
UNK: Or maybe we can do both! Look familiar?
UNK: That's Chloe, Duke Jones's assistant.
UNK: The 250 grand?
UNK: That was a payment to Stacey to break up Tonya's pre-nup.
UNK: So Stacey hired Duke in order to get photographic evidence.
UNK: Mmm-hmm. Duke's assistant Chloe, here, was the bait.
UNK: And then they honeytrapped Bill Wellington to break up the pre-nup,
UNK: costing him $ 100 million.
UNK: Man, if I were him, I'd be out for blood.
UNK: Let's bring him in.
UNK: You have copies of that file?
UNK: Oh, I copy everything.
UNK: That guy looks like a pit bull.
UNK: I could see him sticking someone through a wrought-iron fence.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Stacey must've felt incredibly guilty putting Tonya in a relationship with him.
UNK: So she decided to level the playing field.
