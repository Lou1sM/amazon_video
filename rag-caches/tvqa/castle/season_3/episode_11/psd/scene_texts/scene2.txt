UNK: It's Beckett. She is gonna hate the idea of Natalie Rhodes.
UNK: Pick it up, Dad. A murder will make you feel better.
UNK: What up, boys?
UNK: Excuse me. Hey, Castle. How's it going?
UNK: Good. What's up?
UNK: Ryan.
UNK: I don't know what to say. I mean, I'm flattered, but...
UNK: Oh, come on. It's nice, right? Right?
UNK: Jenny is a lucky girl. So, how you gonna pop the question?
UNK: Hot air balloon? Skywriter? JumboTron!
UNK: I thought I'd just ask.
UNK: No, no, no.
UNK: You can't just ask.
UNK: You gotta make a statement. It's gotta be big. Helicopter ride.
UNK: Actually, most girls prefer something a little more intimate.
UNK: What, so, he's just supposed to be boring and ask,
UNK: "Will you marry me?"
UNK: And helicopter rides are intimate.
UNK: Yeah, sure.
UNK: If you wanna share the most romantic moment of your life
UNK: with Reggie the chopper pilot.
UNK: Helicopter ride.
UNK: Our victim is Stacey Collins. She's 45.
UNK: According to her business card, she's a high-end matchmaker.
UNK: Without the reality show.
UNK: Or pulse.
UNK: That, too.
UNK: Defensive wounds indicate that she was attacked.
UNK: We found her purse with wallet, credit card and cash inside.
UNK: But the thing that was missing were her keys.
UNK: Uniforms are on their way to her apartment and office
UNK: to see if our killer decided to use them.
UNK: Yo! So apparently our victim was at a surprise party
UNK: thrown in her honor last night
UNK: by all the happy couples that she'd matched up.
UNK: Where was the party?
UNK: Oscar's Grill. 85th and 3rd.
UNK: That's only seven blocks from here.
UNK: Collins left the party just before 10 : 00.
UNK: M.E. estimates the time of death between 10 : 00 and 11 : 00.
UNK: Killer could've been at the party and followed her.
UNK: Gosh! You think a married person killed the woman
Ryan : who gave them such happiness, do you?
Ryan : Yeah, I'll start on bringing them in.
UNK: Surprise visit from the Mayor?
UNK: Better.
UNK: Holy smoke! That's Natalie Rhodes!
UNK: Sure is. Apparently, she is playing Nikki Heat.
UNK: What? That's awesome.
UNK: Yeah, it's awesome. What is she doing here?
UNK: She called and asked if she could shadow me for a little while.
UNK: She wanted to get an authentic feel for what it's like to be Nikki
UNK: by following the person who inspired Nikki.
UNK: - And you said yes? - Yeah.
UNK: Detective Beckett?
UNK: My God! You are exactly what I imagined Nikki Heat would look like.
UNK: Natalie, this is Richard Castle and this is Detective Javier Esposito.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Just so you know, Detective,
UNK: I'm very method,
UNK: so it's all about getting inside of you,
UNK: which starts with observing and noting.
UNK: Okay, well, observe and note away. I'm already used to it.
UNK: I'm sorry, I don't think you heard. I'm Richard Castle.
UNK: Great.
UNK: Oh, I thought your name sounded familiar.
UNK: Hey, I just got off the phone with the guys at the...
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Natalie, this is Detective Kevin Ryan.
UNK: Uh...
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Ryan! The call?
UNK: Yeah, looks like our killer took our victim's keys for a reason.
UNK: Uniforms just got to her office. Place has been tossed.
