UNK: Sweetie, could we just talk about this?
UNK: - Jenny, please... - No, I hate you, Kevin Ryan!
UNK: Ooh! That was dramatic.
UNK: What happened?
UNK: I accidentally left my phone at home, and she brought it to me.
UNK: And while she was here, she asked Javier how darts was last night.
UNK: Oh! Your cover story for going to see her parents.
UNK: You should've told me, bro.
