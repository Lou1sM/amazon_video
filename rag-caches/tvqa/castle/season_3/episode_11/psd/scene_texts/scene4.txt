UNK: And she's a civilian.
UNK: I mean, aren't you afraid she's going to get in the way
UNK: and mess up the case?
UNK: You're kidding, right?
UNK: Hey, Natalie. Want to join in on your first interview?
UNK: Yep, be right there.
UNK: Our killer was definitely after something.
UNK: "Pleased to meet you, Ms. Rhodes." How hard is that to say?
UNK: Now she thinks I'm an idiot.
UNK: Yeah, probably.
UNK: Great. And she's on my list. My Freebie Five.
UNK: You know, celebrities you're allowed to make an exception with
UNK: if you ever got the chance. Jenny even knows.
UNK: I wouldn't worry about it, bro.
UNK: Oh, my God! What happened?
UNK: And you are?
UNK: Julie Taylor. I work here. For Stacey Collins.
UNK: I'm afraid we have some bad news for you, Ms. Taylor.
UNK: Well, I hope we were helpful.
UNK: Wow!
UNK: Are all the folks you interview always that unhelpful?
UNK: It's a numbers game.
UNK: You talk to enough people, something usually shakes out.
UNK: That is going in the movie.
UNK: Yeah, being a cop, it's kind of like being a prospector.
UNK: Gotta sift through a lot a rock before you finally hit gold.
UNK: No. Her line was better. "Usually shakes out."
UNK: Besides client files, was there anything of value here?
UNK: Did she keep cash on hand?
UNK: No. I mean, especially not lately. Business is way down.
UNK: Did you guys take a hit from the economy?
UNK: Mostly it was Stacey. She kept turning down clients.
UNK: Why would she do that?
UNK: All I know is, two months ago she started rejecting applications.
