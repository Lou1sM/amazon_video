UNK: What did you get?
UNK: Just a little something to help with my research.
UNK: Where's the ladies room?
UNK: Yeah, just by the elevator.
UNK: Great. Thanks.
UNK: Yeah. I know her. That's Greta.
UNK: - Greta? - Greta Morgan.
UNK: She stayed here about three weekends ago, is that right?
UNK: Yes, and checked out last Monday.
UNK: Two week stay, huh?
UNK: Did you notice anybody with her? This guy, perhaps?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, he met her in the lobby a couple of times.
UNK: She must really be in big trouble, huh?
UNK: Why's that?
UNK: There was a cop here the other day asking all the same questions.
UNK: Duke's assistant, Chloe? Greta Morgan.

UNK: Maybe. APBs are out on Greta, and I contacted other precincts
