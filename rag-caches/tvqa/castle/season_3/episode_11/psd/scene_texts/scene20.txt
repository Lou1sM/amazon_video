UNK: She thought you lied to her.
UNK: Yeah. And then she found out I was working with you,
UNK: which I hadn't told her.
UNK: What's the big deal about that?
UNK: You're on my list.
UNK: What list?
UNK: My list. My Freebie Five.
UNK: The five celebrities you can sleep with if you had the chance to...
UNK: And now she thinks that last night that we...
UNK: And I should probably stop talking right now.
UNK: I should call her is what I should do. Excuse me.
UNK: Freebie Five, huh? I wonder what number I am.
UNK: Why does that not surprise me?
UNK: So any update on our honeytrapper?
UNK: Yeah. I heard from all of the other precincts.
UNK: And none of the other cops were looking for a Chloe GraveslGreta Morgan
UNK: at the Beaumont.
UNK: Someone was. What about Duke? Any sign of him?
UNK: Well, we are looking into his credit cards and his phone,
UNK: but so far, no hits.
UNK: Maybe not on Duke's cards, but I just found something on Greta's.
UNK: She put holds on rooms at two other pricey hotels within the last week.
UNK: The charges were reversed
UNK: and the rooms were ultimately paid for on another credit card.
UNK: A corporate card belonging to a Stacey Collins, our victim.
UNK: The last week?
UNK: That was long after they'd gotten the evidence
UNK: they needed on Bill Wellington.
UNK: They were honeytrapping other men.
UNK: So one of the other men finds out he's being set up.
UNK: He follows Greta from the Beaumont Hotel back to Stacey.
UNK: He confronts her, they get into an argument, in a rage he kills her.
UNK: Taking her keys
UNK: to get rid of any incriminating evidence of the affair at her office.
UNK: Check the other hotels. Let's see what we can find on Greta.
