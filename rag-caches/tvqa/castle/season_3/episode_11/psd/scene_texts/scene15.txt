UNK: Stacey Collins engineered the whole thing in order to break your pre-nup.
UNK: That bitch did what?
UNK: Mr. Wellington...
UNK: Are you telling me that this piece of tail worked for Stacey?
UNK: And that Stacey and my wife arranged all this?
UNK: Cost you 100 million bucks. I've seen people kill for far less.
UNK: Now you listen to me, Detective.
UNK: I had nothing to do with that murder. Because had I known?
UNK: I would've killed Stacey and Tonya! Both!
UNK: Where were you last Sunday night, Mr. Wellington?
UNK: Hong Kong?
UNK: He was there for a week.
UNK: His jet touched down at Westchester County Airport yesterday afternoon.
UNK: Maybe he hired someone. We should re-check his financials.
UNK: Beckett. Just got back from Duke's.
UNK: The entire place is cleaned out.
UNK: There's no files, no computers, not even a paper clip.
UNK: Checked his home address, too. No sign of him. He's gone.
UNK: What about our honeytrap Chloe?
UNK: No Chloe Graves matching her description in the Tri-State area.
UNK: And Stacey's assistant, Julie, never heard of her or Duke or honeytrapping.
UNK: With her and Duke gone, there's no way to track 'em down.
UNK: So either Stacey's murderer has spooked them both
UNK: and they got out of Dodge or...
UNK: Or they killed Stacey and now they're on the run.
