UNK: Ms. Taylor, does anyone in Stacey's life drive a silver Boxster?
UNK: Yeah. Brad does.
UNK: I was in love with Stacey.
UNK: What makes you think I could possibly kill her?
UNK: If you were so in love with her,
UNK: why did you have a screaming match in her office yesterday?
UNK: We argue. I'm a passionate person.
UNK: Obviously.
UNK: And then after she dumped you,
UNK: you couldn't handle the rejection and so you killed her.
UNK: That's not true.
UNK: When you and Stacey fought, you said you wanted something back.
UNK: - What was it? - My dignity.
UNK: You trashed her office looking for your dignity?
UNK: I didn't kill her and I didn't trash her office.
UNK: Stacey stepped out on me. That's why we broke up.
UNK: And that gives you even greater reason to have killed her.
UNK: She's amazing!
UNK: Look at her eye contact.
UNK: The way she won't let go.
UNK: I love that.
UNK: Are you kidding? I love it.
UNK: Spike Rosenberg is one of my favorite screenwriters.
UNK: Yeah. Not the script.
