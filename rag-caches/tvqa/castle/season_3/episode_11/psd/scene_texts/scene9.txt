UNK: Can you explain where that came from?
UNK: I'm afraid Ms. Wellington chooses not to answer that question.
UNK: Did you give Stacey that cash?
UNK: What was it for?
UNK: Ms. Wellington, who else knew that she had it?

UNK: And I will remind your client that this is a murder investigation
UNK: and I believe that that bag and money are at the heart of this case.
UNK: Tread lightly, Detective. My client's here as a courtesy.
UNK: And her husband, Bill Wellington, is a powerful man.
UNK: Ms. Wellington, what happened two months ago?
