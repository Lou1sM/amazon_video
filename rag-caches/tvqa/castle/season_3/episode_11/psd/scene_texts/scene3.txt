UNK: You guys go to the office, see what the killer was after.
UNK: We'll go interview party guests,
UNK: and see if we can shed some light on what this was all about.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Come on.
UNK: Hello, I'm your creator.
UNK: Who would want to kill a matchmaker?
Beckett : Well, that's what we have to find out.
Beckett : And the first 48 hours are the most critical.
Beckett : After that, evidence gets corrupted, witnesses get less reliable.
UNK: And, oh...

Beckett : I already talked to them, but it's just...
UNK: It's not every day we get someone famous in here.
Beckett : Listen up, everybody. This is Natalie Rhodes.
Beckett : She will be shadowing me for a little while,
UNK: so if you want to gawk, just get it over with
Beckett : so we can all get back to work.
UNK: And if anyone wants a picture and autograph, just come on over.
UNK: I can't believe you said it was okay for her to tail us
UNK: without asking me first.
UNK: Not us, Castle. Me.
UNK: Oh, my God. You like her, don't you?
UNK: Yeah. So?
UNK: Well, the way that she beheaded those zombies
UNK: with the samurai sword was pretty cool.
UNK: Yes, it was cool.
UNK: But that does not make her Nikki Heat.
UNK: Nikki Heat is classy, she's complicated.
UNK: She's a thinking man's cop.
UNK: No, we can't judge a book by its cover.
UNK: Yes, actually. Yes, I can, when it's my book.
