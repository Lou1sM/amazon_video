UNK: Oh, yeah.
UNK: You know, the script is so much about the passion between Nikki and Rook.
UNK: And if I'm going to play Nikki right,
UNK: I gotta feel that heat.
UNK: Natalie, I'm...
UNK: Not Natalie.
UNK: Nikki.
UNK: Good morning, Castle.
UNK: Good morning, Detective.
UNK: Is that for me or for the fictional version of me?
UNK: Or have you already taken care of her this morning?
UNK: What is... What is that supposed to mean?
Castle : - I... Jenny!
UNK: Jenny. Wait! Could...
UNK: Excuse me. Jenny! Could you please...
UNK: Sweetie, could we just talk about this?
UNK: - Jenny, please... - No, I hate you, Kevin Ryan!
UNK: Ooh! That was dramatic.
UNK: What happened?
UNK: I accidentally left my phone at home, and she brought it to me.
UNK: And while she was here, she asked Javier how darts was last night.
UNK: Oh! Your cover story for going to see her parents.
UNK: You should've told me, bro.
UNK: She thought you lied to her.
UNK: Yeah. And then she found out I was working with you,
UNK: which I hadn't told her.
UNK: What's the big deal about that?
UNK: You're on my list.
UNK: What list?
UNK: My list. My Freebie Five.
UNK: The five celebrities you can sleep with if you had the chance to...
UNK: And now she thinks that last night that we...
UNK: And I should probably stop talking right now.
UNK: I should call her is what I should do. Excuse me.
UNK: Freebie Five, huh? I wonder what number I am.
UNK: Why does that not surprise me?
UNK: So any update on our honeytrapper?
UNK: Yeah. I heard from all of the other precincts.
UNK: And none of the other cops were looking for a Chloe GraveslGreta Morgan
UNK: at the Beaumont.
UNK: Someone was. What about Duke? Any sign of him?
UNK: Well, we are looking into his credit cards and his phone,
UNK: but so far, no hits.
UNK: Maybe not on Duke's cards, but I just found something on Greta's.
UNK: She put holds on rooms at two other pricey hotels within the last week.
UNK: The charges were reversed
UNK: and the rooms were ultimately paid for on another credit card.
UNK: A corporate card belonging to a Stacey Collins, our victim.
UNK: The last week?
UNK: That was long after they'd gotten the evidence
UNK: they needed on Bill Wellington.
UNK: They were honeytrapping other men.
UNK: So one of the other men finds out he's being set up.
UNK: He follows Greta from the Beaumont Hotel back to Stacey.
UNK: He confronts her, they get into an argument, in a rage he kills her.
UNK: Taking her keys
UNK: to get rid of any incriminating evidence of the affair at her office.
UNK: Check the other hotels. Let's see what we can find on Greta.
Esposito : - Right. Thanks.
UNK: I'm gonna check on Ryan.
UNK: Great.
UNK: Can I ask you a question?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Is Castle gay?
UNK: I'm sorry, what? No. No.
UNK: Then you two are an item, but you're sworn to secrecy, right?
UNK: No, we are not an item. Why?
UNK: Last night, I invited him back to my place,
UNK: and he said something to me I have never heard from a man before.
UNK: What?
UNK: "No."
UNK: No?
UNK: I don't get it.
UNK: He's into you, but you're determined not to give in to these feelings
UNK: that you clearly have for him.
UNK: So he fantasizes about you through his writing.
UNK: It's literally verbal masturbation.
UNK: Yeah... Okay. So what does this all have to do with me?
UNK: I am not wearing this get-up for my health.
UNK: You're Nikki Heat. He's Jameson Rook.
UNK: I need to sleep with him in the name of character research.
