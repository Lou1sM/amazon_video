Castle : The character of Nikki Heat is a smart, complicated detective
UNK: with enormous depth.
Castle : And then, the studio goes and casts the braless co-ed
Martha : Thanks in no small part to Natalie Rhodes.
Martha : And your books are not exactly Shakespeare.
UNK: Thank you. I was just hoping to elevate their stature
UNK: Hey, I liked that movie.
UNK: If I had seen it, which I haven't.
UNK: Look, this is an audition tape. Give the girl a chance.
UNK: she actually lived in her house's crawlspace
UNK: for a week to prepare for the role.
UNK: Well, you gotta admit, that's dedication to the craft.
UNK: How about that dialogue?
UNK: I mean, how hacky is that?
UNK: All right, "Right now you need to think about the people who love you."
UNK: Like that's gonna stop a murderer?
UNK: That screenwriter needs to spend a week in a crawlspace.
UNK: Okay, darling, enough with the complaining.
UNK: It's Beckett. She is gonna hate the idea of Natalie Rhodes.
