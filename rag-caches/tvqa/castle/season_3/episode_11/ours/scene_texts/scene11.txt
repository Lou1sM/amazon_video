UNK: She refused and then you killed her.
UNK: No! No! No.
UNK: - Mr. Donner, you're under arrest for... - No!
UNK: - Gun! - Hey!
UNK: You stay back, all of you!
UNK: You do not need to do this, Scott. Give me the gun.
UNK: No! I didn't mean to kill her!
UNK: I just wanted the pictures!
UNK: She tried to break away.
UNK: I didn't even see the gate there. And those spikes...
UNK: Okay, fine. It was an accident.
UNK: What does it matter? It's all over for me.
UNK: Scott, give me the gun and I promise you, you will get a fair trial!
UNK: You think I'm fooling around here, Detective?
UNK: No, I don't.
UNK: I think you feel trapped and you're serious as hell.
UNK: But right now, you need to think about the people who love you.
UNK: And they need you to put down that gun.
UNK: Guess that script wasn't so hacky after all.
UNK: You know, it's tragic, really.
UNK: All Stacey wanted was to help save these women
UNK: from getting screwed in their divorces.
UNK: Instead she winds up getting killed.
UNK: Well, thanks to you, we only have one death on our hands.
UNK: I'm just glad it all worked out.
UNK: But I could have used another take.
UNK: I should have added a beat in that last line.
UNK: Instead of, "Put down that gun,"
UNK: I should have said, "Put down
UNK: "that gun." Hear the difference? Totally adds layers.
UNK: Sounded good to me. Sounded just like me.
UNK: Thanks for everything, Kate. I'll try to do you and Nikki justice.
UNK: Even if I didn't get to do all the character research I'd hoped.
UNK: Visit me on set, Castle?
UNK: I wouldn't miss it.
UNK: I wouldn't.
Martha : Natalie Rhodes.
UNK: And I thought it was cool working with you, Castle.
UNK: Nice.
UNK: - Hi, guys. - Hey.
UNK: - Jenny! - Hey.
UNK: Jenny. I am so glad to see you.
UNK: I just wanted to tell you all, I'm sorry about before.
UNK: I made a scene and...
UNK: Jenny, it's okay.
UNK: No. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, Kevin.
UNK: And I want you to know that I trust you, and I love you. I'm sorry.
UNK: No, I...
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: No, I'm the one who's sorry because I lied to you.
UNK: But I'm gonna set the record straight, right now,
UNK: because you deserve the truth.
UNK: So wait here just one second?
UNK: What is he doing?
UNK: Shh!
UNK: I didn't play darts with Javier last night.
UNK: I went to go see your parents because I had a question for them.
UNK: Jennifer Scout Duffy-O'Malley,
UNK: will you make me the happiest guy in the world and marry me?
UNK: Oh, my God. Yes. Yes! Yes!
UNK: Yes?
UNK: Oh, my God.
UNK: That was big.
UNK: And intimate.
