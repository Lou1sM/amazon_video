Beckett : Tell that to the victim.
UNK: Oh, hey. Captain Beckett. What brings you out into the field?
Beckett : Work. what do you think,
Beckett : I'm going to be stuck in the office just 'cause I'm Captain?
Beckett : So who's our fugitive?
Esposito : No ID yet, but the jumpsuit is standard issue at Rikers.
UNK: But they say that none of their prisoners have gone missing.
Ryan : We had them lock down the facility,
UNK: but a 14,000-inmate headcount's gonna take some time.
Beckett : - You run his prints? - Yeah. So far, nothing.
Beckett : Nothing? The guy's a convicted felon. His fingerprints are on file.
Ryan : - Yeah. - Probably a glitch.
Esposito : You know, those portable scanners,
Esposito : - sometimes they're wonky. - Yeah.
Beckett : Is there any chance that this wasn't a homicide?
UNK: Lanie Parish : None. It took brute force to puncture the victim's body with that branch.
UNK: Someone had to shove him onto it.
Beckett : So how does an escaped convict from Rikers Island
Beckett : end up in the middle of Central Park without anyone seeing him?
Lanie : It was late.
Lanie : Lividity puts the time of death between midnight and 2 : 00 a.m.
