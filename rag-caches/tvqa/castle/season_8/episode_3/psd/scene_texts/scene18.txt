Smith : Come on, boy.
UNK: Oh, you're getting too old for drinking games, kiddo.
Castle : It was for the case.
Martha : The one that Katherine keeps throwing you off of?
Castle : I didn't win her love overnight the first time.
UNK: I'm making progress, huh?
UNK: Hey.
Castle : Where are we on Peter's faculty girlfriend?
Alexis : Dr. Barbara Lillstrom. Head of the psych department at Hudson U.
Alexis : Top of her class at Harvard Med School.
Alexis : She was advising Peter's senior thesis.
Castle : And they had an illicit student-faculty relationship.
Castle : One that ended ugly once he rejected her.
Castle : Only I'm betting Peter was expecting a bad grade, not impalement.
Alexis : I contacted the psych department. Lillstrom's been out all week.
Castle : She could be on the run.
Alexis : If she is, she didn't run far. Or at least her phone didn't.
Alexis : Her cell signal went dead yesterday,
Alexis : but it last pinged off a tower outside of a tenant-Iess building here.
Castle : That's four blocks away from where Peter was killed.
Esposito : You know,
UNK: ifyou wanna curry favor with Katherine after last night's little debacle,
Martha : you might tell her about this.
Castle : No, first, we'll confirm Lillstrom is there,
Castle : then we'll call in the cavalry.
