UNK: Kevin Ryan : - Beckett. - It's Vikram.
Vikram : I found your dead guy resurrected in New Jersey
Vikram : and I know where you can find him.
Beckett : It's been a long time.
UNK: Mr. Smith : What the hell are you doing here?
Beckett : Sorry to shake your snow globe, but you helped me once,

Beckett : and I need your help again.
UNK: Forget it. I've paid all my debts.
Beckett : This man killed an Assistant AG
Beckett : connected to Bracken's dirty money scheme.
Smith : I don't know him.
Beckett : He works for Bracken's partner.
Beckett : Some mystery man or woman deep inside the CIA.
Smith : Why can't you just leave this alone?
Beckett : I wasn't built that way.
Smith : Look, I've got a good thing here.
Smith : A woman who loves me. A new life.
Smith : I'm happy.
Smith : You could be, too.
Smith : You just have to let it go.
Castle : I can't.
Smith : What makes you think the drug shipments stopped
Smith : with Vulcan Simmons' death?
Smith : Every narcotic has a signature, a fingerprint, ifyou will.
UNK: You find his, pick up the trail.
Castle : - Thank you. - Don't.
UNK: You're gonna get yourself killed.
