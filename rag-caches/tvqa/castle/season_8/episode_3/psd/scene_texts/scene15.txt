Vikram : that you need me to uncover?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Good, 'cause I'm not a huge fan of shoveling.
Alexis : What are the odds Peter really wanted this apartment for studying?
Ryan : I'd say those odds are less than zero.
UNK: NYPD.
Esposito : I thought Peter was majoring in marketing, not medieval torture.
Alexis : This stuff isn't for torture, it's a BDSM dungeon.
UNK: What? I read Fifty Shades, and, clearly, so had Peter.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : I'm thinking this is a little less Fifty Shades,
UNK: a little more Fatal Attraction.
Castle : So, Peter and his bondage-curious lover
Castle : set up shop here to fulfill all their fantasies.
UNK: Mmm. Role-play. Perhaps "kinky convict and the wicked warden."
UNK: Uh...
Castle : Anyway, Peter tries to break it off.
Castle : The lover, spurned, flies into a murderous rage
Castle : and then impales him in the park.
UNK: AII right, we need to figure out who Peter's been entertaining here.
Ryan : That means we need to start knocking on some doors,
Ryan : pulling surveillance footage...
Alexis : There's an easier way.
Alexis : Frat boys love to kiss and tell.
Alexis : If anyone knows who Peter was involved with, it'll be his brothers.
Esposito : Yeah, but they weren't exactly forthcoming
UNK: - when we interviewed them earlier. - Yeah.
UNK: That's because you're the Man. But I'm not.
Beckett : I'm in.
Castle : She's in.
Esposito : We heard.
Esposito : You know this isn't her first frat party, Castle.
Castle : You trying to make me feel better?
Ryan : It's understandable ifyou're feeling a little overprotective
