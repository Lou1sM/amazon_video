UNK: But we didn't know ifthey were just messing with our heads,
Emily : 'cause that's what they do here.
Alexis : Did you volunteer for this?
Emily : I needed the money, but now I just wanna go home.
UNK: Wait, you mean there's no panic button?
Castle : There's no safety mechanism ifyou wanna quit?
Emily : There was a white flag, but they removed it when Peter was demoted.
Alexis : Peter was a guard before he was an inmate?
Emily : Head guard, recruited by warden Lillstrom.
Emily : But he was nice to us.
Emily : I think that's why Lillstrom turned on him.
Emily : She made Peter an inmate. Forced him to sit in the chair.
Castle : What chair are we talking about?
Emily : Our daily interrogations.
Emily : We're strapped to a chair.
Emily : Lillstrom flashes images in our eyes over and over.
