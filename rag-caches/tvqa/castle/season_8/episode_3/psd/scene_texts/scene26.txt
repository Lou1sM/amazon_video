Lillstrom : What will it take for you not to tell anyone at Hudson about this?
Beckett : The truth.
Lillstrom : Do I have your word, Captain?
Beckett : Hud U. will never hear from me.
Lillstrom : Okay. I didn't kill Peter. And I wasn't sleeping with him.
UNK: That's all you got?
Beckett : Well, then I'm sending it.
Lillstrom : Look, it's the truth.
Lillstrom : The night Peter escaped, I wasn't even at the prison.
Beckett : Then where were you?
Lillstrom : A pipe burst in my apartment. I was dealing with it all night.
Lillstrom : Check with my doorman.
UNK: But ifyou're thinking
Lillstrom : whoever was having an affair with Peter killed him,
Lillstrom : I might be able to help.
Beckett : Now we're talking.
