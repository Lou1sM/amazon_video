Castle : What's happening is I'm getting her back.
Esposito : Are you sure this is the right way to do it?
Esposito : She was pretty clear that she did not want you working this case.
Castle : Working cases together is why she fell in love with me.
Castle : That's why I'm going to do whatever it takes to solve this case.
