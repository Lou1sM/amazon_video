Castle : No, Beckett, I just want the truth.
Castle : What really happened to Peter that night?
Castle : Peter was placed in this cell.
Beckett : And then he escaped.
Castle : Yeah. But how?
Castle : They said one morning he was just gone.
Beckett : So, what are you thinking?
Beckett : How Peter escaped had something to do with who killed him?
Castle : Only one way to figure it out.
Castle : And guess what, we're gonna figure it out together.
UNK: You're not gonna get a signal.
Beckett : You trapped me in here on purpose.
Castle : No, I didn't. But since you brought it up, tell me,
Castle : why do you feel trapped in our marriage?
Beckett : I don't.
Castle : Then why did you leave?
Beckett : It's complicated.
Castle : So is breaking out of a prison. So we've got some time.
Esposito : You know what, we're not having this conversation.
Beckett : I asked you for space and you literally Iocked me up in a jail cell.
UNK: Okay, wait, wait. Okay, okay. I'll give you space. I'll give you space.
Esposito : You know what? You know, it'd be just my luck.
Beckett : It would ricochet and hit you
Beckett : and then I'd have two murders to contend with.
UNK: Now, look, relax. Peter broke out of here, so, so can we.
UNK: Probably.
Beckett : You're right.
Beckett : I mean, we've been stuck in worse places together before.
UNK: I like that word. "Together."
Castle : So, what happened, Kate? What did I do wrong?
Beckett : Castle, this one's not about you. It's on me.
Beckett : I love you. I always will.
Castle : Then let's work it out. Therapy, counseling, whatever it takes.
Beckett : - I just can't. - Why?
Alexis : - Huh. - "Huh," what?
Beckett : Before this place was a prison cell, it was an office building, right?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : Take a look up.
Beckett : I bet you that's how Peter got out.
Beckett : Come on, Castle.
Beckett : This is when you boost me up.
UNK: Uh, right.
UNK: Ready. Here we go.
UNK: Uh, okay.
UNK: Oh, got it.
UNK: Whew.
