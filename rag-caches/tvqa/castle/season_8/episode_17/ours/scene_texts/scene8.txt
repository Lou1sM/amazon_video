Castle : My back.
Phoebe : I'm going to need that back.
Castle : Sure, let me just dust it off...
UNK: Uh-uh. Hands.
Phoebe : Travis, hurry it up. we've got company.
Phoebe : - Who the hell are you? - Nobody.
Phoebe : - What are you doing here? - Nothing.
Phoebe : So you're nobody doing nothing?
Castle : Pleased to meet you.
Castle : I would love to chat,
Castle : but you are obviously busy,
Castle : whatever clearly legal endeavor you're engaged in.
Genevieve : - You a cop? - No. Not a cop.
UNK: Good.
UNK: Wait. what if I was a cop?
Phoebe : Either way, I'm going to kill you.
Castle : You shoot me, I drop this and it breaks into a million pieces.
Phoebe : It's okay. I've got a dozen more.
Castle : But do they have a genie?
Phoebe : What are you, five years old?
Phoebe : I'm sorry, pal. I've got to do what I got to do.
Castle : I really wish you wouldn't.
Castle : You are a genie.
Castle : Come on.
Castle : - The lamp! But your lamp! It's yours! - Leave it!
Castle : Couldn't you have just flown us out of there on a carpet?
Ryan : What are you talking about?
Castle : - You can't make carpets fly? - Can you?
Castle : - I'm not a genie. - Neither am I.
Castle : That's something a genie would say, because they're liars and tricksters.
UNK: By that logic, any liar can be a genie.
UNK: Well, we've caught you now, and you're not going anywhere.
Castle : The cops are right over there
UNK: and you're gonna tell us everything you know.
Castle : Come on!
UNK: By the time we put a net over the neighborhood,
Ryan : the truck and the treasure were gone.
Ryan : And because you didn't get a license plate,
UNK: we have little chance offinding them.
Castle : It all happened so fast.
