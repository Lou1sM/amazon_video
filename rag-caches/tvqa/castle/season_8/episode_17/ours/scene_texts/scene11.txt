Esposito : on the other side of the city when he was murdered.
UNK: And that makes you and Travis Iittle more than the hired help.
Esposito : So I'd do myself a favor and start talking.
Esposito : Beginning with who you delivered that lamp to.
UNK: I might be "hired help,"
Phoebe : but I ain't no rat.
Phoebe : I want a lawyer.
Phoebe : I know my rights.
UNK: DNA confirms our killer is a woman.
Esposito : But someone with resources and connections, not this flunky.
UNK: A killer who knew Lars.
UNK: A woman who would risk losing the entire shipment
UNK: for the ultimate prize, the lamp.
UNK: And I knowjust the person to lead us to it.
Beckett : Dr. Baker, thank you again for coming to see us.
UNK: Well, how could I resist when you told me
Marion : you found the genie from Aladdin's lamp?
Esposito : That was a little bit of a white lie.
Castle : Yeah, see, we were looking back over Lars' school records from Columbia.
Castle : It turns out he actually audited a class ofyours
Castle : at Hudson University a few years back.
Marion : I have hundreds of students every year.
Marion : I'm afraid I can't remember all of them.
Castle : That's strange, your TA remembers that you and Lars
Castle : would meet regularly during your office hours.
Esposito : In fact, he said that you guys met the morning that Lars returned from Turkey.
Castle : Now, Lars, I'm sure, shared the discovery of the lamp with you,
Castle : knowing that you of all people would appreciate its value.
Castle : But what he wasn't counting on was your professional jealousy.
UNK: Why on earth would I be jealous?
Castle : You've been searching for King Solomon's tomb
UNK: for over 15 years.
