UNK: NYPD!
UNK: NYPD!
Ryan : Are you in here?
Castle : - Clear. - I'm clear.
UNK: Clear.
UNK: Looks like Yuruk skipped town.
Esposito : Why are you playing with the carpets?
UNK: I'm checking ifthey're magic. Think about it.
Castle : Guys, this carpet's bleeding.
Esposito : Check out these bruises, just like Lars.
Ryan : Duct tape on his chest, wrists and ankles.
UNK: Someone must've tied him up, too.
UNK: So, apart from the fully detached head, the MO is identical to Lars.
UNK: Tortured, then killed.
Ryan : Clearly, Yuruk's not our killer.
UNK: Well, the true killer must've tortured Lars to get to Yuruk.
Ryan : Then tortured Yuruk to get to those stolen antiquities.
UNK: His body's still warm. The killer was just here.
Esposito : - Castle, go call for backup. - Wait for them out front.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Hey, Beckett. Yeah. No, right now they're securing the back.
UNK: AII right, we'll be here.
Marion : The genie.
Castle : I knew it was you.
Castle : You are not who I thought you were. I am so sorry. Have a lovely day.
