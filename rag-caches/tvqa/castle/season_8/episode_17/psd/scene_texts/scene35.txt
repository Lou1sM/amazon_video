Castle : Did she manage to get a match?
Ryan : No, but she was able to determine that the killer was a female.
Castle : Most likely the woman holding me at gunpoint.
Ryan : Or your magical blonde genie.
Esposito : - The one only Castle's seen. - Mmm.
UNK: Wait a minute. So neither ofyou believe me?
Esposito : No, bro, I do believe you.
Esposito : Actually, I was able to ID the genie based on your description.
Castle : Good work.
Castle : Laugh it up, you guys.
Castle : I still have two wishes left, and I'm not above using them for evil.
Alexis : - Dad. - Ah! Alexis. Good. Great.
Castle : Tell these guys I am not crazy for believing in a genie.
Castle : And before you answer, remember I spent six months
Castle : making an extra lunch for your imaginary friend.
Castle : - Really? - Guys, I was seven.
Alexis : But you're not crazy.
Alexis : The mystery blonde is real.
Castle : - Thank you. - But she's not a genie.
Alexis : Her name is Genevieve Sutton. She has an office on Second Avenue.
