UNK: I'm gonna take that as a maybe.
UNK: I'd apologize, but his behavior is the least ofyour worries.
UNK: You are accused oftwo homicides
Beckett : and connected to the theft and trafficking
Beckett : of millions of dollars in antiquities.
Beckett : So, your best bet is to start talking.
Genevieve : Look, I didn't kill anyone.
Genevieve : And I was trying to keep the relics from falling into the wrong hands.
UNK: And I would've, too,
Genevieve : if I hadn't had to save your reality-challenged husband.
UNK: I prefer "fantasy-augmented."
UNK: what do you mean by "wrong hands"?
Genevieve : Lars was hired to excavate the antiquities in order to protect them.
Beckett : Hired by who?
Genevieve : An anonymous benefactor. Let's call him Mr. X.
Genevieve : With the Syrian conflict threatening to spill over into Turkey,
Genevieve : Mr. X became concerned that Solomon's tomb would be destroyed,
Genevieve : or worse, looted,
Genevieve : and the relics sold to fund terrorism.
UNK: And you knew all of this? How?
