Mark : He was acting all paranoid.
UNK: He had smuggled something back from Turkey,
Mark : and his partner thought he had double-crossed him...
Ryan : Hold on, what partner?
Mark : I don't know. I don't know.
Mark : Honestly, I just thought he was making it all up
Mark : so that he wouldn't have to pay me.
Ryan : I bet that pissed you off, huh?
UNK: No... well, yeah, it did, but I didn't kill him.
UNK: AII right? I just took his laptop as collateral...
Mark : Is that why he was killed?
Ryan : We're going to need that laptop.
Beckett : Mark's alibi checks out. He was telling the truth.
Castle : So, what do you think Lars was smuggling?
Beckett : Well, he was in Turkey, which is the heroin pipeline from Afghanistan.
UNK: - Hmm. No. It wasn't drugs. - Why not?
Castle : Because Lars was beheaded by a scimitar.
Castle : The storyteller inside me craves an explanation far more...
Beckett : - Farfetched? - Yeah.
Beckett : Pirates' booty, cold fusion, alien cadavers.
Castle : No, those are all ridiculous theories.
Castle : Did you say alien cadavers, though?
Castle : Because I saw a documentary once...
Beckett : Hey, Castle, um, what was the name of that woman that you interviewed?
UNK: - Lars' neighbor. - I didn't get her name.
Beckett : I think my unis forgot to put her statement in this file.
