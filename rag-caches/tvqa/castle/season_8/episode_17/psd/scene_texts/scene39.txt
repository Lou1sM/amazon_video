Genevieve : in order to ensure Lars recovered the artifacts from Yuruk.
Beckett : But, instead, Lars ended up dead.
UNK: Unfortunately.
Genevieve : The night that Lars was murdered, I was pulled away on a false lead.
Genevieve : When I got back, the cops were everywhere.

Castle : as you were saving me?
Genevieve : No. But I did before I saved you.
