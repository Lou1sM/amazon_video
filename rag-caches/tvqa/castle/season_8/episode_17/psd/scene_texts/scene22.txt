UNK: that an AI Aiden checked into Room 57 this morning.
Esposito : We're on our way to the room now.
Beckett : - Mike Harlin? - Oh!
UNK: NYPD!
Ryan : - Hey! Away from the window. Now! - Okay, okay!
Ryan : - Get on your knees, right now! - Okay, okay. Chill, man.
Esposito : Interlace your fingers behind your head.
UNK: AII right.
Mike : I knew she'd lead you to me.
UNK: Who? what are you talking about?
Mike : The genie, man. She's out to get me.
Mike : Genies are evil,

UNK: Aha.
Castle : I see what's happening here.
Castle : The wandering ronin genie is angry with Harlin for killing her master.
