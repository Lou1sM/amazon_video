Castle : forcing him to keep her alive till the next night
Castle : so she could finish the story.
Castle : She told him a new story every night for 1,001 nights,
Castle : until, finally, the king married her.
Castle : Which really says a lot about the power of a good storyteller.
Ryan : Yet tells us nothing about why our victim was killed.
Castle : Or does it? Our victim was tortured
Castle : because the killer, like the king, wanted something.
Ryan : Well, our victim's sister is meeting me in the precinct.
Ryan : Maybe she can shed some light on what that thing was.
UNK: I'll pull a warrant for Lars' new safe-deposit box.
UNK: See ifthere's a clue as to what our killer was after.
Castle : Oh! This is Oprah's assistant.
UNK: Um. I'll take this. You guys head out without me.
UNK: I'll be heading to the precinct in just a little while.
Castle : Guys, these are comedy gold. Seriously.
UNK: - Hello? Hang on, I can't hear you. - Not funny.
Lanie : - I know. - Just one second.
UNK: Are you getting reception? Thank you.
UNK: Hello? Yes.
Castle : Well, actually, it's not about one of my books.
Castle : It's about my mother's.
Castle : No, I only wish I was joking.
Genevieve : - Are you a cop? - Geez.
Genevieve : I don't recognize you. And I've lived in this building for years.
Castle : I'm actually with the cops.
UNK: - I can send the manuscript? - I know who the killer is.
UNK: Can you... Can you... Hold one moment.
UNK: It was Lars' ex-boyfriend, Mark.
UNK: Last night around 9 : 00, Mark was banging on Lars' door.
Genevieve : Said Lars owed him money.
Genevieve : And that he better pay up or else...
Castle : Hang on.
Castle : Can I call you right...
