UNK: Both.
Ryan : Jenny can't sleep.
Ryan : Which, in her crazy, nine-months-pregnant logic
UNK: means, out of solidarity, I'm not allowed to sleep either.
UNK: Well, it could be worse. You could be granted the eternal sleep
UNK: Iike our victim, whose name is...
UNK: Javier Esposito : Lars Cross.
UNK: Javier Esposito : He's a sonar technician for an oil exploration company.
Ryan : Yeah, Chesapeake Energy.
Ryan : Apparently, he was doing an overseas job for them in Turkey,
Ryan : but he got fired for missing too much work.
Ryan : According to his passport, he only got back to the States three days ago.
Castle : If he was just fired, how could he afford all those wonderful new toys?
UNK: That's nothing. He's got a brand-new Porsche 911 downstairs
Esposito : that he apparently paid cash for.
UNK: And he just leased a safe-deposit box at a bank down the street.
Castle : Well, detectives, I deduce that our victim's sudden influx of cash
Castle : had something to do with the fact that he...
Castle : Has no head!
UNK: Dudes, seriously. Give a guy a heads-up.
UNK: Lanie Parish : - Make way, Castle. - Ugh!
Lanie : Time of death between 10 : 00 p.m. and midnight.
Lanie : Lars was strapped to that chair with duct tape.
Lanie : Perimortem bruising indicates that he was tortured
Lanie : before the killer decapitated him with...
Castle : - A Turkish scimitar! - Ah!
Lanie : I checked, no fingerprints.
Lanie : It's from the victim's collection.
UNK: Apparently, Lars is really into the Middle East.
Castle : A region known for its sordid history of beheading.
Castle : And yet, Lars was beheaded here in Manhattan. Hmm.
Castle : Perhaps Lars made the mistake of telling the king the ending of the story.
