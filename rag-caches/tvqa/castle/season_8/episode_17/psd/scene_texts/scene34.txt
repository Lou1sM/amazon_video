Castle : You are a genie.
Castle : Come on.
Castle : - The lamp! But your lamp! It's yours! - Leave it!
Castle : Couldn't you have just flown us out of there on a carpet?
Ryan : What are you talking about?
Castle : - You can't make carpets fly? - Can you?
Castle : - I'm not a genie. - Neither am I.
Castle : That's something a genie would say, because they're liars and tricksters.
UNK: By that logic, any liar can be a genie.
UNK: Well, we've caught you now, and you're not going anywhere.
Castle : The cops are right over there
UNK: and you're gonna tell us everything you know.
Castle : Come on!
UNK: By the time we put a net over the neighborhood,
Ryan : the truck and the treasure were gone.
Ryan : And because you didn't get a license plate,
UNK: we have little chance offinding them.
Castle : It all happened so fast.
Ryan : Oh, right. And yet you did have time to creep over to the lamp,
Ryan : examine it, get held at gunpoint,
Ryan : rub the lamp, make a wish upon the lamp
Ryan : and have a genie appear in a puff of smoke
UNK: and knock the "woman thug" over the head with a 2x4.
Castle : You forgot the part where it was dark and super dusty.
Ryan : Castle, you're just lucky that Lanie was able to pull DNA offYuruk's body.
