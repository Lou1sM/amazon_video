Beckett : Hey, guys, any leads on who the financier is?
Esposito : No, whoever paid for Lars and Harlin's tomb raiding
Esposito : made sure to cover their tracks.
Ryan : Well, Harlin's alibi checked out.
Esposito : Which means that this mystery shipper is our prime suspect.
Ryan : If he was extorting Lars, he'd have plenty of motive for murder.
Beckett : Okay, check in with Customs.
UNK: Let's get a list of all of the ships
Beckett : that have come in from Turkey in the last week.
UNK: Ifwe can track down those antiquities, that should lead us to the killer.
