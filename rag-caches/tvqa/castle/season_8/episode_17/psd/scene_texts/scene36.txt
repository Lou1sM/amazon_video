UNK: A fixer, by the sound of it.
Esposito : How did you get this info, Alexis?

Castle : So, she's not a genie.
Esposito : I'm sorry.
Castle : Genevieve is short for Genie.

UNK: Mmm-hmm. But why would a genie want to do that?
Ryan : Oh, seriously, who cares? Make-believe time with Castle is over.
