UNK: Oh. well, I don't need a genie to grant that wish.
UNK: Hey, Cap. So, we cross-checked Customs' records
Esposito : with the date that Harlin said Lars shipped the antiquities.
Ryan : One ship left port that day in Istanbul
Ryan : and the only cargo that it dropped off in New York
Ryan : was a shipment to this man. Yuruk Sezen.
Ryan : He runs a rug import business with a storefront in SoHo.
Beckett : So, obviously, he's our shipper.
Esposito : Yeah, we're headed there now. Hopefully he still has the antiquities.
Ryan : Including the, uh, magic lamp.
UNK: Guys, guys. Ifyou find that lamp and Castle's not there,
Beckett : I'm never going to hear the end of it.
Esposito : We'll have him meet us there.
Beckett : Okay, great. Oh...
Beckett : Can you make sure that he gets dibs on the first rub, please?
UNK: - Mmm-hmm. - Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Good. Thanks. I owe you.
Beckett : I can't believe I said that.
UNK: NYPD!
UNK: NYPD!
Ryan : Are you in here?
Castle : - Clear. - I'm clear.
UNK: Clear.
UNK: Looks like Yuruk skipped town.
Esposito : Why are you playing with the carpets?
UNK: I'm checking ifthey're magic. Think about it.
Castle : Guys, this carpet's bleeding.
Esposito : Check out these bruises, just like Lars.
Ryan : Duct tape on his chest, wrists and ankles.
UNK: Someone must've tied him up, too.
UNK: So, apart from the fully detached head, the MO is identical to Lars.
UNK: Tortured, then killed.
Ryan : Clearly, Yuruk's not our killer.
UNK: Well, the true killer must've tortured Lars to get to Yuruk.
Ryan : Then tortured Yuruk to get to those stolen antiquities.
UNK: His body's still warm. The killer was just here.
Esposito : - Castle, go call for backup. - Wait for them out front.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Hey, Beckett. Yeah. No, right now they're securing the back.
UNK: AII right, we'll be here.
Marion : The genie.
Castle : I knew it was you.
Castle : You are not who I thought you were. I am so sorry. Have a lovely day.
