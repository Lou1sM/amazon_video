Beckett : I swear, most of my time is spent checking people's paperwork.
Castle : You're suffering from a little buyer's remorse.
Castle : Yeah, it's one of life's cruel jokes.
Castle : You get exactly what you wished for,
UNK: only to find that it wasn't what you wanted at all.
Beckett : No, I love being a captain.
Beckett : It's just sometimes it feels like I'm more of a kindergarten teacher.
UNK: - I'm a sergeant, Kevin. - Hey!
Esposito : I just broke this case wide open.
Ryan : Actually, I did. So, I'll go first.
Esposito : No, I think I'll go first. Mine's bigger than yours.
UNK: Yeah, you wish, pal.
Beckett : Guys, play nice. Indoor voices. Espo goes first.
Esposito : See, she knows.
UNK: So, I opened Lars' safe-deposit box and found 400 G's in cash.
Esposito : Gots to be drug money. Beat that.
UNK: Easy. I got Lars' encrypted laptop from Mark,
Ryan : found out what he was smuggling, and it wasn't drugs.
UNK: What?
UNK: No.
Castle : Lars wasn't a drug dealer,
Castle : he was a tomb raider.
Castle : Ryan, can you zoom in on that, please?
Castle : I've seen that symbol.
Castle : Yes. Um...
UNK: At Lars' apartment...
UNK: You remember all those books on The 1,001 Arabian Nights?
Castle : I think that symbol
Castle : was on one of the books.
Castle : Yes. Here it is.
