Castle : but you sure as hell are not Lars' neighbor.
Castle : - I'm calling the police. - Ifyou do, I'm out that door.
Genevieve : And you'll never know how powerful of an ally I can be.
UNK: AII right, you've got one minute to convince me. Go.
Genevieve : My name is Lindsay Dillon.
Genevieve : I'm a journalist researching a story about looted antiquities.
Genevieve : A source in Turkey hinted that
UNK: Lars may have discovered King Solomon's tomb,
Genevieve : so I decided to keep tabs on him.
Genevieve : That's when I overheard the fight he had with his ex-boyfriend.
Castle : So why not tell the police? why lie?
Genevieve : Because when you've got a dead body,
Genevieve : a story about stolen relics turns from a back-page snoozer
UNK: to a front-page lead just like that.
Genevieve : And though I wanted to be helpful to your murder investigation...
UNK: Ifyou made an official statement,
Castle : every reporter would hear about your story
Castle : and you'd lose your exclusive.
Genevieve : See, I knew you'd get it.
Castle : That doesn't explain why you broke into my office...
Castle : Unless you have another lead.
Genevieve : We're both writers, Iet's help each other out.
Genevieve : Only you've got to keep me as your anonymous source. Deal?
UNK: Deal. what do you got?
Genevieve : Lars was working with a guy named Mike Harlin.
Castle : Yeah, we know about him already, but he's missing.
Castle : Unless you know where he's been hiding.
Genevieve : No, but I do know that Harlin used an alias while in Turkey.
UNK: AI Aiden.
UNK: This is great. I'm gonna call this in.
UNK: AI Aiden. Aladdin. Yeah, that's cute.
Castle : Beckett. Hey. I have a lead for you. It's...
UNK: Hang on a second.
Castle : - Stop that woman. - What woman?
Castle : The blonde woman. The woman who just...
Castle : How did she get past you?
