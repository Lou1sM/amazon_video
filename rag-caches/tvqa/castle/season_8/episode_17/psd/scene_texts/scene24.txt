Mike : Lars came to me, he was all excited.
Ryan : Because he found the location of King Solomon's tomb.
Ryan : And you used your skills as an excavator to help him dig it up.
Mike : No, no. It wasn't that easy.
Mike : We needed money to do it safely. Okay?
Mike : So, Lars, he found some guy.
UNK: He offered us $250K each in cash to do the dig.
UNK: The catch was, ifwe found something, well, Lars had to ship it to the guy
UNK: who's here in New York.
Esposito : - Okay, so who is this financier? - I don't know.
Mike : Look, the money was too good, so I didn't ask any questions.
Mike : I wish I did, though,
Mike : 'cause opening that tomb was the worst thing that happened to us.
Mike : I mean, the moment we took that lamp,
Mike : that genie unleashed its vengeance, man.
Esposito : You can't honestly be trying to tell us that you saw a genie.
Mike : No. But genies can choose to appear or not to appear to anyone they want.
Castle : That's true.
Castle : Professor Baker told me that, and she's a doctor.
UNK: So...
Mike : Guys, I didn't believe in genies either, okay, until my life fell apart.
Mike : I found my girlfriend in bed with my roommate.
Mike : And then I stayed with my mom
UNK: and my mom accidentally threw out the duffle bag with my 250 G's.
Mike : And when I think that things, they can't get any worse,
Mike : I found out that Lars got his head lopped off.
Mike : And now that genie, that crazy, evil genie is after me, man. I know it.
UNK: Okay, Harlin, I'm gonna have to get you off the crazy train
Esposito : that you're riding on right now.
Ryan : Yeah, we know that the shipment got screwed up
