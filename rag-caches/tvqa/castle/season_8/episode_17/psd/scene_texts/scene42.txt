UNK: And I knowjust the person to lead us to it.
Beckett : Dr. Baker, thank you again for coming to see us.
UNK: Well, how could I resist when you told me
Marion : you found the genie from Aladdin's lamp?
Esposito : That was a little bit of a white lie.
Castle : Yeah, see, we were looking back over Lars' school records from Columbia.
Castle : It turns out he actually audited a class ofyours
Castle : at Hudson University a few years back.
Marion : I have hundreds of students every year.
Marion : I'm afraid I can't remember all of them.
Castle : That's strange, your TA remembers that you and Lars
Castle : would meet regularly during your office hours.
Esposito : In fact, he said that you guys met the morning that Lars returned from Turkey.
Castle : Now, Lars, I'm sure, shared the discovery of the lamp with you,
Castle : knowing that you of all people would appreciate its value.
Castle : But what he wasn't counting on was your professional jealousy.
UNK: Why on earth would I be jealous?
Castle : You've been searching for King Solomon's tomb
UNK: for over 15 years.
Castle : We talked to the dean ofyour department.
Castle : He told us about your obsession,
Castle : how it ruined your marriage and nearly destroyed you.
Marion : That is not true.
Esposito : Because you never found that tomb.
Castle : Now, that must have been a bitter pill to swallow,
Castle : knowing that Lars used all ofyour hard-earned research
UNK: to find something you never could.
Castle : And now he was going to get all the fame and fortune
Castle : that you never would.
Marion : Mr. Castle, you really do have an overactive imagination.
