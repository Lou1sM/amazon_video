Beckett : That's it, I'm cutting you off.
Beckett : No, no, no. She's giving me clues, Beckett.
Castle : She wants me to find the lamp...
Castle : I think she wants me to be her new master.
Beckett : And you know what I think?
Beckett : You need to call me the next time you see her,
Beckett : so I can question her.
UNK: I've got to come up with a wish list. Oh, my God, I have so many.
Castle : How am I going to whittle it down to three?
Beckett : - That's funny, I just have one. - What's that?
Beckett : That my man would stop talking about being some skeezy blonde's master
Beckett : and would start talking about taking his wife to bed.
