Beckett : - Who are you? - Whoa. Easy now.
UNK: Whoa. No, no, no. Kate, Kate, Kate, this is Mason wood.
Castle : He's the head of the Greatest Detective Society.
Castle : I told you about meeting him in LA.
Beckett : That doesn't mean that we can trust him.
Mason : Fine, don't trust me.
Mason : But would you mind pointing that thing away from me?
Mason : It makes me just a bit nervous.
Castle : Don't worry, she's out of bullets.
Beckett : Why would you tell him that?
Castle : Because he saved our lives, and he's a friend.
Beckett : Who just happened to be at the right place, at the right time,
UNK: with the right Korean BBQ taco truck?
Beckett : I don't think so.
Castle : She does make a good point. Mason, what are you doing here?
Mason : Your mother sent me.
Castle : My mother?
Beckett : You know Martha?
Mason : No, not that mother, the other one. The stepmother, Rita.
