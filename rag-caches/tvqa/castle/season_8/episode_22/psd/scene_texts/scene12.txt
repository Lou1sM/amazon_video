UNK: My guess is Mr. Right-Hand Man anticipated our ability
Beckett : to track down his vehicle from the crime scene,
Beckett : and he led us to a place where he knew he could lose us.
Esposito : And your guess would be right.
Esposito : Surveillance cameras on the street behind the house
Esposito : were disabled yesterday morning.
Ryan : So our guy walked right in the front door,
UNK: walked right out the back.
UNK: Which means we have no way of knowing where he went.
