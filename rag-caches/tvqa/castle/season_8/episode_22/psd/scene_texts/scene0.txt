UNK: Kate Beckett : Okay, it's almost time.
UNK: AII right. Shall we review?
UNK: Please.
UNK: Allright, according to Caleb,
UNK: this phone is gonna ring at exactly 8 : 00 a.m.
UNK: Now, because it's GPS-enabled, it will only work in this particular park.
Castle : At which time an electronicallyaltered voice,
Castle : most likely LokSat's, will issue Caleb his orders.
Vikram : Orders that I'll intercept and trace with a cellular relay.
UNK: Okay, I'm gonna attach you to the relay.
Beckett : You connected, Vikram?
UNK: Synced up and ready to go.
Vikram : Guys, this is it.
Vikram : If all goes well, we'll identify LokSat and finally take his ass down.
Beckett : And if anything goes sideways, we immediately shut it down
Beckett : and meet up at the precinct. Got it?
Vikram : Roger that.
UNK: - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Mmm-hmm.
Castle : You want a Fudgsicle, too?
Castle : I know. Could be a trap.
Beckett : Just because Caleb switched sides,
Beckett : doesn't mean that LokSat doesn't have him under surveillance.
Beckett : Any one of these people could be a LokSat agent,
Beckett : or even LokSat himself.
Castle : You care to put a wager on it?
Beckett : Wager on what?
Castle : On which one's LokSat.
UNK: I got 20 bucks says it's that handsy yogi over there.
Beckett : I'm going for the Carrot Top Cruella de Vil.
Beckett : Wait a minute, does she look a bit like your first ex-wife?
Castle : She kind of does. Oh, my God.
Castle : Could my ex-wife be LokSat?
UNK: 'Cause in a lot ofways, that would make perfect sense.
UNK: AII right, Vikram. Here we go.
