Ryan : It rained last night, so clearly these tracks were made afterwards.
Esposito : Might be from the killer walking to his getaway car.
Ryan : Yeah. You know, why don't we make impressions
UNK: of all the shoe prints and tire tracks?
Ryan : Maybe we'll get lucky.
UNK: Hayley Shipton : And what do I need these for?
Castle : Like I said, you're the lookout.
Castle : When we do our surveillance of LokSat's accountant,
UNK: we're gonna need you to find a high vantage point,
Castle : be our eye in the sky.
Castle : There's not a guitar in there, is there?
Hayley : Not the kind that plays music.
Castle : - Uh, Hayley. - Hmm.
Castle : In case anything goes wrong...
Hayley : I will get Martha and Alexis here and I will protect them.
Hayley : You have my word.
Castle : Thank you. I owe you one.
Castle : And by one, I mean more like one dozen.
UNK: Mmm.
Vikram : After we take down LokSat,
UNK: I am thinking I might tender my resignation.
Beckett : So you want to go back to being a government analyst?
Vikram : I want to go back to being boring. Kind offorgotten what that feels like.
Vikram : I know that probably sounds stupid.
