Vikram : The call was short.
UNK: Wait, I got something.
Vikram : Oh, no. It says here the call originated in DYE-2.
Beckett : Uh, what's that?
Vikram : It's an abandoned Cold war radar station in the Arctic Circle.
UNK: LokSatmust've set up a cellularrelay there.
Vikram : Guys, this is a dead end.
UNK: Or is it an opportunity? We all heard Caleb's instructions.
Beckett : LokSat's accountant is going to expose himself at that dead drop.
Castle : Talk about high on the food chain. Ifwe get LokSat's accountant...
Beckett : It could bring us one step closer to LokSat himself.
Beckett : Vikram, send an encrypted email to Caleb.
UNK: He's gonna have to show up at that dead drop.
Beckett : And you have to get ahold of Hayley. We need all the help we can get.
