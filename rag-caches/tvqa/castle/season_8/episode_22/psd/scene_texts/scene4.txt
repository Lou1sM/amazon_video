Beckett : No. No, not at all.
Beckett : Thank you for doing this with me.
Vikram : Are you kidding? Thank you for everything.
UNK: We're almost there.
Beckett : Yeah, almost.
Beckett : Speaking of, we should head out.
Esposito : Hey, Cap.
Esposito : I'm sorry. Are we... Are we interrupting something?
Beckett : Uh, no, what's going on?
Ryan : Well, we got a lead on our homicide.
Ryan : The tire impressions made by our killer's getaway car
Ryan : show that the wheels were staggered,
UNK: meaning the ones in back were larger than the ones up front.
Beckett : So the car's exotic?
UNK: Well, specifically, it means that the car was either mid or rear engine.
Ryan : So even though we don't have any traffic cams
Ryan : from near the crime scene,
Ryan : we can scrub footage from the surrounding areas and...
UNK: And hopefully find a car that fits the bill.
Beckett : Okay, good job. I'll leave you guys to it.
Esposito : Yo, Beckett.
Esposito : Is there something going on that we should know about?
UNK: No.
