UNK: Right.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : But these feelings make you vulnerable. Surely, you must see that.
UNK: Yeah, well, what's the alternative?
Castle : To be like you? A man alone, without empathy?
UNK: Mr. Flynn : She's the reason you are on this table.
UNK: Ifyou'd never met her, you'd most likely have a very long life ahead ofyou.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : Surely, you would take a do-over, if offered.
Castle : No, I wouldn't.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : - Interesting. - She's gonna find you.
Castle : You and LokSat. And she's gonna bury you both.
Castle : And I can't tell a lie, right?
UNK: Mr. Flynn : Yes, but the fact that you believe it, does not make it the truth.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : Kate Beckett is going to be dead by the end of the night,
UNK: Mr. Flynn : and there is nothing you can do about it.
