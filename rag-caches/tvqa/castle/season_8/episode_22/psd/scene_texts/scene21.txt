UNK: Mr. Flynn : I've read your files.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : You were an incorrigible playboy before you met Katherine Beckett.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : What changed?
Castle : I fell in love with her.
UNK: Why?
Castle : Because I'd never met anyone like her.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : Well, you've never met anyone like me.
Castle : Yeah, but you don't have the legs,
Castle : or the eyes, or the brains, or the heart.
Castle : Beckett makes me laugh. She challenges me.
Castle : I became a better man... why am I telling you this?
