UNK: Whew.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : That was difficult to watch.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : I'm sure you're finding it hard to live with yourself.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : It's understandable,
UNK: Mr. Flynn : knowing what's coming next for your loved ones.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : This will end your pain.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : This will end everything.
UNK: NYPD.
Esposito : We have reason to believe there's a murder suspect in this building.
Esposito : We need to search it from top to bottom.
Receptionist : Sorry, Officer, but that's not going to happen.
Receptionist : This building belongs to the Central Intelligence Agency.
Receptionist : It's protected by the National Security Act. I can't let you in.
Castle : I don't care if it's protected by the Hulk.
UNK: We're gonna tear this place apart.
UNK: Hands in the air!
Esposito : Where is this guy?
Esposito : Where is he?
Castle : What, no alcohol swab this time?
UNK: No need. This stuffwill kill you in about 12 seconds.
UNK: Or, and just go with me on this, we could skip it.
Castle : There's no reason this has to end in tragedy.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : Everything ends in tragedy, even an epic love story like yours.
UNK: NYPD! Hands in the air, now!
UNK: Mr. Flynn : - Of course. I just need to turn this... - Ryan!
UNK: - Are you okay? - Mason wood is LokSat.
Castle : He's going after Beckett. He's gonna kill her.
Castle : We have to warn her.
Esposito : Dispatch, this is Esposito. I need backup...
UNK: This building is a black site.
UNK: AII cell and radio communications are jammed.
UNK: - We gotta go. - Let's move!
UNK: Go!
Castle : Call them off!
UNK: Mr. Flynn : They wouldn't listen even if I asked them to.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : Which I won't.
UNK: Where's Mason taking Beckett to kill her?
UNK: Mr. Flynn : I have no idea.
Castle : We'll see.
Castle : I sure hope I get the correct dosage,
Castle : because forgetting to breathe can be such a drag.
UNK: Now you're gonna tell me everything I wanna know.
Castle : Where is Mason taking Beckett?
UNK: Where?
UNK: Here.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : There's a kill room in the basement with an incinerator.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : That's where you were going to end up afterwards.
Castle : How do I get a message to Beckett?
UNK: Mr. Flynn : You can't. I told you.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : They shut down all the signals the second the police arrived.
Castle : How do we get out of here?
Castle : You don't.
UNK: Mr. Flynn : That door is the only way out,
UNK: Mr. Flynn : and they have more bullets than you.
Mason : You and Mr. Castle have quite a bond.
UNK: Unusual in your line ofwork.
UNK: Yeah, I'm crazy for him. He's the love of my life.
Beckett : And he understands the sacrifices that I have to make to do this job, so.
Mason : Clearly whomever you're up against is quite deadly.
UNK: Ever considerjust walking away?
Beckett : Every day.
Mason : Why didn't you?
Beckett : I took an oath.
Beckett : People that I cared about were murdered,
Beckett : and they deserve justice.
Mason : Must be hard carrying that weight.
Beckett : I don't carry it alone.
Mason : Here we are.
