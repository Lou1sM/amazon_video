Castle : There she is.
Castle : She looks nice.
Alan : This is a huge mistake. I'm a safety inspector.
Alan : That's not even a little sexy. This is so much scarier than dying.
Castle : You are Alan Masters, superhero.
Castle : Chicks dig superheroes.
Alan : Should I tell her I'm a superhero?
Castle : I wouldn't open with that.
UNK: Okay.
Alan : I'm going in. wish me luck.
Castle : Good luck.
Alan : - Hi, Gwen. - Hi.
Alan : - Wow. You... - Good to see you.
UNK: Oh.
Alan : You look great. Thanks for having dinner with me.
Gwen : I was surprised that you called after the day you've had.
Alan : What a day, right? Crazy, Just nuts. I...
Alan : I'm a superhero.
UNK: What?
Alan : Nothing. I sneezed.
Gwen : You sneezed "I'm a superhero"?
UNK: Allergies.
Alan : Superhero! Excuse me.
UNK: Help.
Castle : Hey, Ryan.
Ryan : We ID'd the owner of Bullseye waste Management.
Ryan : He's a guy named Horatio Spate.
UNK: That's a good supervillain name.
Ryan : This is not a joke.
Ryan : Spate is suspected of executing over a dozen people.
Ryan : I texted you his picture, just to put him on your radar.
Ryan : Whatever you do, don't leave the loft.
Castle : Don't leave the loft. Got it.
UNK: Wait, what's that noise?
UNK: Uh...
GwEN : Like actually electrocuted, Iike unconscious?
UNK: Crap.
Spate : Hello, Alan.
Alan : Do I know you?
Spate : Sorry to interrupt your romantic dinner.
UNK: Careful, Alan. He's your archnemesis.
Alan : Seriously? I have an archnemesis?
Alan : Is that how they dress?
Gwen : Alan, you're cute and I like you, but this is all a bit much.
Gwen : You say that you're a superhero, and he's a supervillain.
UNK: So does that make you his sidekick?
Castle : Sidekick? Please, I'm the mentor.
Gwen : And I'm his date, or at least I was.
Gwen : I'm sorry, this is just weird.
UNK: And she thinks I'm crazy.
UNK: Thank you so much. This is all your fault.
Castle : Actually, it's his.
Castle : Alan, meet Horatio Spate.
UNK: He is the new owner of Bullseye waste Management.
Alan : So you're the one who's trying to kill me?
Spate : Hardly. If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead already.
Alan : Well, what do you want?
Spate : An arrangement. One that would benefit both of us.
Spate : Twice someone's tried to kill you, and you're still with us.
Spate : How long before Lady Luck abandons you?
Castle : Oh, let me guess. A man like you can offer protection.
Spate : More than offer. I can guarantee it.
Spate : In return, all I ask is that you adopt a more laissez-faire interpretation
UNK: ofyour inspection policies.
Castle : This is a moral test.
Castle : Every superhero is presented with a moral dilemma
UNK: by the villain trying to corrupt him.
UNK: Horatio Spate, my answer is no.
Castle : Gun! Gun!
Spate : Relax, boys.
Spate : It's gingko. Just started taking it.
Spate : Here's what it does. It improves memory, it sharpens brain function.
Spate : And it helps a person make really, really good decisions.
