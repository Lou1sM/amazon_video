Beckett : Yeah, true. why don't you guys head down to the second floor,
Beckett : see if Organized Crime has any insight?
UNK: AII right.
Castle : We know you can survive poisoning and electrocution.
Castle : Now it's time to see ifyou can survive penetrative wounds.
UNK: How about ifwe start with something smaller? Like a paper cut?
Castle : Okay, this is all a little overwhelming. I understand.
UNK: AII right. Let's... Let's test for some other powers first.
UNK: Telekinesis. Try to move the piano with your mind.
Alan : Oh. If I try this, will you tell me about Gwen?
UNK: Deal.
UNK: Ow!
Esposito : What the hell?
Castle : That was a trick. I was actually testing for Spidey-Sense.
Alan : I don't have it.
UNK: Clearly.
Alan : - Can we take a break, please? - Fine.
UNK: Hit me in the head.
UNK: Here.
UNK: - Uh, no, no, I don't drink. - AII right.
UNK: Do you wanna know what Gwen said?
Alan : Yes. Finally.
UNK: AII right. I'll tell you.
Castle : - Well? - I'm telling you with my mind.
Castle : - You're not getting it? - No.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Well, bad news is, no telepathy.
Castle : Good news is, I think Gwen is into you. She told me she thinks you're funny.
UNK: Really? Funny ha-ha, not funny strange?
Beckett : - Yeah. - Yeah, what?
Castle : Exactly. So, are you gonna use your double-death as a wake-up call,
Castle : and finally ask her out?
Alan : What if she says no?
Castle : What if she says yes?
UNK: Okay, I'll do it.
Castle : That is the spirit, Alan.
UNK: What? I didn't think you meant right now.
UNK: Alan, there is no time like the present.
UNK: Mmm!
Alan : It's ringing.
Alan : This is very exciting.
Alan : Oh, my God! I'm gonna be sick. I don't know what to say.
Castle : - Just be yourself. - Be myself.
Alan : So, something like, "Hi, this is Alan Masters"
UNK: "from the City Department of Safety Inspection, badge number 6247..."
Castle : New plan, new plan. Do not be yourself. Say this...
UNK: Hi, Gwen! Hello, this is Alan Masters...
UNK: Yes, that's right. I'm much better, thanks. You?
UNK: Oh...
UNK: Nothing. I... I was just calling to see ifyou wanted to have dinner with me.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Okay, I'll see you there. Bye.
UNK: She said yes.
Castle : Well done, Alan.
Castle : Now all we have to do is plan the perfect date.
Castle : How much time do we have?
Alan : Well, we're meeting at Botticelli's in 30 minutes.
Castle : - Tonight? - You said yourself.
Alan : It's time to start living.
Castle : Yes, I just thought it would be after we apprehended your would-be murderer.
Alan : I know. I will just embrace my powers.
Alan : Maybe this is my origin story.
Alan : And my dinner with Gwen will be the beginning of something really terrific!
Castle : That's the spirit, Alan. And I'm going with you.
UNK: Oh, please, don't.
Castle : The first two attempts on your life were meant to be anonymous. Quiet.
Castle : It's very unlikely they'd try something in a public place.
UNK: Exactly.
UNK: Though they did fail twice, they might try to kick it up a notch.
Alan : What are you saying?
Castle : Don't order an appetizer.
Beckett : - You found something? - Yeah.
Vikram : I ran the partial plate from that SUV Caleb Brown got into,
Vikram : generated a list of names.
Vikram : Guess who's on it.
UNK: Brooks. The guy with the bag of spiders who tried to take down Castle and me.
Vikram : If Brooks picked up Caleb at the airport, then this ties Caleb directly to LokSat.
Beckett : Well, look. It's a start, anyway.
Vikram : A start? It's photographic evidence.
UNK: Ofwhat? That he got into a car with a bad guy?
Beckett : Caleb's a public defender. He represents bad guys.
Vikram : He was using an alias.
Vikram : We can use this to go at Caleb, get him to reveal LokSat's identity.
Beckett : Until he alerts LokSat that we're onto him,
Beckett : and then we're all dead.
Beckett : No, we gotta wait until we have something more concrete.
UNK: Fine. Caleb's alias, Peter McCaffrey,
UNK: I'll look in to see what other trips he's taken under that name,
UNK: see if it leads somewhere more definitive.
Beckett : Look, I know this is frustrating, but we're getting close.
Beckett : We just have to tread carefully.
