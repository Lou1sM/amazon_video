UNK: Ah! Castle, there you are. We've got the warrant, let's go.
Esposito : Yeah, where's Alan?
Castle : I thought he was with you guys.
UNK: No.
Beckett : Oh, no!
UNK: Gwen!
Gwen : Alan, what are you doing here?
UNK: Come with me ifyou wanna live.
Gwen : Alan, what is going on?
Alan : Mike Lin is secretly making synthetic heroin in the lab.
Alan : He's the one who's trying to kill me!
Alan : Oh, my God!

Alan : But don't worry, the cops are on the way.

Alan : This will work.

UNK: Ow...
Alan : I thought dying twice was painful.
Gwen : Well, maybe it won't be so bad the third time.
Alan : - Police! - Nobody moves! NYPD!

UNK: Keep your hands where we can see 'em!
UNK: Hands! Hands!
UNK: - Any sign ofAlan? - No, not yet.
Castle : I'm sure he came here. See ifyou can find Gwen's office.
UNK: Alan!
Beckett : Oh, no!

UNK: I forced the superhero mantle onto him.
UNK: I filled his head with crazy ideas of being invulnerable and then...
