Esposito : Mr. Patchett, I'm Detective Esposito.
Esposito : I need to ask you a few questions about Alan Masters.
UNK: Frank Patchett : Is he doing okay? I heard someone tried to kill him.
UNK: Twice.
Esposito : How's the cleanup going?
Frank : Well, we're almost done here.
Frank : Accidents happen. Luckily, nobody was hurt.
Castle : Nobody except Alan.
Frank : You think what happened to him is connected to the spill?
Esposito : Maybe. So why don't you get changed? We can go talk about it.
UNK: Okay. Locker room is over there.
Esposito : We'll go with you.
Castle : Actually, I'm gonna go take a look around.
Castle : Origin story.
