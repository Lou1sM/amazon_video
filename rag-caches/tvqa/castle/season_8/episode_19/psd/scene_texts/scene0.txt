Beckett : What are you doing?
Castle : - Watching you sleep. - Hmm.
Castle : - Is that creepy? - Mmm-mmm.
UNK: I think it's sweet.
Castle : I took some pictures.
Beckett : Less sweet.
Castle : They're part of a series. Usually you don't wake up.
Beckett : And now it's creepy.
Castle : Hey, I've been thinking...
Beckett : Oh, no.
Castle : Oh, relax. I'm over that whole "sex in zero G" thing.
UNK: Good, 'cause that was just an accident waiting to happen.
Castle : Seriously though, I think it's time we shake things up.
Castle : Move to Paris.
Castle : You know, uh, search for buried treasure in Nepal.
Castle : We could fly a hot air balloon across the Sahara.
Beckett : You know what? I love all of those ideas,
Beckett : but I just became Captain, and you have your PI business.
