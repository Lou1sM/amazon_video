UNK: And theyjust dump this stuff into the landfill.
Esposito : So why would they target Alan before you?
Beckett : Because Alan fired Dave Barton, the only inspector that they could buy.
Beckett : So, Alan was becoming a big problem and their only solution was to kill him.
Alan : The mob is trying to kill me?
Castle : Trying and failing. But do you know why?
UNK: Because I'm what, Rogaine Man?
Castle : Yuck, worst name yet.
Castle : But it does explain why you keep coming back to life.
Castle : Your cells regenerate at an amazing rate.
UNK: Except they don't.
UNK: What?
UNK: Just got the tests back.
Lanie : No sign of abnormal regenerative activity in blood or tissue cells.
Lanie : In fact, no sign of anything abnormal at all.
Alan : Told you. I'm Boring Man, except for the contract out on my life.
Castle : Just to be sure,
Castle : maybe we should cut off one of his fingers, see if it grows back.
UNK: What?
Castle : Just the tip.
Alan : Okay, I'm done.
UNK: - Whoa, whoa. where are you gonna go? - Home.
Alan : Or not home. Somewhere safe. Where is that?
Castle : My place. we have yet to unlock the secrets ofyour powers.
UNK: Lanie is a doctor. She can strip you down and check you out.
Alan : - No. - Forget it.
Castle : Come on, you owe him.
Alan : No, no, she doesn't.
Alan : Castle, it's been a long day. I am very overwhelmed.
Alan : I just want to go back to my life.
UNK: It's too bad. You can't.
Castle : Spidey couldn't go back after the bite,
Castle : Hulk couldn't go back after the bomb, Ant-Man couldn't go back after...
Castle : I can't remember. Point is, you have an obligation.
Castle : With great power comes great responsibility.
Castle : Let's go to my place and get some pizza on the way.
UNK: There is no way I'm going back to your place to eat pizza
