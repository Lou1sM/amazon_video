Beckett : Because Lucky Dragon is a legitimate business,
Beckett : and there are small doses of TTX in eastern medicine.
UNK: Hold on, this doesn't make sense.
Esposito : According to intel, the Triad sees Horatio as a threat to their territory.
Esposito : They're gearing up for war.
Ryan : So no way is Horatio guaranteeing Alan's safety with the Triads.
UNK: Unless...
UNK: Horatio said he'd just started taking Gingko.
UNK: What ifthe two empires are hammering out some kind of an alliance?
Esposito : An alliance that Alan unknowingly stumbled onto,
Esposito : and put him right in the crosshairs of the Triad.
Ryan : But what could bring two warring gangs together to join forces?
Beckett : We'll get a search warrant for Lucky Dragon Herbologists and find out.
UNK: Hey.
Beckett : Uh, Caleb, what are you doing here?
Caleb : I hate to bother you, but I could really use your help with a client.
Caleb : Can I borrow you for a quick minute?
Beckett : Yeah, sure.
Beckett : So, who is this client?
Caleb : I think you're familiar with him.
UNK: Peter McCaffrey.
UNK: Uh...
UNK: No, it doesn't sound familiar.
Caleb : No? Let me fill you in.
UNK: Um, so there's this overzealous cop.
