Beckett : We're here to talk about LokSat.
UNK: Uh, what is that?
Beckett : An illegal CIA air fleet used to transport drugs.
Beckett : We tracked a plane's tail number to this private airport and to you.
Pilot : I don't know what you're talking about.
Beckett : I'm sure you've been trained in how to resist interrogation,
UNK: so I'm gonna make this easier for you.
UNK: I'm gonna start counting, and if I make it to five, you're dead.

Beckett : Thank you for taking care of him.
UNK: Yeah, it's a lot ofwork. I don't know how you do it.
Hayley : Well, best of luck to you, Rick. I'm off.
Castle : What about finding your hacker?
