Vikram : Because you're at the center of all this.
Vikram : Which makes you the only person I can trust.
UNK: I haven't seen any of those people in over a year.
Beckett : What makes you think I'm at the heart of this?
UNK: - Who did you tell about me? - Nobody.
Vikram : - Well, they found us somehow. - Follow me.
Beckett : Let's go.
Brooks : They're here somewhere.
Brooks : Check the balcony.
Beckett : Come on.
Beckett : - Get in the car. - What?
Beckett : Get in the car!
UNK: Oh, God. I think I'm gonna hurl.
UNK: - Just try to keep it together. - Oh, I'm definitely gonna hurl.
Beckett : What the hell are you doing?
Vikram : How do you think they found us?
Vikram : They tapped your phone. They used it to track you to me.
Beckett : I've been shot. I need to get to a doctor. And we need to call the cavalry.
UNK: That's gonna be the last call you ever make.
Vikram : Look, whoever these guys are, they are hacked in everywhere.
Vikram : Which means anybody you call is gonna wind up dead.
UNK: I gotta stop this bleeding.
UNK: Dry Cleaner : Can I help you?
UNK: It's okay, listen, I'm a cop.
UNK: I just need a needle and thread,
UNK: and I'm gonna have to detain you for your own safety.
Beckett : Grab her cell phone. Lock her up in the bathroom.
UNK: Sorry.
Beckett : What's wrong with you?
Vikram : Headache and dizzy. I need to eat something.
Beckett : Maybe you should have grabbed some breakfast this morning
Beckett : instead of calling me.
UNK: I'm a diabetic.
