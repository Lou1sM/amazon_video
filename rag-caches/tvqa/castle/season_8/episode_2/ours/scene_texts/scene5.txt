Hayley : There he is.
Alexis : Looks like Beckett's repositioning.
Vikram : Sir, can I have, uh, a shot ofwhiskey, please?
UNK: AII right, Vikram, how's it going?
Vikram : I'm in. Now comes the hard part.
Hayley : Fast forward a little.
UNK: Wait.
UNK: Uh-oh.
Beckett : Vikram, they're here. Get out.
Vikram : I need more time.
UNK: You got maybe 15 seconds.
Beckett : Come on.
Beckett : Come on, Vikram, get out.
Beckett : Come on.
Vikram : Got it.
UNK: Oh.
Alexis : - That was close. - I'll say.
UNK: It's too bad we couldn't see what was on Vikram's computer.
Alexis : Can you rewind a little?
Alexis : Stop. Look in the mirror.
UNK: Can I? Thanks.
Hayley : Okay, that was totally badass.
Vikram : I got the memo.
UNK: And I got them.
Beckett : I followed them to a warehouse,
UNK: and then not long after that, they showed up with Castle.
UNK: They were gonna torture him.
UNK: So, I stepped in, and eventually I took off
Beckett : and went back to that apartment building where you found us.
Rita : I'm impressed. Most people would have been dead within hours.
UNK: AII right, now it's your turn.
Beckett : Who are these guys, and what is LokSat?
Rita : I don't know exactly.
Rita : What I do know is the person behind this
Rita : is a very powerful and a very dirty analyst inside the CIA.
