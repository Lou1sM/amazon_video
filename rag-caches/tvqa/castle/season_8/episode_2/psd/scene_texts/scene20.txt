Beckett : Who's in charge of LokSat? One.
Pilot : - I don't know. I just work here. - Two.
UNK: Beckett, come on. Beckett, please.
UNK: Three.
Beckett : - Four. - Okay, okay.
Pilot : I'll tell you everything.
UNK: Beckett!
UNK: Beckett!
Beckett : Vikram, what have you done?
Vikram : He was reaching for a gun. He was trying to kill you.
Castle : - You can't believe him, Kate. - Castle, what are you doing here?
Castle : Isn't it obvious? I'm rescuing you.
UNK: Rick?
Castle : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. She's cool, she's cool. She's with me.
Castle : But this guy, he's not who he says he is.
Beckett : What are you talking about?
Castle : The AG's office got intel that he is the mole within the Agency.
Vikram : No, that's absurd. Don't you see what's happening?
UNK: Whoever is at the heart of this LokSat memo is trying to discredit me.
Vikram : He's telling the truth.
Hayley : This guy had his gun cocked and ready to fire.
UNK: See?
Vikram : Beckett, please believe me.
Castle : You can't trust him.
UNK: Kate...
Beckett : Yes, I can trust him, and so can you.
Castle : - No, not until we confirm... - Castle.
Beckett : Just shut up and kiss me.
UNK: AII right, all right.
Hayley : This is so heartwarming, you guys.
UNK: Do you think you two could finish this a little later?
Castle : Right, right. Uh, uh, sorry.
Castle : Uh, Beckett, this is Hayley. She's the one who helped me find you.
Beckett : Thank you for taking care of him.
UNK: Yeah, it's a lot ofwork. I don't know how you do it.
Hayley : Well, best of luck to you, Rick. I'm off.
Castle : What about finding your hacker?
UNK: Oh, if he is involved in whatever the hell this is, screw him.
Hayley : Not getting paid enough.
UNK: Well, um, thank you for all your help. It was a pleasure.
Hayley : I'm happy you found her.
UNK: Hey.
Beckett : - What is it? - You tell me.
Rita : I know. I've got a lot of explaining to do.
Castle : You lied to me.
Castle : You looked me right in the eye and you lied.
Castle : Why didn't you tell me about Vikram?
Beckett : - I couldn't. - Come on.
Vikram : The AG's office has strict protocols, Castle.
Castle : You're not with the AG's office anymore.
Beckett : I did what I did to protect you.
Beckett : He gave me a Class Seven distress code.
Beckett : That's life or death. I mean, what did you want me to do?
Castle : Tell me the truth.
Castle : Come on, do you have any idea how worried I was?
Beckett : Yeah, I do. I was gone for 36 hours.
Beckett : A year ago, you were gone for eight weeks.
Beckett : - Eight weeks. - That was different.
Beckett : Sure was. You still don't remember what happened
Beckett : during six of those weeks.
Beckett : And yet, I trusted you. So please, just trust me.
Beckett : I didn't do this to hurt you, I did it to protect you.
Castle : Why am I so angry?
UNK: Yeah, you know what?
Beckett : When the shoe was on the other foot, I felt the same way.
Castle : No, that's not it. It's you. Because I've seen this before.
Beckett : What is that supposed to mean?
Castle : Nothing. Just that we work better as a team.
Beckett : Of course we do.
UNK: Yeah. Together we can figure this out.
Castle : We can figure anything out. Just like always.
Rita : I know.
Beckett : Okay, no more secrets.
Beckett : No more secrets.
Ryan : Let me get this straight. So, you and Vikram here,
Ryan : you're being hunted by a secret death squad
UNK: that's being sanctioned by someone deep inside the CIA.
Ryan : And you don't want any help?
Vikram : Haven't you been paying attention? There is no help.
Esposito : Bro, the AG's office has resources.
