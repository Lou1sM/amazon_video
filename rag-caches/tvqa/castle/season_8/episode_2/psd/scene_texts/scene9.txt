Castle : What did Beckett say that freaked him out so much?
UNK: How do you know aboutLokSat?
Beckett : Doesn't matter how.
UNK: The question is, what is it?
UNK: And why is there a hitsquad running around the East Coast,
Beckett : killing people to protect it?
UNK: LokSat. Never heard of it.
UNK: Me neither. But it clearly scares the hell out of Bracken.
Castle : Figuring out what it means is key.
UNK: And that's exactly what Beckett is doing.
Ryan : Well, why don't we talk to Bracken and find out?
Ryan : No, not you, Castle. You're radioactive with this guy.
Esposito : Yeah, you should stay here and wait for the Assistant AG.
Esposito : She's on her way up from D.C. to bring some federal muscle.
UNK: AII right.
Castle : Hey, Alexis, I have another clue.
Alexis : - So do we. - We?
Alexis : Me and Hayley. Her feelers paid off.
Alexis : Vikram showed up at a hotel in Midtown an hour after they left the prison.
Castle : - Was Beckett with him? - I don'tknow. Wejustgothere.
Alexis : I'll call you as soon as we figure anything out.
UNK: I don't know, Alexis. I don't want you involved in this.
Alexis : Dad, I can take care of myself.
Castle : Alexis, no, it is too dangerous.
Alexis : I'm not a kid anymore, Dad. Beckett's family. I'll call you after.
UNK: Alexis.
Hayley : - Nicely done. - You sure I wasn't too harsh?
UNK: Nah, he's gotta learn. You're an adult now.
Alexis : So how do we do this?
UNK: We talk to the head of security, we get a look at their video surveillance.
Hayley : My source told me that Vikram arrived a little before 4 : 00 p.m. yesterday.
Alexis : Question is, what the hell was he doing here?
