UNK: I don't know what "BD" means.
Castle : It's Esposito.
Castle : - Hey, what's up? - Yo. where are you?
Castle : - At the office. - What are you working on?
Castle : Nothing. You sidelined me, remember?
Esposito : Yeah, well, the Assistant AG is here, Allison Hyde.
Esposito : She wants you to come down to the precinct immediately.
Castle : - I can't. - Castle, you were supposed to wait...
UNK: Look, it's gonna take me half an hour to get there.
Castle : Why don't we just jump on a video conference?
Castle : Give me a minute to dial you in.
UNK: AII right, you two should get out of sight.
UNK: I'm not gonna mention we have this document.
Castle : People connected to this thing are getting killed all over the place.
UNK: So no sense putting ourselves in the crosshairs.
Hayley : - Agreed. - Thanks.
Hyde : Mr. Castle. We never met when you were in D.C., but I read the reports.
UNK: You helped us out of a very tricky situation.
