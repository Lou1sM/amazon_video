Beckett : It started this morning.
Beckett : I was getting ready for work, and then he called.
UNK: Wow.
Castle : What? That was supposed to be a decoder ring in there.
Beckett : Oh, my God. This is so beautiful.
Beckett : Um, would you mind getting that?
UNK: Yeah. Here.
UNK: Thanks. Oh, my God.
Castle : Captain Beckett's phone.
UNK: Uh, Katherine Beckett, please?
Rita : Of course. Please waitjust one moment.
UNK: Okay, I'll trade. There you go. Thanks.
Beckett : Yeah, this is Beckett.
Vikram : This is an emergency alert, classification Protocol Seven.
Beckett : - I don't... - There's no time.
UNK: Rendezvous at the Hill Theater. Come alone. Tell no one.
UNK: Understood.
UNK: Uh, you know, uh, I'm not interested,
Beckett : so why don't you take me off the list?
UNK: Thanks.
Beckett : Telemarketers. I swear, there should be tougher laws against them.
UNK: Wow. I love this. I'm gonna cherish this.
UNK: Thank you. Mmm.
Beckett : Okay, I've got to get moving. I have a meeting over at One PP.
UNK: Knock 'em dead.
Beckett : Show me your hands.
Vikram : - They're all dead. - I said show me your hands.
Beckett : Don't move.
Vikram : I'm not carrying. I'm just an analyst. I'm a data cruncher at the AG's office.
Beckett : I don't remember you.
Vikrum : I started working a few months ago. Now they're all dead.
UNK: Who?
Vikram : McCord, Hendricks, your entire former team.
Vikram : - How? - One was stabbed at a bar.
Vikram : The others were killed in a car crash.
Vikram : But it wasn't an accident. They were all murdered.
Beckett : How do you know that?
Vikram : Because someone tried to kill me yesterday, too.
Beckett : So then why didn't you pull the fire alarm?
Beckett : The FBI, the NSA?
Vikram : Because you're at the center of all this.
Vikram : Which makes you the only person I can trust.
UNK: I haven't seen any of those people in over a year.
