UNK: Richard Castle : So what do we know?
UNK: Alexis Castle : Last night, Beckett's old team from the Attorney General's office was killed.
UNK: Right. And then this morning, she gets a call from their new hire, Vikram.
Castle : And all hell breaks loose.
Alexis : Which means everything must be connected to Beckett's time in the AG.
Castle : But how? That was two years ago.
Alexis : - Maybe she stayed in contact. - And kept me in the dark?
Castle : Well, before today, I wouldn't have believed it.
Castle : Now, I can't help but wonder what else she's keeping from me.
Alexis : Don't go there, Dad.
Castle : Easier said than done.
UNK: Richard?
Castle : In here.
UNK: Ah, I thought you two might need a pick-me-up.
Martha : Oh, and look who I found downstairs.
UNK: Hey.
Castle : That's funny, last time I saw you, you said we were done.
Hayley : Look, I feel bad about what happened.
UNK: If I'd known I could have used you as bait,
UNK: I would've stuck around and followed your kidnappers.
UNK: Uh...
Hayley : It was a joke.
Martha : - Not a very good one. - Fair enough.
Castle : - What do you want, Hayley? - To help.
Hayley : I reckon that I owe you that much after what happened.
Alexis : She did give us the clue that found you.
Martha : Well, yeah, after Esposito dragged her down to the precinct.
UNK: Yeah, you're not wrong, Mother,
Castle : but we do need all the help we can get to find Beckett.
