UNK: Because of Bracken?
Castle : Why are you giving up on our marriage?
Beckett : I'm trying to save it.
Castle : By leaving me?
UNK: Look, ifyou have a problem, we have a problem.
Castle : That's how this works.
Beckett : No, Castle. Not this time.
Castle : Whatever it is, Beckett, we can figure it out.
Castle : Like always.
Beckett : Rick, do you trust me?
Rita : Of course.
Beckett : I need you to trust me now. I have to do this on my own.
UNK: And when it's done, I hope that...
UNK: I hope you'll have room in your heart to take me back.
Castle : You know, before Bracken was killed,
Castle : he told me you'd never be happy just being my wife.
UNK: Please do not tell me that son of a bitch knew you better than I do.
Beckett : I love you.
Beckett : I always will. Forgive me.
