UNK: AII bad things. But thou shalt not kill, remember?
Oscar : He isn't human, so it's not murder.
Castle : Good luck selling that in a court of law.
UNK: Enough!
Oscar : I have to stop the end of days.
Oscar : I promised my father.
UNK: Don't! Don't! No!
Oscar : What have you done?
Oscar : If I have to kill you first, I will.
Castle : Oscar, look out!
UNK: Castle!
Ryan : - Castle! where are you? - Over here!
Esposito : - Are you okay? - Yeah. You?
Beckett : - Yeah. - Good.
Esposito : - You okay? - Yeah, I'm still good. You?
Ryan : - Yeah, I'm okay. - Okay.
UNK: Now that we know you're all okay, can someone untie me?
Castle : Right. Sorry.
Crowne : We're lucky those pipes fell when they did, huh?
Castle : Yeah, lucky.
Crowne : Thank you for saving me.
Castle : Just to be clear, you really aren't the Antichrist, right?
UNK: Oh, I love your sense of humor.
Crowne : You saved my life, that means I owe you.
UNK: So, whatever you want, just ask, it's yours. Okay?
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Did I just literally make a deal with the Devil?
Ryan : So Oscar's on his way to Peakmore for a full psych evaluation.
Beckett : Okay. well, let's hope they can help him.
Esposito : I wouldn't hold my breath. They didn't do so great with Shaw.
Ryan : Hey, boss, what's your husband doing?
Beckett : Castle, this is getting out of hand.
UNK: I'm still marked for death.
UNK: Oh, well, you'd think that saving the Antichrist
UNK: would actually give you a pass.
Castle : You know, you mock. But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Beckett : - You're not going anywhere. - How can you be so sure?
UNK: Take offyourjacket.
Castle : - I really don't think this is the time... - Take offyourjacket.
Beckett : Okay, now take another selfie.
UNK: How...
Beckett : The zipper on your chest pocket.
Beckett : It was catching the light, causing a flare.
Castle : I'm not marked for death.
Beckett : You sound disappointed there.
Castle : Are you kidding? I'm thrilled. Let's celebrate. Naked Twister.
Beckett : Actually, I had something else in mind.
UNK: We really could've done movie night at my place.
Hayley : No, no, we need to get rid of some of the bad vibes in here.
Alexis : So what are we watching? Rom-com? Action comedy?
UNK: Horror.
Castle : - You're kidding. - No.
Hayley : Oh, come on. We just survived the axe-man.
UNK: A little Freddy-Jason action will be cathartic.
UNK: AII right. But if I can't sleep tonight, I'm kicking your ass in the morning.
Hayley : In your dreams.
UNK: Int - Richard Castle Investigations : - Hayley... - Hmm?
UNK: Run.
UNK: Yep.
Castle : That was genius.
Castle : Now can we play naked Twister?
