Lanie : I found that the wound had been inflicted by some kind oftalon or claw.
Ryan : Like an animal?
Lanie : It gets even weirder.
Lanie : There was a strange substance inside the wound.
UNK: Let me guess. Sulfur?
UNK: Yeah, how did you know?
Castle : Guys, isn't it obvious?
Castle : Latin prayers. A claw. Sulfur, also known as brimstone.
Esposito : Come on, Castle.
UNK: Captain, you don't think that...
Castle : Oh, but I do.
Castle : We all have our demons, but Gabriel was killed by his.
UNK: Whatdidl tellyou?
Beckett : I mean, as soon as the lights go out, bad things happen.
Beckett : You know, at least the precinct is on a backup generator
UNK: 'cause the rest of the city is gonna have intermittent power.
UNK: Today is gonna be hell.
UNK: Well, that's appropriate, since that's the likely place our killer is from.
UNK: You think we're gonna need specialized equipment
UNK: to capture this demon murderer?
Castle : Something exorcism-esque?
UNK: There is nothing supernatural about this case.
Castle : Our victim was stabbed with a brimstone-covered claw.
Castle : Or gored by a horn perhaps.
UNK: So what but a demon could do that?
Beckett : Look, Ryan and Espo are bringing in Dave Holmby, our rogue orderly.
UNK: And I'm sure that they are going to get a very sane and grounded explanation
