UNK: Finis omnium... I don't know.
UNK: Nunc est.
UNK: Finis omnium nunc est.
UNK: "The end is upon us."
Castle : I know why Shaw came here wielding an axe last night.
Hayley : To commit unholy murder on two unbelievably exceptional women?
Castle : Close, but no. He was trying to get in there.
Hayley : The safe?
Castle : This was all dry-walled over when I rented the office.
Castle : The contractors found it when I was doing the renovations.
UNK: The landlord thought it'd been removed,
Castle : but clearly, Noah Kramer walled it up before he died,
Castle : intent on burying whatever he and Shaw were working on.
Alexis : That's why Shaw grabbed the axe, to try and break into the safe.
Hayley : So what's inside?
Alexis : I don't know.
Hayley : Wait a minute. You've never opened... why the hell not?
UNK: Oh, God, is this another one of his...
UNK: - Mmm-hmm. - Great.
UNK: No, no. It's... Look...
Castle : If I opened it, I was bound to be disappointed
UNK: with whatever it was inside.
