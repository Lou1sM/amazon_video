UNK: and, uh, we found your garden claw.
UNK: Oh. So that explains that claw-shaped wound on Shaw's body.
Esposito : See, Castle? No demon.
Castle : Yeah? Then why was there sulfur, i.e., brimstone found in Shaw's body?
UNK: Our labs did an analysis of the murder weapon
Ryan : and not only did they find traces of Shaw's blood on it,
UNK: but they also found particles of sulfuric gardening fertilizer,
Ryan : which matches the sulfur we found in the wound.
Esposito : Anything else?
Sondra : I was just trying to talk some sense into him.
Sondra : But Shaw just started rambling
Sondra : about his mission to vanquish evil.
Sondra : He was the true evil.
