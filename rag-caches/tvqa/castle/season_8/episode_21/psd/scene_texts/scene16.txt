Castle : When an axe-wielding psychopath is killed by a demon trying to get inside,

Hayley : Chocolate milkshake.
Beckett : - Captain. - Yeah.
Esposito : According to Peakmore's visitors logs,
Esposito : the person who came to see Shaw was named Dennis wormwood.
Beckett : - Oh, good. Any luck finding him? - No, because it's a fake name.
Beckett : Okay. well, Peakmore must have security videos.
UNK: So pull the feed and see ifyou can ID him.

Beckett : Oh, that's strange.
UNK: "Creepy" is more like it.

UNK: - AII right, I'll keep digging. - Okay.
