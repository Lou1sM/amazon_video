Hayley : What kind of consultant?
UNK: Spiritual.
Alexis : Kramer had been hired to investigate the Crowne family.
Hayley : Wait. why would a PI hire a spiritual consultant
Hayley : to help investigate a billionaire philanthropist?
UNK: What? what is it?
Alexis : I know why Shaw came to this office.
Alexis : Twenty years ago, this was Noah Kramer's office.
Castle : Ooh, updating the murder board must mean Holmby's alibi checked out.
Ryan : - That it did. - Yes!
UNK: Really?
Castle : Come on, I'm just excited to get off the whole orderly thing
Castle : and onto the trail of the true killer,
Castle : which is most likely a road paved to hell,
Castle : because we all know that's where demons come from.
UNK: Well, I will be sure to cross-reference Shaw's visitor
UNK: against the list offallen angels, okay?
Castle : Has Esposito gotten the visitor logs yet?
Ryan : Well, he's trying, but the power outage is slowing everything down.
Ryan : Something wrong?
Castle : Look at that.
UNK: Yeah, it looks just like a lens flare. why?
Castle : There it is again.
UNK: Weird.
UNK: That's...
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Dad, Hayley andl didsome digging
UNK: and 20 years ago, Gabriel Shaw worked as a consultant
Alexis : for a PI named Noah Kramer who worked out ofyour office.
Castle : Then it's possible that Shaw came there with the axe,
UNK: Iooking for Kramer.
Hayley : Well, it's a nice theory, but Kramer's long dead.
Hayley : He was killed in an accident a year and a half
Hayley : after Shaw was committed to Peakmore.
Castle : What kind of an accident?
Alexis : He was impaled by a pipe that fell at a construction site.
Castle : Okay, that's horrible.
Castle : But, still, it's possible that Shaw was delusional enough
