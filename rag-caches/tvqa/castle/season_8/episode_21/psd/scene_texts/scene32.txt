UNK: Yo, that's Oscar Von Eckland's bracelet.
Castle : Why would he want the Angel Dagger?
Ryan : Because he was in on it the whole time.
Ryan : Do you remember the distorted image of Shaw's mystery visitor
Ryan : at the psychiatric facility?
Ryan : Well, Vikram was able to clean it up.
Esposito : He said he didn't believe in all this religious stuff.
Castle : He lied. And you all know what that means.
Alexis : That he's insane?
Castle : No, unlike Shaw, he has all his faculties.
Castle : But, Oscar, like his father before him, is a true believer.
UNK: He's gonna pick up where his old man left off.
Castle : - Complete the mission. - Kill the Antichrist.
UNK: Oscar is going to assassinate Victor Crowne!
Esposito : Yo, Rollins, lock down the building and secure Victor Crowne.
Rollins : - Whoa, whoa, whoa. what's going on? - Your boss is in danger.
Ryan : Have you seen this man?
Rollins : That's the notary who just showed up with legal documents
Rollins : for Mr. Crowne to sign.
Ryan : Did you give him access to Mr. Crowne?
Rollins : Yes, but not without an escort.
UNK: Varella, come in.
UNK: Varella, what's your 20?
Castle : - Where did they go? - Basement.
Rollins : We're about to start a major renovation.
Rollins : Mr. Crowne's down there alone, walking the site.
UNK: AII right, let's split up.
UNK: - You two go that way, we'll go this way. - Got it.
Esposito : - Somebody's down. - Yeah.
Ryan : He's still alive.
UNK: AII right, Castle, drag him upstairs to safety, all right?
UNK: - Yeah. wait, me? - Yeah.
Castle : - By myself? - Yes!
UNK: Okay.
