Beckett : Okay. well, let's hope they can help him.
Esposito : I wouldn't hold my breath. They didn't do so great with Shaw.
Ryan : Hey, boss, what's your husband doing?
Beckett : Castle, this is getting out of hand.
UNK: I'm still marked for death.
UNK: Oh, well, you'd think that saving the Antichrist
UNK: would actually give you a pass.
Castle : You know, you mock. But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Beckett : - You're not going anywhere. - How can you be so sure?
UNK: Take offyourjacket.
Castle : - I really don't think this is the time... - Take offyourjacket.
Beckett : Okay, now take another selfie.
UNK: How...
Beckett : The zipper on your chest pocket.
Beckett : It was catching the light, causing a flare.
Castle : I'm not marked for death.
Beckett : You sound disappointed there.
Castle : Are you kidding? I'm thrilled. Let's celebrate. Naked Twister.
Beckett : Actually, I had something else in mind.
UNK: We really could've done movie night at my place.
Hayley : No, no, we need to get rid of some of the bad vibes in here.
Alexis : So what are we watching? Rom-com? Action comedy?
UNK: Horror.
Castle : - You're kidding. - No.
Hayley : Oh, come on. We just survived the axe-man.
UNK: A little Freddy-Jason action will be cathartic.
UNK: AII right. But if I can't sleep tonight, I'm kicking your ass in the morning.
Hayley : In your dreams.
UNK: Int - Richard Castle Investigations : - Hayley... - Hmm?
UNK: Run.
UNK: Yep.
Castle : That was genius.
Castle : Now can we play naked Twister?
