UNK: None.
Martin : Gabriel's contact with the outside world was virtually nil.
Martin : His room's down here.
UNK: Any idea how he might've escaped?
UNK: Yes. He, uh, stole a key card from one of our orderlies.
Martin : Uh, we realized he was missing around noon today.
Ryan : Noon? why the hell didn't you call the police before?
Martin : We should have, I realize that now.
Castle : The man came to my office wielding an axe.
Martin : Which is why I sent out a group of orderlies looking for Gabriel.
UNK: And they searched all day and came back empty-handed.
Martin : - Except... - Except what?
Martin : One of the orderlies hasn't come back yet. Uh, Dave Holmby.
Martin : I tried calling him, but the phones are out.
Ryan : Have Dave and Gabriel had any problems in the past?
UNK: They've had issues, yes.
