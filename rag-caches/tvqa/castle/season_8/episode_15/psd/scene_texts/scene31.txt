Beckett : Come on.
Beckett : Don't move.
Beckett : You got it?
Beckett : So it was you, Malone?
UNK: Why?
Beckett : Why didn't you just turn Bardot over to IA?
Malone : I couldn't.
Malone : Not after what he found.
Beckett : Your office computer.
Beckett : He found something when he hacked into it.
Malone : Caught my hand in the cookie jar.
Malone : Forty years I protected this city.
Malone : And the thanks I got,
Malone : three busted marriages and a mountain of debt.
UNK: I took what I was owed.
Beckett : It doesn't have to end like this.
Malone : Actually, it does.
