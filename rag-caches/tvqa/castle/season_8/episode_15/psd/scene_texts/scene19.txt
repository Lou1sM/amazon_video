Ryan : One of the recruits went to college on a scholarship
Ryan : awarded by a trust created by Flanagan's law firm.
Ryan : Now, that scholarship was financed by Flanagan himself.
Beckett : So Flanagan has a second mole in the police academy? who?
UNK: I am not his mole, okay? Neither was Danny.
Beckett : We found the police files that he hacked and then handed over to Flanagan.
Decker : Oh, no.
Decker : No, no, no.
UNK: Danny must've made a deal in order to save me.
