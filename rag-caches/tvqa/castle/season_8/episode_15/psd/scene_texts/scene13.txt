Castle : I was trying to protect you.
Beckett : From who?
Castle : From yourself.
Esposito : Hey, Captain.
UNK: Uh, we found something you need to see.
Beckett : I'll be right there.
Beckett : I need time to process this.
Beckett : What is it?
UNK: Well, we found street-cam footage of Bardot before he was killed.
Ryan : This is Bardot an hour before he was murdered.
Ryan : Walking past the fish market, which is right across the alley
Ryan : from a lingerie wholesaler.
Ryan : It's a known front for Jack Flanagan,
UNK: aka "Lucky Jack."
Ryan : He's the Mafia boss who runs Hunts Point.
Beckett : Bardot grew up in Hunts Point.
Esposito : Check this out.
Esposito : The law firm that Bardot contacted,
Esposito : they represent Jack Flanagan.
Ryan : Bardot was communicating to Flanagan
Ryan : through a third party so it couldn't be traced.
Esposito : And it gets better. Show her.
Ryan : Our victim was in league with the Irish Mafia.
UNK: Flanagan must've planted Bardot in the NYPD as his mole.
Beckett : For all we know, he's been grooming Bardot
Beckett : since he was a kid in the old neighborhood.
UNK: But what I don't get is if Bardot was working for Flanagan,
