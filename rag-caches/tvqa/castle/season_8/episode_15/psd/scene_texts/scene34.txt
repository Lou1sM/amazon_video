Beckett : This is our fight now.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Okay, then there's something you should know.
UNK: That mystery bullet wound I got when I disappeared?
Castle : I was shot in Los Angeles.
Castle : Two hours before I took that bullet,
Castle : LokSat came to town, arriving by plane.
Beckett : Uh... Okay. There are three major airports,
Beckett : along with dozens of private ones in the Los Angeles area.
Beckett : We're talking tens of thousands of people.
Beckett : But maybe Vikram can whittle that number down.
Castle : We're looking for a needle in a stack of needles.
Castle : But LokSat is one of those needles.
Castle : What do you say, Beckett?
Castle : It's a place to start.
Beckett : No. This is.
