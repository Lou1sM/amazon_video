Castle : I'm not making any more decisions concerning LokSat without Beckett.
Hayley : Now, that is the smartest thing I've heard all day.
UNK: Oh, so sorry. Okay, I'll get more aspirin.
Beckett : You are not quitting.
Decker : I'm unfit to be a cop, Captain.
UNK: Ifyou hadn't talked me down back there...
Decker : I had every intention of pulling that trigger.
Beckett : But you didn't.
Beckett : You regained your wits.
Beckett : You made the right decision, and that's what counts.
Beckett : There was a point in my career where I wanted to quit.
Beckett : I lost faith that I became a cop for the right reason.
UNK: How'd you get your faith back?
Beckett : A man named Roy Montgomery helped me. He was my captain.
