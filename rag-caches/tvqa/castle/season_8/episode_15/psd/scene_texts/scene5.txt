Beckett : Your own personal style.
Beckett : Now, some people Iike good cop/bad cop.
Beckett : Others like bad cop/worse cop.
Beckett : But choosing just one method is a mistake.
Beckett : Every suspect is different.
Beckett : And sometimes you don't know how you're gonna go at them
Beckett : until they start talking.
Beckett : Because you only get one shot in interrogation.
Beckett : And if you screw it up, a killer might walk free.
Beckett : So I want to try something.
Beckett : I need a volunteer.
Beckett : Yeah. Lopez.
Beckett : Right over here.
UNK: Ms. Lopez, thank you for coming in.
Lopez : Anything I can do to help the NYPD.
Beckett : So, a crime was committed last night and your name was mentioned.
UNK: I was wondering ifyou could tell me where you were.
Lopez : Sure. I went to the fights over at Harry's Gym.
UNK: Mmm-hmm. You go alone?
UNK: No. Takata, Chambers, Decker, we all went.
UNK: Did you have anything to drink?
Lopez : Yeah. we had a few drinks.
Beckett : - How many? - I don't remember.
Lopez : What's in the bag?
Beckett : - Why? - I don't know.
Lopez : You put it on the table, must mean something.
Beckett : Decker, take her place.
UNK: Was Ms. Lopez telling the truth? Were you out last night?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : And were the four of you out together all night?
Beckett : Don't look at them. Look at me.
Beckett : Were the four of you together all night watching the fight?
UNK: No. Uh, Lopez and Takata left early.
Decker : Chambers was still there when I left, which was right before the last fight.
