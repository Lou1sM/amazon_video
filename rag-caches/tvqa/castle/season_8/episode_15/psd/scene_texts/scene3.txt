Castle : So, the victim, Bardot, stumbled onto a dirty cop.
Ryan : Well, that would explain the threatening note,
UNK: "Dead men tell no tales."
Castle : But Bardot wouldn't back down, so the cop kills him.
UNK: What was the name of the trainer that was dealing?
UNK: Arthur Stinson. Today is not your lucky day.
Esposito : It's actually the complete opposite ofyour lucky day.
UNK: Arthur Stenson : Look, man, I don't know what people have been telling you,
UNK: Arthur Stenson : but I don't sell drugs.
UNK: Oh, really? 'Cause that's exactly what they've been telling us.
Esposito : And the stash that we found hidden
UNK: in the false bottom ofyour locker confirms it.
Ryan : So here's the deal.
Ryan : We say nice things about you to the DA,
Ryan : maybe get you a suspended sentence,
UNK: ifyou give up that cop you've been dealing to at the Academy.
