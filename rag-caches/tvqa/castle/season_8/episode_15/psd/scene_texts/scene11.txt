Ryan : Chinatown, across the street from the back-alley computer repair shop
Ryan : where Bardot was dropped
Ryan : with five grand burning a hole in his pocket.
Beckett : What was he doing there?
Ryan : Owner refused to talk when I showed her his photo.
Ryan : So I looked into her.
Ryan : Word is she deals in black market
Ryan : software and hardware.
Ryan : Bardot may have bought something from her.
Beckett : I wonder why.
Beckett : Let's get Bardot's laptop to Vikram, have him run a deeper search.
UNK: AII right.
Esposito : Yo, Decker's tip on Bardot's shoes paid off.
Esposito : The lab identified wild Scottish salmon scales on the soles.
Esposito : And only three fish markets import wild Scottish salmon.
Beckett : That's the same neighborhood as the crime scene.
UNK: And apparently, Bardot went there on consecutive nights.
Esposito : We'll canvass the fish market,
UNK: see ifwe can figure out what he was up to.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : You were right.
Castle : I uncovered the real reason I had my memories erased.
Castle : And it's bad.
