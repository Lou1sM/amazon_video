UNK: But I can't.
Ryan : Well, I guess we're done here, then. Say hi to the jury for us.
Arthur : I can't because we've never met.
UNK: AII right, look.
UNK: The cop puts cash in a locker. I pick it up, I leave the drugs. That's it.
UNK: So how do you know that you're dealing to a police officer?
Arthur : The buyer only arranges pickups on Police Appreciation Nights.
Arthur : The NYPD doesn't pay a cover, the gym's crawling with cops.
Ryan : How does the buyer contact you?
Arthur : They shove an index card in my locker.
Arthur : Note says when they want delivery.
Ryan : Hold on, a blue index card?
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : I think I know how Beckett can smoke out our killer.
Beckett : The thing about interviewing a suspect is you have to find what works for you.
