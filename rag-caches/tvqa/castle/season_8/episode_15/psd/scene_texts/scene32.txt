UNK: I'm gonna draw him away.
Beckett : Just give up, Malone. My detectives are onto you.
UNK: No.
Malone : They're onto Ortiz.
Ryan : Damn it.
Beckett : So what are you going to do, Malone?
Beckett : Kill me and stage it like Ortiz did it?
Beckett : Say you shot him in self-defense?
Malone : Good plan, huh?
UNK: Probably give me a medal.
UNK: Peekaboo.
UNK: Sarge,
UNK: I thought we finally got rid ofyou.
UNK: Oh, it's gonna take more than a bullet to put me down for the long dirt nap.
Esposito : Well, you best heal up quick.
Esposito : Got a new batch of recruits coming in a few weeks.
UNK: AII right, Sarge, we'll get you out of here. Medic.
Beckett : - Thanks. - Yeah.
Beckett : Hey, how're you holding up?
Decker : We caught Danny's killer, but Lucky Jack Flanagan's still free.
Beckett : Yeah, well, his time will come.
Beckett : Stay with the NYPD, and you can help with that.
UNK: But you can't do this ifyou go it alone.
UNK: Do you wanna be a cop or not?
UNK: Yes.
