Decker : Look, the truth is, Danny was hiding something from me.
UNK: He had been going out at night the last few nights,
Decker : which was really unlike him.
Decker : He'd slip into my room late, said he'd been out for a midnightjog.
Decker : But, I mean, I knew that was total BS
Decker : because when he came in, he wasn't tired, he wasn't sweaty.
Decker : Just always smelled like rotten fish.
Castle : - Really? - Yeah, it was weird.
Decker : I asked him about it.
UNK: He said he accidentally stepped in garbage on his run.
UNK: But ifthat was the case, then...
Beckett : Then why did he smell Iike rotten fish every night?
