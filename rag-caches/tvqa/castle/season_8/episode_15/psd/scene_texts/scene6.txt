Beckett : Do you know what a PED is?
UNK: Yeah. It's a performance-enhancing drug.
Beckett : Chambers, take Decker's place.
UNK: Chambers. Chambers!
Esposito : Where are you running to, recruit?
Ryan : You don't want to miss the rest of the Captain's lecture, do you?
Ryan : Turn over.
Beckett : - Ready to earn some extra credit? - I want a lawyer.
Beckett : Yeah, well, you better get a good one.
Beckett : Juries don't like cop killers.
Chambers : Wait, you think I popped Bardot?
Beckett : We found a stack of identical cards in your dorm room desk.
UNK: Lawyer.
Beckett : You sent that to Bardot because
UNK: he found out that you were dealing drugs.
Chambers : - Lawyer! - Fine.
Beckett : You want in on a bet?
Chambers : - On what? - On you.
Beckett : You're not cooperating, so I'm taking protective custody off the table.
Beckett : And a bunch of us are wagering on how long you're gonna last
Beckett : once the inmates find out that you're a cop.
UNK: I'm guessing under 12 hours.
UNK: And I'm feeling real lucky right now.
UNK: Wait.
Chambers : - Can I make a deal? - Depends.
Beckett : Start talking.
