UNK: Uh-oh. what?
UNK: They're onto us. Vikram's trying to track our IP address.
Castle : Can you stop him?
Hayley : No. But I can slow him down.
Vikram : It's coming from inside the city.
Vikram : - Trying to narrow it down. - Okay.
Beckett : What the hell?
Vikram : Oh, you are good.
Vikram : But I am better.
Beckett : Cat videos? That doesn't seem like LokSat.
Beckett : Who would do that?
Vikram : We're about to find out.
Hayley : That barely slowed him down.
UNK: I'm sorry, but he's gonna find us in less than a minute.
Hayley : Should we abort?
Castle : No. we've only got two of the blinky boxes left to go.
Castle : Blinky boxes.
Castle : Just hack, hack.
UNK: Come on. Got it.
Beckett : That's Castle's office.
Vikram : He must be working with Hayley. She's got the skill set for this.
UNK: And she is about to breach our firewall.
Vikram : If she does, they'll have instant access to our entire investigation.
UNK: No, no, no, no. That's gonna put a target on Castle's back.
Beckett : We have to stop him.
Vikram : I can do it, but I need time.
Beckett : Let me see if I can buy you some.
Castle : It's Beckett calling. Beckett, she's... what do I do?
Vikram : Answer it.
Hayley : Let's see how much she knows.
Alexis : - Hey. - Hey, babe.
Castle : Change your mind about tonight?
Castle : Uh, you know, uh, tonight's still not gonna work.
Beckett : But what about right now?
Beckett : Feel like steaming up your office?
UNK: My office? That sounds great.
James : I'm, uh...
UNK: I'm sort of in the middle of something right now.
Beckett : Really? That's too bad. 'Cause I'm right downstairs.
UNK: "Downstairs" downstairs?
UNK: Yeah. I can be up in 10 seconds.
UNK: Ten seconds is not long at all.
Castle : Hang on one second.
UNK: We got to shut it down. She's gonna walk in the front door.
Hayley : No. She's lying. Her phone is pinging from Queens.
UNK: She knows it's us who's hacking her.
Castle : Sorry about that. Just taking off my pants. You coming up?
Beckett : He knows I'm lying.
Ryan : Hey. Uh... You know what, something just came up.
Beckett : Rain check?
Castle : Sure. You know where to find me.
UNK: Okay.
Vikram : She's almost in.
UNK: I can launch a cyber-nuke, but it'll completely fry his system.
Beckett : He's got a back-up system at home.
Vikram : Is that a go for launch?
UNK: Yes.
Hayley : No, no, no! Oh!
UNK: What just happened?
Hayley : Armageddon, I'm afraid.
Hayley : Vikram just nuked the whole system. We've lost everything.
UNK: We've...
Castle : I never liked that guy.
Beckett : Did they get in?
Vikram : No. Another second and they would have.
Vikram : Thankfully our location and all our files are still safe.
Beckett : Yeah. For now. I just hope I didn't nuke my marriage.
UNK: - Where you going? - I need to talk to Castle.
Vikram : No. That'll have to wait.
UNK: I found the garbage truck driver from Friendly Islands.
UNK: His shift ends in 30 minutes.
Vikram : With Lara's murder all over the news,
Vikram : they might be circling their wagons.
UNK: We gotta get to him now.
Beckett : No, I hate lying to him.
Castle : I know. But you're doing it for the right reasons.
UNK: And this is our first real shot to get to LokSat. we have to take it.
Beckett : You're right.
Beckett : Tell me about the driver.
UNK: His name is Sam Mackey.
UNK: Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't hurt me. Please. who are you?
UNK: We're the people that show when you screw up a delivery.
