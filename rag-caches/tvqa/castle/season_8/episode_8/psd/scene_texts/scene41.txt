Castle : The fact that you even think that breaks my heart.
Castle : I'd walk into a tornado for you, Kate.
Beckett : And I would die if I lost you.
UNK: You wanna know what hurts the most?
UNK: You could've come to me with everything,
Castle : broken us up, just like you did.
Castle : Only it would have been a cover.
Castle : And together, in secret, we could have taken this guy down.
UNK: Only that thought never even occurred to you.
Castle : Because deep down inside,
Castle : you like being broken
Castle : and you need this obsession.
Castle : And no matter what I do, I can't change that.
Castle : Only you can, Kate.
Esposito : Hey, uniforms just spotted Acosta's partner going into his building.
UNK: We were gonna go roust him.
Esposito : But we can roll without you.
Castle : No, actually, I was just leaving.
Beckett : Wait, no, Castle.
Castle : You have a job to do.
Castle : And there's no one better.
UNK: Officer Ellroy : Longarzo came in about 40 minutes ago.
Beckett : - Anybody with him? - No.
UNK: Officer Ellroy : He's alone. And there's no one else in the apartment as far as I can tell.
UNK: AII right, we'll take it from here, thank you.
UNK: Ifthis guy really is cartel,
Ryan : he might have an arsenal up in that apartment.
Ryan : Should we call ESU?
UNK: NYPD!
UNK: Hey, stop! Get down.
UNK: Gun!
UNK: No!
Castle : You okay?
UNK: No.
Ryan : Acosta's partner could have brought us closer to LokSat.
Beckett : Instead, he's in the morgue.
Beckett : It's all come crashing down around my ears,
Beckett : and I've got nobody to blame but myself.
Vikram : Ah, you are having a pity party. That's okay. I'll leave.
Vikram : But I will be taking a prettyjuicy clue with me.
UNK: Ifyou're messing with me, I might shoot you.
Vikram : Does that mean you want to hear what I got?
Beckett : - Yeah. - Okay.
