UNK: Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't hurt me. Please. who are you?
UNK: We're the people that show when you screw up a delivery.
Sam : No, I took it straight to the warehouse just like I was told.
Vikram : Don't lie to us. we were watching. You didn't follow instructions.
Sam : Yes, I did. I went straight to the place in the Bronx.
UNK: By the Third Avenue Bridge.
Sam : Just like the guy from Panama said.
Beckett : Did you see anything?
UNK: No. No, I stayed in the truck Iike I was told.
Vikram : Who's the guy in Panama?
Beckett : I don't know.
Beckett : I know what you're thinking, Sam.
UNK: You're thinking I'm not gonna kill you,
Beckett : and you are right.
Beckett : But you've been running drugs,
Beckett : and that means the NYPD can seize everything in your life.
UNK: You want your kids to Iive out of a cardboard box?
UNK: 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
Sam : I don't know any names.
UNK: They pay me not to ask questions.
Sam : Don't involve my family. I didn't have a choice.
Vikram : I think he's telling the truth.
UNK: AII right, Sam, here's what's gonna happen.
Beckett : I'm not going to arrest you.
UNK: But ifyou get another delivery, you call this number.
Sam : No, no, no. I can't. They'll kill me.
Vikram : They might. But if I arrest you, they definitely will.
UNK: And telling them about this conversation
Vikram : guarantees that your whole family will be wiped out.
Sam : I won't say a word.
Castle : - I promise. - Good.
Beckett : Now where exactly is the warehouse
Beckett : full of heroin?
Vikram : We're too late. They already moved the heroin.
UNK: And there're no street cams outside so we could see who picked it up.
UNK: Ugh. Damn it. This was for nothing.
Vikram : No, no, we do have something.
Vikram : We find out who the main players are at Friendly Island Sanitation,
Vikram : and the next time Sam catches the shipment, we'll be there.
UNK: It's Ryan. Hey.
UNK: Okay, yeah, I'll be right there.
