UNK: She knows it's us who's hacking her.
Castle : Sorry about that. Just taking off my pants. You coming up?
Beckett : He knows I'm lying.
Ryan : Hey. Uh... You know what, something just came up.
Beckett : Rain check?
Castle : Sure. You know where to find me.
UNK: Okay.
Vikram : She's almost in.
UNK: I can launch a cyber-nuke, but it'll completely fry his system.
Beckett : He's got a back-up system at home.
Vikram : Is that a go for launch?
UNK: Yes.
Hayley : No, no, no! Oh!
UNK: What just happened?
Hayley : Armageddon, I'm afraid.
Hayley : Vikram just nuked the whole system. We've lost everything.
UNK: We've...
Castle : I never liked that guy.
Beckett : Did they get in?
Vikram : No. Another second and they would have.
Vikram : Thankfully our location and all our files are still safe.
Beckett : Yeah. For now. I just hope I didn't nuke my marriage.
