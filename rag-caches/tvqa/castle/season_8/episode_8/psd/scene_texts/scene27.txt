Ryan : Now we finally have the evidence to prove it.

Esposito : I'll get in touch with the cell provider to see
UNK: ifwe can ping that burner phone so I can locate it.
Beckett : And take apart Acosta's life.
Beckett : Let's check known associates,
UNK: anything that will point us to who his partner was.
UNK: I found out who sent Kate that mystery text last night. It was Vikram.
Castle : Wait, Vikram? Our Vikram?
Hayley : Oh, yes.
Castle : What's this?
Hayley : Oh, it's a secret messaging program between Kate and Vikram's cell phones.
Hayley : It routes through proxy servers into an encrypted central server.
UNK: State-of-the-art spycraft.
Castle : But why? what are they up to?
Martha : I could ask the same thing of the two ofyou.
