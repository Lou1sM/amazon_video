UNK: No, no, no, no. That's gonna put a target on Castle's back.
Beckett : We have to stop him.
Vikram : I can do it, but I need time.
Beckett : Let me see if I can buy you some.
Castle : It's Beckett calling. Beckett, she's... what do I do?
Vikram : Answer it.
Hayley : Let's see how much she knows.
Alexis : - Hey. - Hey, babe.
Castle : Change your mind about tonight?
Castle : Uh, you know, uh, tonight's still not gonna work.
Beckett : But what about right now?
Beckett : Feel like steaming up your office?
UNK: My office? That sounds great.
James : I'm, uh...
UNK: I'm sort of in the middle of something right now.
Beckett : Really? That's too bad. 'Cause I'm right downstairs.
UNK: "Downstairs" downstairs?
UNK: Yeah. I can be up in 10 seconds.
UNK: Ten seconds is not long at all.
Castle : Hang on one second.
UNK: We got to shut it down. She's gonna walk in the front door.
Hayley : No. She's lying. Her phone is pinging from Queens.
