Beckett : Castle, why couldn't you just trust me?
Castle : How can you ask me that?
Castle : I saw the text Vikram sent you last night.
Castle : I thought you were in trouble.
Castle : Instead, I find out you've been lying to me.
Beckett : I was trying to protect you.
Castle : From Allison Hyde's killer?

UNK: you weren'tjust looking for "me time."
