UNK: but something is going on with Beckett, and I'm worried about her.
Castle : I know.
UNK: Okay, you go do what you need to do. I'll see what I can find out.
Castle : Okay. Oh, uh...
Castle : You know, Hayley, I set up the small office
Castle : on the other side of reception especially for you.
UNK: Aw! I'm good here.
Castle : But this is my office.
Hayley : Of course it is.
Hayley : I shall call you if I find anything out.
Hayley : Have a good day.
UNK: Uh, Vikram?
UNK: Surprise!
UNK: Vikram Singh : Welcome to our new office.
Beckett : A strip club? Really?
Vikram : Hey, you said to find a location where we could hunt
Vikram : for LokSat without anyone Iooking over our shoulders.
Beckett : Yeah. And, uh, this is the best you could find?
UNK: It's perfect. Vice raided the place, now it's tied up in trial.
Vikram : We can operate here for months completely off the grid.
Vikram : Plus, I can work out my core.
Beckett : So, the text from last night,
Beckett : what did you find?
Vikram : Actually, uh,
UNK: that's a dead end.
UNK: What?
Vikram : My bad.
Beckett : And you didn't know this last night?
UNK: Um...
Beckett : Did you text me to pull me out of my anniversary dinner with Castle?
Vikram : Look, you broke up with him for a reason.
