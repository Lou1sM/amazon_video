UNK: Acosta?
Beckett : We need to talk.
Beckett : Don't move. You're under arrest for the murder of Lara Madden.
Castle : So he wants an attorney.
Beckett : Public Defender's Office is sending someone over now.
UNK: Yo, this guy is dirty as hell.
Esposito : He's connected to the Los Zetas drug cartel.
Beckett : Well, look what we found on him.
Castle : He circled his prey.
Castle : This is Richard Castle.
Hayley : I take it that you're not alone.
Castle : No, not at all.
UNK: You should probably make it back here. I found something.
UNK: AII right, I'll see you soon.
UNK: Sorry, guys, I've got to take off.
Beckett : Hey, uh, Rick?
Beckett : Thanks for today.
UNK: It's my pleasure.
Vikram : Hey, Beckett,
UNK: - you got a second? - Uh, yeah.
Vikram : I watched the rest of the footage from Lara's camera.
Vikram : What I saw was disgusting and criminal,
Vikram : - but it had nothing to do with drugs. - Uh...
Vikram : She was filming cruise ship workers illegally dumping trash out at sea.
Beckett : So that's why she was on the Operations deck of the ship.
Beckett : She was making a documentary film.
Vikram : Poor thing was trying to be a one-woman Greenpeace.
Beckett : But she must have stumbled on a drug smuggling conspiracy,
Beckett : moving heroin through the cruise line's trash.
Beckett : That's brilliant.
Beckett : Nobody looks into the trash moving in and out of ports.
