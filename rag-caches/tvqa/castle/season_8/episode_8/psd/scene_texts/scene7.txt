Castle : I mean, I know it's a fixer upper.
Beckett : I don't know, maybe for our second anniversary.
Castle : Oh, I don't know if anything's gonna compare to the first.
Beckett : Um, you know, you really shouldn't be here.
Castle : Why not?
Beckett : Are we moving?
Castle : Beckett, I think your crime scene's making a run for it.
Beckett : Captain, you need to stop this ship.
UNK: That's not gonna happen.
Castle : Captain, we're investigating the murder of one ofyour ship's dancers.
UNK: Captain Ziering : I'm under orders from headquarters to get underway.
UNK: Are you telling me Iconic Cruise Lines is trying to cover up a murder?
UNK: I am telling you the company is near bankruptcy.
UNK: Captain Ziering : They can't afford the bad press.
Beckett : Stop this ship, or I will charge you with obstruction.
Beckett : I can call the Coast Guard to interdict this vessel.
UNK: Captain Ziering : Sure you can.
UNK: Captain Ziering : But you know as well as I do that by the time you activate them,
UNK: Captain Ziering : we'll be in international waters.
UNK: Where U.S. Iaws don't apply. That's what Iconic is counting on.
UNK: And just so the two ofyou know,
UNK: Captain Ziering : they're sending a boat to pick you up in about an hour.
UNK: So we got 60 minutes to investigate this murder
Castle : before we lose access to our crime scene.
UNK: Captain Ziering : - And about that. - Really?
UNK: Captain Ziering : I've been instructed to order the crew not to cooperate with you.
UNK: Hey, I'm not losing myjob over this.
UNK: We gotta divide and conquer.
Castle : Right. I'll talk to Lara's dancer friends.
Castle : They may be the last ones to see her alive.
UNK: Okay, butjust remember, they're not supposed to cooperate,
