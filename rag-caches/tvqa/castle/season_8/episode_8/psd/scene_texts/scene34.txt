UNK: Uh-oh. what?
UNK: They're onto us. Vikram's trying to track our IP address.
Castle : Can you stop him?
Hayley : No. But I can slow him down.
Vikram : It's coming from inside the city.
Vikram : - Trying to narrow it down. - Okay.
Beckett : What the hell?
Vikram : Oh, you are good.
Vikram : But I am better.
Beckett : Cat videos? That doesn't seem like LokSat.
Beckett : Who would do that?
Vikram : We're about to find out.
Hayley : That barely slowed him down.
UNK: I'm sorry, but he's gonna find us in less than a minute.
