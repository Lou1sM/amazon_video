UNK: Sniper!
Beckett : Are you okay?
UNK: I think so. I think so.
Beckett : Somebody call an ambulance!
UNK: Sergei.
Ryan : Bullet went through and through.
Ryan : Sergei's in surgery right now. He is expected to make a full recovery.
Ryan : Anything on the shooter?
Esposito : Yeah, we found the sniper's nest
Esposito : in the building across the street from the Consulate.
Ryan : Any luck with security video?
Esposito : Disabled, but we found a janitor's uniform and the sniper's weapon.
UNK: It's a Russian-made Dragunov.
Ryan : Did CSU pull prints or DNA?
UNK: They're trying, but I doubt they are gonna find anything.
Esposito : Whoever pulled this off is a pro.
Ryan : Which means IDing our shooter, who most likely killed Grigory
Ryan : when he found out about this whole assassination plot,
UNK: is gonna be damn near impossible.
Beckett : And it only gets worse.
Beckett : The Russians are claiming that we created a distraction
Beckett : for their security team,
Beckett : which allowed for the assassination attempt on their Consul General.
