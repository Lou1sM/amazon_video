UNK: Hold up, you save the Consul's ass, and this is the thanks we get?
Beckett : Plus, they're refusing any further cooperation with us
Beckett : on Grigory's murder investigation.
Ryan : - Why would they do that? - I don't...
Vasiliy : Because we're scared.
Vasiliy : It is easier to blame America for our troubles,
Vasiliy : when the truth is, we're fighting ourselves.
UNK: - Is this supposed to be an apology? - It didn't sound like one.
Vasiliy : The attempt on Oborin's life
Vasiliy : has shaken everyone in the Russian diplomatic community.
Vasiliy : No one knows who to trust.
Vasiliy : And what little faith Oborin has in me is now lost.
Beckett : So now that you're all out of friends, you've come to us for help.
