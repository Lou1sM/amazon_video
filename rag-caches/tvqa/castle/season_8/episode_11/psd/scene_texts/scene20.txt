Beckett : Frank, aka Anatoly, is the key to figuring out
Beckett : what's behind these murders.
Beckett : So you guys dig into his life and see what you can find.
UNK: What do want us to do about Vasily?
Beckett : We gotta keep him as far away from this case as possible.
UNK: Which means we need to launch Operation Nickel Tour.
UNK: AII right.
Castle : - What's that? - You're gonna take him sightseeing.
Beckett : See what he knows.
Beckett : In the meantime, I'm gonna talk to the feds
UNK: and see ifthey have any intel on Anatoly returning to active status.
Beckett : Hello, I need my curtains cleaned.
UNK: Vasily.
UNK: Is the baby party emergency resolved?
UNK: Oh, yeah, yeah. And good news,
Castle : the boys have hours and hours of research to do, phone calls for the case.
Castle : So I thought why not take this chance
Castle : to show you around this little island we call home.
Vasiliy : It is not a critical juncture? I don't want to be a shirker.
