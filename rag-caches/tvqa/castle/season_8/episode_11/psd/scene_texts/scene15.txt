Beckett : Mr. Mishkin, was there anything in your son or late wife's behavior
Beckett : that would merit suspicion?
Sergei : If there was, I would have told our security agents.
Castle : What was your wife doing upstate?
UNK: Uh...
Sergei : I believe she was having an affair.
UNK: - Uh, with whom? - I don't know.
UNK: We had grown apart, but we both wanted to serve at this post.
