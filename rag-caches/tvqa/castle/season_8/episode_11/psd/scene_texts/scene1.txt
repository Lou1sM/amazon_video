Castle : - Every day. - Well...
Castle : - Sometimes twice. - What?
UNK: I said, "This is nice." Thank you so much for doing that.
Alexis : - Yeah, no problem. - Bye.
UNK: Morning. BECKETT : Hey.
Ryan : So, our vic is a Russian national, name of...
Beckett : Grigory Mishkin. I spoke to the police commissioner.
Beckett : He's the son of a Consulate Officer, which means this might get political.
Ryan : Oh, great.
UNK: Hey, Lanie. So, what do we got?
UNK: Lanie Parish : Throat was slashed.
UNK: Liver temp puts time of death between 2 : 00 and 4 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : Any idea what our victim was doing
Beckett : in an abandoned building in the middle of the night?
Ryan : No, his pockets were turned out,
Ryan : but his wallet and his cell phone were found nearby.
Ryan : So, the killer searched him,
Ryan : but there's no way to know if anything was taken.
Beckett : Lanie, what do you make of these?
Lanie : Looks like ink that was transferred from whatever was in his shirt.
Beckett : See if the lab can reconstruct the characters.
Beckett : He might have been killed because of whatever was inside.
Alexis : - Yeah. - Thanks.
UNK: Howdy.
UNK: "Howdy"?
UNK: Yeah. "Yo" was getting played out, so I thought I'd try something new.
Beckett : You might want to keep trying, 'cause "howdy" is just...
UNK: wrong.
Esposito : Well, I like it.
Esposito : Oh, by the way, there's a homeless guy
Esposito : that was camped out down the block.
Esposito : He heard a car roar to life, burn rubber around 2 : 30 a.m.
UNK: So, I'm pulling the street-cam footage.
UNK: AII right, keep me posted.
UNK: I'm gonna head off to Russia and talk to next of kin.
Ryan : - Russia? - What?
UNK: Oh, legally, a consulate is considered foreign territory, so...
UNK: Ah...
UNK: AII right. See you later.
UNK: I'm Consul General Pavel Oborin.
Beckett : Captain Kate Beckett, NYPD. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Oborin.
