UNK: who is Nikki Heat's new nemesis.
UNK: Enemy from the East, a new Cold war.
Vasiliy : Cold war, yes.
Vasiliy : But though Heat and Ice are rivals,
Vasiliy : their sexual attraction is like nuclear fire.
UNK: Vasily, I have to admit you are not at all what I expected.
UNK: You thought I'll be like Red Heat?
Alexis : - Yeah. - That is old Russia. I am new Russia.
Castle : Isn't that our suspect?
Vasiliy : What a coincidence.
Vasiliy : Your detective friends didn't have much luck questioning him.
UNK: - I wonder ifwe can do better. - Oh...
Castle : Maybe we should leave it... Maybe we shouldn't interfere.
UNK: Hello.
Jurgen : Who are you?
Vasiliy : Pick up book, young man.
Vasiliy : This here is Richard Castle, one of the great mystery writers of our time.
