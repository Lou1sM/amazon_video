UNK: But why? what does he want from us?
Castle : Is that another clue?
UNK: Last piece of the puzzle.
UNK: "Ofthose who remain, only your better half can survive."
Judah : what the hell does that mean?
Beckett : There are six of us left and three levers.
Beckett : He wants to separate the couples. Make us choose who goes free.
Patty : And who stays behind to pull the levers.
Patty : I assume all three need to be pulled at once to open the door.
Castle : Unless that's what he wants us to think.
Castle : These levers could just as easily blow this room.
Judah : How are we supposed to know?
Todd : We have to have faith.
Castle : Wait! wait!
Todd : See? Faith.
Todd : Now, who's staying in here with me?
UNK: Swat Member : State Police!
UNK: We got two hostages.
Esposito : It's the Northcliffs!
UNK: - Bedroom, clear. - Kitchen, clear.
Esposito : What the hell is this?
UNK: Dad?
Alexis : Where are they?
UNK: Jeffrey Northcliff : There's a building hidden in the trees at the bottom of the hill.
Esposito : Who's behind this? who left you here?
UNK: Samantha Northcliff : Our son, Brandon.
UNK: We're out oftime.
UNK: You need to choose which ones ofyou are staying in here with me.
Castle : - I'll stay. - Castle.
Beckett : Fine. But I'm not letting you stay here alone.
UNK: Patricia, you leave with the others.
UNK: The instructions say "your better half."
UNK: Ifyou both stay, that's breaking the rules.
Beckett : Screw the rules!
Todd : There could be consequences for all of us.
UNK: There's consequences when we follow the rules, too.
Judah : Come on.
Patty : Thank you. we'll send help.
Castle : So, what now?
Castle : I'm sorry. I thought we could run out the door.
UNK: Really? So it's not because we broke your rules?
UNK: Well, he did say that there'd be consequences.
Castle : We know it's you.
UNK: Damn it.
UNK: Don't.
Todd : What gave me away?
