Judah : How? That door's the only way out.
UNK: Ifwe can find something we can use as a pry bar,
UNK: we can get it between the lock and the frame, we might be able to pop it open.
UNK: Yeah, okay. AII right.
Beckett : So, the chemicals in there are explosive.
UNK: Itjust needs a catalyst to set it off.
UNK: Great.
UNK: Fuse.
Patty : Here you go.
UNK: Thanks. Perfect.
UNK: I've always loved the smell of this stuff.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : You two better hide.
Judah : What was that?
Jennifer : I don't know, but we need to get out of here now.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : Just stay close.
Beckett : This could be another trap.
Beckett : Get back.
Beckett : There's someone there. Stay close, okay?
Castle : Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't shoot. It's rigged to kill the shooter.
Castle : That's how Simon died.
Castle : - Thank God you're okay. - Patricia...
Beckett : - You okay? - Yeah, good.
Todd : - We should keep moving. - He's right.
Castle : - It could be a trap! - No! wait, wait!
Todd : It's fine! we can get out.
UNK: Let's go. Let's get out of here!
Judah : About damn time.
Todd : Oh, we're free!
UNK: No!
UNK: Damn it!
Castle : - No! - We're locked in.
MEADOw : No.
UNK: Whatever they're for, we got less than five minutes to figure it out.
UNK: It started counting down as soon as the doors closed.
Beckett : Okay. Clearly, this room is our captor's endgame.
Beckett : He wanted us to end up here.
