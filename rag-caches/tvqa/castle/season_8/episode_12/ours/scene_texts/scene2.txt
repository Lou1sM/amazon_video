Simon : - what is that thing? - It's a cryptex.
Castle : It's kind of a lockbox that requires a password to open it.
Castle : So we just need the password.
Judah : We need to bust out of here. Now.
Judah : The blade's rubber.
Castle : Whoa. Is that a bee?
Todd : I'm allergic! I'm very allergic!
Castle : Okay, well, relax. You're antagonizing it.
Todd : I think it's attracted to the substance on my arm!
Martha : Oh, no.
UNK: You all right? Relax, relax.
Castle : You're going into anaphylactic shock. Do you have epinephrine?
Todd : My injector's gone! It was in my pocket! Where is it? where is it?
Judah : It's okay, man. It's okay. We'll find it.
Castle : Guys, there's a picture of a bee. Maybe your epinephrine's in here.
Simon : - What should we do? - Uh...
Castle : we need the password.
Judah : Just breathe. Just breathe, okay? we'll figure this out. Got it?
Castle : Guys, some of the letters have little bees over them.
UNK: What?
UNK: - "A", "D"... - what the hell?
UNK: "E", "I"...
Judah : - Take it easy. - "L", "O"...
Alexis : - Okay? - "P", "R" and "Y".
Judah : - What does that mean? - I don't know.
Castle : It could be a word. Maybe it's a phrase.
UNK: Uh, "dairy pole." No. Um, that's not it.
UNK: Uh, "I play doer."
UNK: "A dire ploy"?
Simon : Guys, he's not looking so good.
Castle : Wait a minute.
UNK: "Play or"
UNK: "die."
Simon : Oh, man, this is so twisted.
Simon : - Oh, thank God. - Hurry. Hurry, hurry.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Ready?
Judah : Whoa. what did you do to him?
Castle : Nothing. I just...
Castle : - It says it's poison. - What?
Castle : That's not...
UNK: "Salvation lies within."
UNK: "Lies"! It was a trick.
Martha : Okay, okay.
UNK: Just open his collar so he can breathe.
Simon : What is that?
Simon : So what the hell are we supposed to do now?
Jennifer : I don't know.
Simon : You were right. whoever's behind this isn't going to kill us.
Simon : He wants us to kill each other.
UNK: It's another clue, right here.
UNK: "Time has run out. 2 will cure. 1 will kill."
Castle : Okay, so that has to mean there's an antidote around here somewhere.
