Beckett : You guys track it down?
Ryan : No traffic cams on her block, so, so far, it's not looking good.
Esposito : Hey, guys, these are Emma's co-workers.
Esposito : This is Lila Campo and Jennifer Perez.
Esposito : This is my partner Detective Ryan, and our boss Captain Beckett.
Beckett : I'm sorry about your loss.
UNK: Lila Campo : Thank you, Captain. We are still in shock.
UNK: - We're gonna talk over here. - Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Follow me, please.
Beckett : Ryan, I'm going to be at the forensic technology seminar all afternoon,
Beckett : so just text me if anything comes up, okay?
UNK: - Yeah, you got it, Cap. - Thanks.
UNK: Jennifer Perez : Oh, my God, is that Emma's blood?
Ryan : Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Ryan : Do you recognize the symbol drawn in the mirror?
Jennifer : I've never seen it before.
Lila : Neither have I.
