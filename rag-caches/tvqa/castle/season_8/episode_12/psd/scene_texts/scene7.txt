Buckley : I don't know what you're talking about.
Buckley : I liked Emma. It's a real shame what happened to her.
Ryan : Yeah, we're sure you're heartbroken.
Ryan : Especially after she supposedly lied
Ryan : to beat you out of that big promotion at work.
Esposito : And now that Emma's dead, that newjob is yours for the taking.
