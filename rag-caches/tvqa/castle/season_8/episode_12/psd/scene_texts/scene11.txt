UNK: What the hell is my wife doing here? And yours?
Judah : They must be leverage.
Judah : To make us follow the rules, or else they get hurt.
Castle : Or maybe we're the leverage.
Judah : What about Todd? He didn't have anyone in that room.
Simon : He's a priest. They're celibate.
Todd : I'm a minister. The rules are different.
Simon : So is there a Mrs. Minister that's not in there?
Todd : No. But that doesn't mean there aren't people I care about.
Todd : If something happened to one of them...
Castle : Look, we don't know enough for you to be worried about that, okay?
Simon : Hell, being locked in this room with a loaded gun
Simon : and instructions to kill one another is plenty to be worried about.
UNK: We're not gonna do that.
Castle : What we should be doing is figuring out why the hell we're here.
Judah : And why are some of us marked with this symbol and others aren't?
Castle : Did you see the symbol on any of the women?
Judah : I saw something on Patricia's neck, but I don't have one.
Castle : - What about your wife? - No.
Castle : - You're sure? - I didn't take my eyes off of her.
Castle : So she doesn't have one, but you do.
Castle : Following that pattern, Beckett must have one because I don't.
Simon : Meaning what?
UNK: Well, what ifthe people with the symbol are the important ones,
Castle : and the rest of us are leverage?
Hayley : There he is.
Alexis : What's he doing in there?
Alexis : Wait. what's going on with that van?
Alexis : Uh, what the hell just happened?
Alexis : Was that my dad?
UNK: So, Buckley sent over those tapes that Emma was digitizing.
UNK: And?
UNK: Well, he's right. It's, uh, weird.
Esposito : What are they doing?
Ryan : Solving puzzles.
