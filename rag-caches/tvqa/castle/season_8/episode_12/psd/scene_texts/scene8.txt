Buckley : Ask anyone there.
Esposito : We will, and it better check out.
Buckley : And just so you guys know,
Buckley : Emma did lie about me to get that promotion.
Buckley : That chick lied all the time.
Simon : What are you talking about?
Buckley : Just yesterday I caught her in the edit bay digitizing old VHS tapes.
UNK: Emma said it was prooffor a story.
Buckley : But I know all the stories she was working on,
Buckley : and those videos had nothing to do with any of them.
UNK: Didn't Emma's co-worker say she just stumbled on some sort of proof?
Esposito : Buckley, what was on those tapes?
Buckley : They were weird home videos of a couple kids sitting around,
Buckley : wearing these strange medallions.
Esposito : Strange, how?
Buckley : I don't know. They had round symbols.
Ryan : Did they look anything like this?
Buckley : Yeah, exactly like that.
Ryan : Are there copies of these VHS tapes she was digitizing?
UNK: Yeah.
Buckley : The system automatically archives the raw footage to the server for backup.
UNK: Hey, how you feeling?
Todd : Better. Thanks for saving me.
UNK: Oh.
Todd : Hey, I don't even know your name.
Castle : That's right, we haven't done proper introductions. I'm Rick.
UNK: Todd.
Simon : - Yeah. My name's Simon. - Judah.
UNK: Well, gentlemen, um, clearly we were all brought here for a reason.
UNK: Maybe ifwe can figure out what it is, it'll be our way out.
