Louis : What? How?
Slaughter : You're a good kid, Louis.
Slaughter : Too good to be rotting in a cell for a few bonehead decisions.
Slaughter : So from now on, I'm gonna personally see to it
UNK: that you got someone looking out for you.
UNK: That you got a cool role model.
Louis : You mean Mr. Castle?
UNK: No.
UNK: Me.
UNK: Really?
Slaughter : You bet.
UNK: First thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use my pull
Slaughter : to get the Mayor to ask the DA to reduce your sentence
Slaughter : down to probation.
Louis : You've got that kind of clout with the Mayor?
Slaughter : Hell, no, but Castle does.
UNK: And I'm gonna see to it that he makes that call.
Slaughter : Or else.
UNK: So you're gonna beat up Mr. Castle if he doesn't do what you ask?
Louis : Some role model.
Slaughter : Yeah, you got a point.
Slaughter : Looks like the two of us are gonna have to do
Slaughter : some role modeling for each other.
Slaughter : Sound good?
