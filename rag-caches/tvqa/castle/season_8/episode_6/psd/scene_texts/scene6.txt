Slaughter : Hey, Trucco!
Slaughter : Time to pay the piper, buddy.
Castle : Hey, hey, hey. what did I just say?
Booth : Huh? Oh.
UNK: Oh.
Slaughter : My apologies, Mr. Trucco.
Slaughter : My name is Detective Slaughter, this is Castle.
Slaughter : We'd like to have a little chat with you about a Victor Lee.
UNK: Brian Trucco : Never heard of him.
Slaughter : Mr. Trucco, we both know that you fence high-tech items for a living.
UNK: And that you had a deal with Victor Lee
Slaughter : to move a certain microchip that he stole.
Slaughter : Now, unless you want us to go check out your place
UNK: and see ifwe can find any stolen merchandise,
Slaughter : I strongly recommend you tell us what we want to know.
Alexis : And what's that?
Castle : Did you buy a stolen microchip
Castle : - from Victor last night? - No.
Slaughter : - Ass clown, I'll tear your face off... - Dude.
Slaughter : Please, sir, tell us the truth.
Trucco : I am.
Trucco : Look, Victor and his partner were supposed to meet me last night,
Trucco : but they never showed.
Castle : Who's his partner?
Trucco : I don't know. But from the way Victor talked about him,
Trucco : it seems like they weren't going to be partners for long.
Castle : - You thinking what I'm thinking? - Uh... Probably not.
Castle : That maybe Victor got greedy, tried to double-cross his partner?
Slaughter : And the partner might've killed him for it.
Slaughter : Nice going, Sherlock. See, we make a perfect team. Let's go.
