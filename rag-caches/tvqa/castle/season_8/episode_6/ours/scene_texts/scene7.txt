Hayley : Well, we haven't seen him for hours. What's going on?
Ryan : Castle stole our car after we arrested Slaughter.
UNK: I'm sorry. That's really not funny.
Hayley : It really is, though.
Esposito : Okay, knock it off.
Alexis : But, wait, wait, why did you arrest Slaughter?
Alexis : According to Dad, he didn't kill Victor Lee.
Ryan : - That's not the point. - It's kind of the point.
Esposito : Look, we had reason to believe that Slaughter killed Victor.
UNK: But now we're not so sure.
UNK: Well, I can tell you this,
UNK: that genius kid, Louis, definitely didn't kill him either.
Ryan : - How do you know that? - While I was tracking
UNK: his IP address with Castle,
Hayley : I noticed that during the time of the murder,
Hayley : Louis was at a coffee shop in Brooklyn.
Alexis : And a barista remembers seeing him.
Esposito : Which makes David Lacey our prime suspect.
Hayley : Who's this Lacey guy?
Esposito : He runs a heist crew with a trail of bodies.
UNK: We got one of his soldiers in holding, but he's not talking.
Alexis : Wait, is my dad in danger?
Ryan : We really need to find him.
UNK: Fast.
Slaughter : Yum, yum, yum.
UNK: Oh.
