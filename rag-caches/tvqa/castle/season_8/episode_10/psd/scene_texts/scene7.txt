UNK: Judge Wollcott : Mr. Castle, you may step down.
UNK: Judge Wollcott : Mr. Castle, you may step down.

UNK: Court is in recess until 9 : 00 a.m.
Weller : Come here.
Castle : Marcus, I'm so sorry.
Castle : I don't know what happened. I got torpedoed.
Weller : No, no, no. You got nuked.
Beckett : - Are you okay? - Beckett, I just blew the entire case.
Beckett : Well, the trial's not over yet. Right, Marcus?
UNK: Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. We've got a serious problem now.
Weller : Castle, you've just given the jury reasonable doubt.
UNK: But there's got to be something we can do, right?
UNK: Well, we have until court resumes tomorrow morning to find new evidence,
Beckett : or another witness who can prove Nina's guilt.
Weller : Yes, however, what can you possibly uncover in less than 16 hours?
Beckett : I don't know, but we have to try.
Esposito : How many more times do we have to go through these case files?
Beckett : As many as it takes.
Ryan : Beckett, we've got stacks and stacks of hay here, but no needles.
