UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Hello, Your Honor, nice to see you again.
UNK: Hoping to make another visit to the holding cells, Mr. Castle?
Castle : No, Your Honor, once was plenty. Thank you.
Castle : And my sincerest apologies for the interruption.
Castle : However, there has been a development in the case.
Beckett : Excuse us, Your Honor,
Beckett : but the defense has a witness to call to the stand.
UNK: Uh, Your Honor, the defense would like to call Richard Castle to the stand.
Beckett : - So, Nina definitely didn't do it. - Tell me something I don't know.
Brown : Like, who did?
Roger : No idea.
Bailiff : Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
Bailiff : - and nothing but the truth? - I do.
UNK: Looks like I get my do-over after all.
UNK: Um, Mr. Castle, yesterday you testified
UNK: that my client was guilty of killing Mrs. Beakman.
Brown : Do you still believe that's true?
Castle : No. Nina's innocent.
Brown : Okay. And when, may I ask,
Brown : did you change your mind about my client?
Castle : When I realized that Nina was a victim, a victim of bad timing.
Castle : First and foremost, my own.
Brown : Bad timing, you say.
Castle : It was my bad timing that brought me to the crime scene too late.
Castle : Had I gotten there earlier,
Castle : I would have seen Nina finding Sadie already stabbed.
Brown : Okay. But then my client ran.
Castle : - Why? - Because she knew how it looked.
Castle : While we're on the topic of bad timing, Iet's not fail to mention
Castle : the timing of Nina originally being paired with a public defender
Castle : who didn't care about the truth, unlike you, sir.
UNK: Um...
UNK: well, Mr. Castle, is there anything else you'd like to share with the court?
Castle : Yes. Good people of the jury, it is frightening to think about,
Castle : but Nina O'Keefe is on trial today
Castle : simply because I needed to use the restroom,
Castle : and the one downstairs...
Castle : Bad timing.
Castle : The bathroom downstairs was occupied.
Castle : Call 911!
