Weller : Please tell me you're joking.
Castle : The fact the basketball hoop was moved is significant
Castle : because Nina didn't have any reason to do it.
Weller : Kate, why am I back here?
Beckett : Marcus, this is a legitimate concern.
Beckett : If Nina didn't move the hoop, then who did? And why?
Weller : Let's stick with what we know.
UNK: Castle saw Nina kill Sadie. End of story.
Castle : I'm not actually 100% sure about that anymore.
Weller : Wait, don't tell me you're buying into Caleb's ridiculous defense.
Weller : Rick, you got your bell rung in court today. It happens.
Weller : Caleb Brown is a hell of an attorney. Now you've got to let it go.
Castle : - So you're not going to investigate? - You saw the tape.
Weller : They were having an affair. It's a crime of passion.
Weller : Nina is guilty, plain and simple.
Castle : Don't we have to be sure?
Weller : Rick, look at me. I'm sure.
UNK: - Marcus, ifwe could just talk to... - Stop!
Weller : This case cannot afford to have you pour any more doubt into people's ears.
Weller : Listen, I know you two are separated and all,
Weller : but could you please talk to him?
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Beckett : Castle, are you sure that Nina's innocent?
Castle : I don't know.
Castle : But what's worse than letting a guilty person go free?
Beckett : Sending an innocent one to jail.
UNK: AII right, go home. I'll sneak by later.
