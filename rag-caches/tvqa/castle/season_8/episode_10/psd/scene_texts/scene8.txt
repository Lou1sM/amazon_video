Ryan : I think we need a new strategy.
Castle : I can't believe how badly I blew it up there.
UNK: This is my fault, guys. I'm sorry.
Ryan : Don't do that to yourself.
Ryan : We've all been tripped up on the witness stand.
Esposito : True. Back when I was in uniform,
Esposito : a defense attorney got my head so turned around
UNK: that I testified the defendant actually kicked my ass when I tried to arrest her.
Castle : What's wrong with that?
UNK: The defendant was a 75-year-old woman in a wheelchair.
Esposito : I lost all credibility with the jury.
Ryan : To this day, we pass the park where she feeds the birds,
Ryan : she snickers, turns to her nurse, and tells her the tale
Ryan : of how she got one over on poor little Javi.
UNK: Ms. Lucinda. I will get her one day.
UNK: But have any ofyou botched your testimony in a murder trial?
UNK: Exactly.
Beckett : Hey, Espo, that story about Ms. Lucinda,
Beckett : so she still talks about how she made a fool out ofyou?
Esposito : Yes. Thank you for rubbing it in, Captain Beckett.
UNK: No, you guys, we're approaching this wrong.
Beckett : I mean, we've been trying to find a clue from the murder,
Beckett : whereas we should be looking for a clue from after the murder.
UNK: Yes.
Castle : Nina's been held since her arrest.
