UNK: Allright, let's get out of here.
Beckett : - But you didn't leave it, did you? - You can see on the tape that we did.
Beckett : Sure, and then once you stopped recording,
Beckett : you went back to get it.
Esposito : Over a billion dollars in cash went missing during the Iraq invasion.
Esposito : What's a lousy five mil?
Esposito : - You couldn't just leave it, could you? - Yeah, that's exactly what I did.
Beckett : Except Sadie didn't, did she?
Esposito : No, she didn't.
Roger : She snuck back and took it for herself.
Roger : And then she smuggled it to the States, tried to cut me out.
Beckett : But you had the tape, and you used that to blackmail her
Beckett : so you could get your share.
Esposito : But Sadie didn't like you having all that leverage.
Esposito : What I can't figure out is,
Esposito : what took Sadie so long to try to get this tape back from you?
Beckett : Oh, I get it.
Beckett : You burned through the money that Sadie gave you originally,
Beckett : - so you needed more. - I am mortgaged to the hilt, okay?
UNK: AII my credit cards are maxed, and my wife won't stop spending!
UNK: Hell, she forked over 15 G's to that stupid charity auction
