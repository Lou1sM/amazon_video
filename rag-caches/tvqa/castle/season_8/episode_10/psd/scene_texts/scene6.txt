UNK: Yeah, that was 3XK, the serial killer.
Castle : He had a vendetta against me. That was different.
Brown : Why is it different for you, but not for my client?
Brown : What makes you so special, Mr. Castle?
Brown : Dr. Parish testified that the victim, Mrs. Beakman, was alive
UNK: for five to 10 minutes after being stabbed, and in excruciating pain.
Brown : Might it be that my client simply came across the victim
Brown : after the true killer stabbed her and fled?
Castle : - But that... - This is not one ofyour stories, sir!
Brown : You do not get to make up the facts as you see fit!
Brown : Now, my client is fighting for her life,
Brown : just as you once fought for yours against 3XK.
Brown : So, now, I ask you one last time.
Brown : Is it possible, Mr. Castle,
Brown : that my client did not kill Mrs. Beakman?
