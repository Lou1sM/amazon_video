Castle : That's like asking Superman not to be too super.
Castle : What's wrong with being too charming?
Beckett : Nothing, except when you are testifying in a murder trial.
Beckett : Look, being charming tells the jury that you're confident.
Beckett : But being too charming tells them that you're trying to be manipulative.
Castle : Oh, I see.
Castle : This is why you never had me testify in any of our cases.
Castle : You're jealous of my charm.
Beckett : I'm serious, okay? Don't get cocky.
Beckett : This is the first time you'll be testifying in court,
UNK: and it can get nerve-racking.
Castle : I'll be fine.
Castle : Especially since word on the street is the defense lawyer is a total hack.
Beckett : Oh, yeah? who is it?
Castle : Stan Novak.
UNK: Short-attention-span Stan?
Beckett : That guy gets lost in his own cross-examinations.
Beckett : Yeah, you will be fine.
Castle : Too bad you won't be there to see me in action.
Beckett : - No, but I will. - Is that wise?
Castle : I mean, publicly, aren't we still supposed to be separated?
Beckett : This is the Sadie Beakman murder trial we're talking about.
Beckett : Her reporting from Iraq shaped the way many Americans saw the war.
