Nina : I was trying to help her.
Castle : So, then, why did you run?
Nina : I knew how it looked. I panicked.
Castle : Why didn't you tell that to the police when they caught you?
Nina : Please. I've been arrested before.
Nina : And I got screwed over. You know why?
Nina : Because none of the cops believed me.
Nina : I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice.
Castle : - Did you at least tell your lawyer? - Of course.
