UNK: Maybe they'd had one,
Castle : and Sadie's daughter was actually Roger's.
Beckett : So, uh, what, you think that Sadie cooked this whole thing up
Beckett : so she could get a DNA sample for a paternity test?
Castle : Only one way to find out.
Ryan : What do you want us to do, Captain?
Man : - I... - Beckett, look.
UNK: Uh, go talk to Roger. See what he knows.
Vikram : - What is he doing here? - I'll handle this. You just be normal.
Brown : Captain, you crossed the line.
Brown : I know that you had Castle go in and interview my client...
UNK: Look, Counselor, Castle and I are separated.
UNK: He's no longer associated with the 12th Precinct.
Beckett : So neither I, nor the NYPD can be held accountable for his actions.
Brown : - So you knew nothing about it? - That's what I said, isn't it?
Brown : - I don't believe you. - And I don't care.
Brown : Typical cop.
UNK: Wait.
UNK: What?
UNK: Look, ifyou repeat what I'm about to tell you, I will deny it.
Beckett : I have people looking into Nina's case.
Brown : - Do you believe that she's innocent? - I didn't say that.
UNK: But I think we have to be thorough.
Beckett : And now that the trial has been postponed,
Beckett : we have time to investigate further.
Brown : I appreciate that, Captain.
Beckett : Counselor, Nina wasn't your client until yesterday morning.
Beckett : Why are you so passionate about this case?
