UNK: Yo, how's it hanging, jailbird?
Ryan : You already pissed off the ADA, so, what, you figured,
Ryan : why the hell not piss off the judge as well?
Castle : Yeah. Can you guys get me out of here?
Esposito : Already done. The bailiff called us to come get you.
Castle : I'm going to figure out what happened.
Castle : I promise.
UNK: Are you out ofyour mind?
Castle : I didn't do anything wrong.
Beckett : You tricked a judge to postpone a trial,
Beckett : and then you illegally questioned the defendant.
Castle : Yeah, but other than that, I didn't do anything wrong.
Esposito : Yo, Beckett, Castle's convinced that Nina is innocent now.
Beckett : Because what? Because Sadie wanted Roger's glass?
Castle : I think she was after his DNA.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Roger was her cameraman for 20 years.
Castle : Nina said that Sadie had had affairs with men in the past.
