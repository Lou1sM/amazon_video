UNK: It's Caleb Brown.
UNK: Yes.
UNK: Yeah?
UNK: Yeah.
Brown : Yeah, I'm on my way.
UNK: So while the judge was heading home,
Brown : she called a neighbor who checked on her house.
Ryan : Turns out the house was not burglarized.
Brown : Anyway, she's ordered that the trial resume in a half an hour.
UNK: So ifyour people are going to help prove Nina's innocence,
UNK: they'd better hurry.
Castle : - You again. - Hello, Roger, we need to talk.
Roger : Well, now what?
UNK: Joanna.
Joanna : Well, hello!
Castle : Sorry for the interruption. This won't take long.
UNK: It actually can't. The trial is gonna start again in a few minutes,
Castle : and we need to nail down who the real killer is
Castle : before an innocent woman gets convicted.
Roger : What do you mean, innocent? You saw that woman kill Sadie.
UNK: No, Roger. I only thought I did.
Castle : You see, the mind is a funny thing.
Castle : It doesn't like a vacuum, so it fills in the blanks.
