Nina : Hey. My trial was supposed to begin, Iike, five minutes ago.
Nina : What's going on?
Officer : Judge postponed your trial until tomorrow.
Officer : You'll be transported back to Rikers at the end of day.
Castle : Hey, so what are you in for?
Castle : Sorry, bad joke.
Nina : Don't talk to me.
Castle : Nina, look, I know about the affair with Sadie.
Castle : The ADA knows it, too. He is going to use it to bury you.
Nina : Why are you telling me this?
Castle : I was there, Nina. I saw you.
Castle : I saw you with my own eyes.
Nina : I didn't kill Sadie. I loved her.
Nina : So, yeah, you were there, but you saw it wrong.
Castle : So tell me what I missed.
Nina : I found Sadie on the ground.
Nina : Someone had already stabbed her.
Nina : She was struggling to breathe. So I pulled the poker out.
