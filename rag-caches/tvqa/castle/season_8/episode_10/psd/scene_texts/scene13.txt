UNK: Okay. I will have my people track down former employees of this bar,
Weller : and hopefully one of them can corroborate the affair.
Beckett : Okay, and I'll have my team touch base with Sadie's family and friends.
Beckett : Maybe they can shed some light as to what was behind this little love affair.
Castle : You see, Marcus?
Castle : And you were worried.
Beckett : Okay, boys, we found Nina's coffin.
Beckett : Now, let's nail it shut.
Esposito : I'll talk to Nina's employees.
UNK: And I'll go talk with her friends.
Roger : Sadie was having an affair with that woman?
Roger : That is so twisted.
Joanna : Well, you never know what goes on behind closed doors.
Ryan : So you knew nothing about Sadie's extramarital affairs?
Roger : She was good at keeping secrets.
Castle : Then why hire the catering company that Nina worked for?
Roger : Sadie's recommendation.
UNK: She went to an event that they catered, said the food was amazing.
Joanna : I bet that's how Sadie and Nina met. What do you think, Richard?
Castle : Entirely possible.
Joanna : See, I told you I was a Nikki Heat fan. I even think like her, too.
Castle : - It's uncanny. - I know.
Castle : It's good that you moved the basketball hoop away from the townhouse.
Ryan : Oh, yeah, those things, they're just an invitation for burglars to break in.
Castle : Or murderers, like Nina, to break out.
Joanna : Well, we always keep the hoop there. Nina moved it.
Roger : Yeah, we didn't even realize that she had until the day after the murder.
Castle : How are you sure it was Nina that moved it?
Joanna : Well, if it wasn't her, who else could it have been?
UNK: Ryan, a moment. Excuse us.
Castle : The basketball hoop being moved speaks to a premeditative act.
UNK: Yeah, but our theory of this whole thing is a crime of passion.
Ryan : - What are you thinking? - That we don't know the whole story.
Castle : Someone else was up here before I caught Nina over Sadie.
