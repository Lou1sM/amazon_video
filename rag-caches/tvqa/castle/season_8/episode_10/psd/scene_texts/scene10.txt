Bridget : Probably because I was high on crack at the time.
Esposito : Just answer the question.
Esposito : Has Nina revealed anything about the murder?
UNK: Yup. And between the three of us, she's guilty as hell.
Ryan : What do you know?
Ryan : Okay, Bridget, what do you want?
Bridget : Oh, what does any girl want, Detective?
Ryan : The personal satisfaction of bringing a killer to justice?
UNK: 50 bucks in my prison commissary every week for the next 10 weeks.
UNK: 40 bucks for five weeks.
Bridget : Eight. And that's as low as I'll go.
Esposito : Deal, but you better have some solid information.
Esposito : Now, has Nina confessed to the murder?
UNK: No. But I know she did it.
Bridget : Look, here's the deal with Nina.
Bridget : She's a mouse. Doesn't talk much.
Bridget : Then one day she lets slip
Bridget : she's worried the prosecution might find out about her secret.
Ryan : What secret?
Bridget : Didn't say.
Bridget : I think it has to do with her boyfriend or something.
Ryan : What boyfriend?
Esposito : If Nina has a secret boyfriend out there,
Esposito : - there's a chance she confessed to him. - Yeah.
Castle : No, I'm just trying to figure out who Nina was dating when she was arrested.
