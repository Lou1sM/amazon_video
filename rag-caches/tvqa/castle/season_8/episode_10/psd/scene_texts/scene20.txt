UNK: That fight was about a couple of things.
Nina : I was sick of sneaking around.
Nina : But Sadie was all paranoid
UNK: because she'd been caught cheating with other guys in the past.
Nina : Other guys?
Castle : So you were her first...
Nina : Lesbian? Yes. Is that a problem?
Castle : No, not with me. You should check my search history.
Castle : But you said you were arguing about a couple of things.
Nina : What really pissed me off
Nina : was that Sadie asked me to do something at that cocktail party.
Castle : What did she ask you to do?
Nina : Bring her Roger Masters' empty champagne glass.
Castle : Roger Masters, the host?
Castle : Why would she want his empty glass?
Nina : She wouldn't say.
