Alexis : And a brand synonymous with family values.
Alexis : Which is ironic, since he's a renowned playboy,
Alexis : already on wife number three.
Castle : You say that like it's a bad thing.
UNK: Oh, and here's a fun fact.
Alexis : Keller's last divorce featured a prenup that was nullified by,
Alexis : you guessed it, his wife's infidelity.
Ryan : So, George Keller has used Scott's services before.
Esposito : And if Scott was seducing the current Mrs. Keller
Esposito : when he had his big change of heart...
Alexis : He might have turned on George and threatened to expose him.
UNK: Which would've damaged the company's wholesome reputation.
Castle : So Keller killed Scott to keep him quiet.
Lanie : Scott McCoy?
UNK: George Keller : Sorry, I have no idea who that is.
Esposito : Well, that's funny.
Esposito : Because your second wife did.
Esposito : She recognized him immediately after I showed her this picture.
Esposito : Guess it's hard to forget somebody
Esposito : who cost you millions in a broken prenup.
Keller : It's not my fault she slept around.
