Ryan : Don't move, or I'll shoot your ass.
Esposito : He'll do it, too. Trust me.
Beckett : I'm still surprised that you jumped in front of a bullet for this guy.
Esposito : Me, too. I mean, normally, his slow-as-molasses ass is never that fast.
Esposito : - But he was just like... - Like...
UNK: AII right. what about George Keller?
Beckett : We picked him up at the airport.
Beckett : Lindsey confessed that they were in on it together.
Beckett : And he was trying to leave the country in a private jet.

UNK: Well, looks like he's gonna have to postpone renewing his vows
UNK: for another, what, 30 to life?
Esposito : - Yeah. - Right?
Beckett : Anyway, guys, I have to get going.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Um, unless you still want me to put in those new-partner requests.
UNK: Uh, no, not tonight.
UNK: I am gonna need somebody eventually,
Ryan : when this guy gets bumped up to sergeant.
Esposito : Well, that's not going to happen anytime soon.
UNK: I'm number 279 on a list of 300, so...
UNK: we're gonna be stuck together for a while.
Beckett : I like the sound of that.
UNK: Ifthat's cool with you.
UNK: Yeah.
Ryan : If it's cool with you.
Esposito : Is it cool with me?
Esposito : Bro, you took a bullet for me.
Esposito : You've got a wife, a pregnant wife at home,
UNK: and you've got a little girl who depends on you,
Esposito : and yet you still...
UNK: I'm just gonna give you guys a moment. Sorry.
UNK: Wanna come over, watch some UFC?

UNK: No, I know. No, it's just a time-out from the time-out.
Esposito : - Yeah. - Yeah.
UNK: So...
UNK: Time-in?
Esposito : - Yeah. - Yeah.
UNK: That was even better than I remembered.
Beckett : Yeah. well, I had to leave a few moves for year two.
Hayley : - Rick? - Mmm-hmm.
Beckett : When you were in that divorce lawyer's office, I was watching.
Castle : Why, Captain Beckett, I had no idea.
Castle : I feel so violated.
Beckett : Look, I know you were just playing a role, but...
Beckett : when she asked you ifthere was any hope for us,
Beckett : and you didn't say anything, I was...
UNK: Kate.
Castle : I have never given up hope.
Castle : Not since the day we met.
Castle : And that'll never change until you tell me it should.
UNK: Well, then don't change.
UNK: Ever.
Ryan : - Okay. - Okay.
Beckett : I have to go.
UNK: I guess the time-out's over.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : I'll be right back.
Castle : Hey. I think your phone buzzed.
UNK: Oh.
Castle : Everything all right?
Beckett : Yeah, fine.
Beckett : Okay, I'll see you around.
Hayley : See you.
