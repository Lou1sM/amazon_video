Beckett : - It was an accident, Jav. - Oh, was it?
Esposito : - You sure about that? - Yeah.
Beckett : And deep down in your heart, you are, too.
Esposito : It doesn't matter.
Esposito : Once the trust is gone, it's really hard to get it back.
Beckett : No, that's not true. A strong relationship can survive anything.
Castle : No relationship can survive secrets.
Castle : Or lies.
Castle : Now, you need to tell Esposito the truth.
Castle : That you were hurt and jealous that he passed the test and you didn't.
Ryan : Forget that. He rubbed it in my face, remember?
Ryan : - Sergeant Esposito. - You need to apologize.
