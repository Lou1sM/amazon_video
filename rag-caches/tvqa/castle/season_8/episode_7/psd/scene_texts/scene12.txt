Nancy : And to find out that I was just another paycheck...
Nancy : So I went to confront him.
Nancy : But I didn't even get to yell at him.
Nancy : He apologized to me before I could get a word out.
Nancy : Said he was a horrible human being for what he'd done.
Beckett : And why did he have this sudden change of heart?
UNK: He said that he'd learned something working his lastjob,
Nancy : something upsetting.
Beckett : So, did he tell you what his lastjob was?
Nancy : It was another seduction, but he didn't say who.
Nancy : Just that he had screwed over a good person,
Nancy : and he wanted to make it right.
Nancy : Or die trying.
UNK: So, Nancy's car service driver confirms that our vic was alive when Nancy left.
UNK: He helped her into the car at 12 : 15.
UNK: Then the driver took Nancy all the way out to Greenwich.
Beckett : Okay. So she's not our killer.
Beckett : Maybe Scott's murder has something to do with that lastjob he was working.
Beckett : Let's see who Scott screwed over
Beckett : and what he was doing to make it right the night that he was killed.
Ryan : And I think I know where to start looking.
UNK: Nancy's husband and his friends
Ryan : all used the same lawyer to bust up their prenups.
Ryan : Some hotshot named Lindsey Trent.
