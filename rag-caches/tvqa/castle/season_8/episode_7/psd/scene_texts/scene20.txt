Esposito : Trust me, you don't want to hear what I really think.
Ryan : - Oh, bring it on! - AII right.

Esposito : who shot me in the ass on purpose!
Ryan : And you are an arrogant, man-scaped Neanderthal.
Ryan : And it wasn't on purpose. Next time, it's gonna be.
Esposito : - That's it, I want a new partner! - Me, too!
Castle : Oh, we can't leave them like this, can we?
Beckett : - I'll talk to Javi. - I'll see if I can calm Ryan down.
UNK: - Rain check on dinner? - Yeah.
UNK: Yeah.
Ryan : How did it all go so wrong?
Ryan : I mean, one day we're a team,

Castle : You shot him in the ass.
