Lindsey : Okay. Let's not get sidetracked here.
Lindsey : The simple fact is you're investigating a murder,
Lindsey : which my client has nothing to do with.
Esposito : - So we should just take your word for it? - Of course not.
Lindsey : I will provide my client's whereabouts the night that Mr. McCoy was killed.
Keller : And you guys need to get your facts straight.
Keller : I'm not looking to divorce my wife.
Keller : We're renewing our vows next weekend.
UNK: You know we're gonna Iook into that, right?
Keller : Oh, please, do.
Beckett : - In fact... - George.
Keller : I'll even send you the insurance papers
UNK: for the two-million-dollar ring I'm giving her.
UNK: Keller is telling the truth.
Esposito : He and his third wife are renewing their vows
UNK: next week in the Caribbean.
UNK: And that two-million-dollar rock is legit.
Esposito : I was just about to say that.
Ryan : Oh, really? I thought you were about to tell her
Ryan : how you're still struggling to verify Keller's alibi.
Esposito : - Oh, I'm struggling? - Yeah, you're struggling.
Beckett : You guys, come on.
UNK: Guys!
UNK: AII right. Tell me about Keller's alibi.
Esposito : I'm still trying to confirm that he was at his office when Scott was murdered.
Beckett : Okay. well, until we can verify that, then he is still a suspect.
UNK: And my gut says he's hiding something. So, find it.
Castle : And your gut is never wrong.
Castle : You know, I know some people in Keller's circle.
Castle : I could put my feelers out.
UNK: - Uh, yeah, thanks, Castle. - My pleasure.
Castle : How are things between the boys?
Beckett : Not good, actually.
UNK: - I'm kind ofworried about them. - They'll work it out.
Castle : They've been through way too much together to give up on what they have.
Beckett : You're a wise man, Castle.
Beckett : With a big heart.
UNK: You're rather good-Iooking, too.
UNK: Might wanna pace yourself on the flattery,
UNK: you've got a whole dinner to get through.
