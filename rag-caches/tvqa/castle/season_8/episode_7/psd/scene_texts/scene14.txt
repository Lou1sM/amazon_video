Castle : - Have you been here long? - These are our new offices.
Beckett : Is that the lawyer?
UNK: Uh, that is the live stream from Castle's glasses.
Beckett : So, you guys sent Castle on a surveillance mission
Beckett : after I told you he was not to work anymore NYPD cases?
Ryan : We didn't think you should know.
Ryan : We were trying to protect you.
Beckett : By sending my husband to the city's top divorce attorney?
Esposito : Happy anniversary?
Beckett : Do you guys have any idea how risky this is?
Beckett : This could blow the entire case.
Beckett : Our involvement in, and knowledge of, this operation is over.
UNK: So, tell me, what happened with you and Kate Beckett, right?
Lindsey : The NYPD detective?
Castle : Oh, uh, she's a captain, actually.
Lindsey : She moved up the ladder quickly.
Castle : Yes, well, she's very good at what she does.
UNK: And that is the root ofyour problem, isn't it?
Lindsey : She's so focused on work, she doesn't have anything left for you?
Lindsey : Don't look so surprised.
Lindsey : It's a story I've heard all too often.
Lindsey : But like the stories you write, Mr. Castle,
Lindsey : You get to choose how this ends.
