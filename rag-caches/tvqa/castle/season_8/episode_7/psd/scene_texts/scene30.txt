Esposito : Did you just try to wipe them off?
Esposito : Because blood residue can be one stubborn son of a bitch.
UNK: And like I said, I'm taking you in...
Esposito : - Lindsey, calm down. - Shut up.
Esposito : - Just calm down. - Just shut up and let me think!
Esposito : Now, listen to me.
Esposito : You're a brilliant lawyer.
Esposito : You might still beat this.

Esposito : I can't do that.
UNK: Javi!
UNK: Kevin?
UNK: Kevin!
Ryan : I'm okay.
Esposito : Your notepad stopped the bullet.
Ryan : How about that?
Ryan : Isn't that why you put it there?

UNK: Just help me up before the psycho bitch gets away.

Beckett : And he was trying to leave the country in a private jet.
Beckett : So, there you go.
UNK: Well, looks like he's gonna have to postpone renewing his vows
