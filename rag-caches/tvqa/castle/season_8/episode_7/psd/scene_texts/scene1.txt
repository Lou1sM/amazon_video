Castle : - while I set up a surprise in her office. - I don't know, Castle.
Ryan : Beckett doesn't want you hanging around the precinct.
Castle : It's just a little surprise.
Esposito : Castle, nothing you do is little.
UNK: Yeah, probably come in riding on an elephant.
Esposito : And then he takes her and the elephant up in a hot air balloon.
UNK: Well, the first anniversary's paper, but otherwise that's not a bad idea.
Esposito : Wait a minute.
Esposito : We're not arguing.
Esposito : - He's our buffer. - He's our buffer.
UNK: Oh...
UNK: Let me guess. Little trouble in therapy?
UNK: Yeah, well, we need someone to follow us around
Ryan : and keep us from fighting.
Castle : I would love to, guys.
Castle : But my schedule is just so...
Esposito : we'll help you with your little surprise.

Castle : Hello, Lanie.
Castle : You are looking lovely today.
UNK: Lanie Parish : I look lovely every day, Castle.
UNK: Lanie Parish : And no, you cannot see the body.
Castle : Why does everyone assume I'm here about the case?
Esposito : It's okay, Lanie, he's with us.
Esposito : So what do we know about our victim?
Lanie : Name's Scott McCoy.
Lanie : According to neighbors, he's an unemployed actor.
Lanie : Sure had the looks for it.
UNK: Mr. Killer spared his face.
UNK: His body, though... Ugh.
Lanie : Nine separate entry wounds.
Lanie : Lividity puts the stabbing between midnight and 2 : 00 a.m.
Ryan : Nine entry wounds. That sounds like a crime of passion.
Castle : Yeah. Either that, or someone wanted to be really, really sure.
UNK: And we may have an idea ofwho that someone is.
Lanie : The weapon was wiped clean,
Lanie : but CSU found prints on the knife block where the killer got it.
UNK: Waiting to hear ifthey're in the system.
UNK: AII right, I'll follow up with CSU.
Esposito : Ryan, why don't you grab a couple of unis and start a canvass...
