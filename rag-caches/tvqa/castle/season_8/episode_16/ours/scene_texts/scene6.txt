UNK: You broke into my GG's apartment.
Joey : My shotgun is registered,
Joey : and I have a right to defend my property,
UNK: so y'all got nothing to hold me on.
Esposito : You like sharks, Joey?
UNK: Yeah, they cool, I guess.
Beckett : What's your favorite shark?
Esposito : I like the ones with the funny shaped heads.
Esposito : You know what I'm talking about?
Beckett : Yeah. The hammerheads.
Esposito : Yeah. That's it. That's funny, because we heard that you were Hammerhead.
Joey : Yeah? who told you that?
Joey : Wait, that girl that was with you earlier.
Joey : I knew she looked familiar.
Beckett : Hammerheads aren't usually man-killers, Joey.
Beckett : So, what happened?
UNK: Oof!
Joey : I don't know what you're talking about.
Esposito : Ten years ago you were part of a heist group
Esposito : that used gelatin mixed with perfume to disable security systems.
Esposito : Last night, you used the same recipe to break into a high-security warehouse.
Esposito : Only thing is, you got caught and you murdered a guard.
Joey : Last night I was in Jersey, at my Chicken-Chicken-Chicken.
Joey : It's a chicken restaurant.
Joey : I own seven in the tri-state area.
Esposito : Let me guess,
Esposito : you bought those with your share of the gold-coin heist.
Joey : Even if I did, the statute of limitations is over.
Joey : And I have a dozen witnesses that put me at the Chicken-Chicken-Chicken
UNK: Until 3 : 00 a.m.
UNK: So you ain't gonna touch me with this score either.
Beckett : That doesn't mean you weren't a part of the heist.
Beckett : How else would they know about the gelatin formula?
Joey : Easy, I ain't the only one who knew it.
