Sonia : Come on, hurry up!
UNK: I think we better slow down a little bit.
Esposito : There we go. That's much better.
Ryan : I still can't believe Javi was engaged to that woman.
UNK: Well, I can.
Castle : I mean, you see the electricity between those two? It crackles.
Ryan : Yeah, it might be a problem. We need to keep an eye on her.
Castle : Actually, I think we can do more than that.
Castle : There's a listening device built into Sonia's ankle monitor.
Ryan : - A hidden mic? - Yeah.
UNK: AII we have to do is enter the security number into the app,
Castle : we can hear everything they're saying.
Ryan : But they wouldn't know that we were listening.
Ryan : That would be an invasion of their privacy.
Castle : - You got a problem with that? - No.
UNK: No.
Sonia : You know, I'm glad you didn't get fat over all that guilt.
Esposito : What guilt?
Sonia : For turning me in.
Esposito : Why would I feel guilty about doing my job?
Sonia : Because you love me.
Esposito : Loved you.
Esposito : Past tense. way past.
Esposito : Done. Finished.
UNK: Terminado.
Lucy : You know, I was meaning to say thank you.
Esposito : For what?
Sonia : For arresting me.
Sonia : You saved me the misery of spending another day with you.
Ryan : That's harsh.
UNK: How's your abuelita's hip?
Esposito : Good. She finally got it replaced.
Sonia : Oh, good.
Sonia : She was always so sweet.
Sonia : Your whole family was.
Sonia : That's what haunts me, you know.
UNK: Thinking how they must've reacted
Sonia : when they learned I was nothing more than a crook.
UNK: If Great white met Hammerhead here,
UNK: it stands to reason that somebody knows his real identity.
Sonia : Yeah, but that was nine years ago. Where do we start?
UNK: Bartender.
Sonia : He's bound to know where the old-timers are.
Darren : - Yeah? - Yeah.
UNK: Letme do the talking.
Bartender : What's going on, guys?
Bartender : - What can I get for you? - Um...
UNK: Uh, shots oftequila. Double rows.
UNK: What?
UNK: Double rows, coming up.
Sonia : - Thank you, baby. - What is she doing?
Castle : She's blending into her environment.
Castle : It's actually a brilliant strategy.
Ryan : Either that, or getting Javier drunk.
Castle : Why would she want to do that?
Ryan : Exactly. Exactly.
Bartender : Ding, ding.
Bartender : We got a winner.
Sonia : Set us up again.
UNK: Ifyou say so.
Esposito : Hey, bro, how long you been bartending here?
UNK: Little over 10 years.
Esposito : So then you remember a guy named Jimmy Sanchez?
Esposito : Went by the name of Great white?
Bartender : Great white. Yeah. Yeah. why you ask?
UNK: Did you ever see him with this, you know,
UNK: really good-Iooking kid from the neighborhood?
Sonia : Short, with a beard.
Bartender : - No. Sorry. - It's all good.
UNK: I just got out on parole from a little job we did back in the day.
Sonia : So, if I could just find him...
Esposito : How about now?
Bartender : What the hell are you doing, bro?
