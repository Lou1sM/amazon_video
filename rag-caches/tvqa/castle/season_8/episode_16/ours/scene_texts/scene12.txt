Esposito : And you will.
Ryan : Nine years ago, I found out you were a thief.
UNK: - Do you know what I did then? - Yeah.
Sonia : - You arrested me. - No.
Esposito : I went home.
Esposito : And I packed a bag.
Esposito : And then I grabbed my passport.
Esposito : Cleared out my savings account.
Esposito : I was ready to abandon everything I believed in
Esposito : because I couldn't picture a life without you.
Esposito : Why didn't you?
Esposito : I'm a cop. Sonia, I...
Esposito : It's all I ever wanted to be.
Esposito : If I threw that away, then I wouldn't even deserve you.
UNK: But we got a second chance, Javi.
Sonia : We can run now. It can be like it was.
UNK: No.
Esposito : It can never be like it was.
Esposito : If I was strong enough to walk up those steps
Esposito : and arrest the love of my life,
Esposito : then you're strong enough to face what comes next.
UNK: NYPD!
Ryan : You okay, partner?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Come on. Let's go.
UNK: Please.
Esposito : I'm sorry. I screwed up.
Esposito : I let my feelings for Sonia cloud my judgment
Esposito : and I let my guard down.
UNK: Look, I'm not gonna pretend that I haven't done the same thing,
UNK: but I'm Captain now, so I have to suspend you for a week.
Beckett : No pay.
Esposito : Yes, ma'am.
Beckett : You did the right thing.
Esposito : Can you give us a sec?
Esposito : So, I talked to the DA
UNK: and when the dust settles, he's willing to let you plead out as an accessory
UNK: ifyou testify against Ronaldo.
Sonia : How many more years?
Esposito : At least two.
UNK: Are you gonna come visit me this time?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Are you gonna bring me a cake with a file in it?
Esposito : Probably not.
Sonia : Thank God you didn't go bald.
Esposito : I was just thinking the same thing about you.
UNK: Take care ofyourself, Sonia.
Sonia : You, too.
Esposito : I'll see you soon.
Beckett : I hope so.
UNK: So, what are you going to do now?
Darren : I don't know. Turns out I got the rest of the day free.
Ryan : Yeah, me too. I, uh, just called in sick.
Ryan : Let's go get really drunk.
Esposito : Damn straight.
UNK: Home at last. And with all the makings of a perfect evening.
Castle : Thai food, a bottle of pinot and my two favorite ladies.
Beckett : Wait. Two? Is that a joke about my boobs?
Castle : I'm referring, of course, to you and Lucy.
Beckett : Oh, right. Lucy.
Castle : Oh, come on, don't be mad, I'm kidding.
Castle : Is it too late to say it's about your boobs?
UNK: No, it's fine.
UNK: The truth is that I overreacted the other day.
Beckett : I have a feeling that Lucy and I are gonna be
UNK: on much better terms from here on in.
UNK: And I'm glad to hear it. You hear that, Lucy?
Castle : I knew you'd win her over.
Castle : Now, why don't you dim the lights for us just a little bit?
Linus : How's that, Rick?
UNK: Are the lights not to yoursatisfaction?
UNK: No, they're fine, it's just...
Castle : who are you and where's Lucy?
Linus : My name's Linus.
Linus : And I'm starting to think you don'tlike me.
Castle : Oh, okay. Very funny. what did you do?
Beckett : I read the user's manual.
Beckett : And apparently, with the simple flick of a switch,
Beckett : she can become a he.
Castle : - You killed Lucy? - No.
Beckett : I didn't kill her. I mean, she's still in there.
Beckett : Why? You want her back?
Castle : No. Of course not. No. No. Linus it is.
UNK: AII right. Good. Well, I'm gonna go change.
Beckett : So, why don't you guys become acquainted?
UNK: AII right.
Castle : Okay, Linus, Iet's get this bromance started.
Castle : How about you make me a little cappuccino?
Linus : It's a little late for caffeine, Rick.
Linus : How about some relaxing yoga stretches before bed?
Castle : And experiment's over. Where is that switch?
UNK: Ow!
Castle : Linus, you gave me a little shock.
Castle : I think you must have a short or something.
Linus : I don't like to be touched, Rick. Not by you, anyway.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Beckett!
