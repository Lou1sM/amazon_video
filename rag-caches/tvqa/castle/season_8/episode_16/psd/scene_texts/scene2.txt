UNK: Lanie Parish : Castle, so happy you and Beckett are back together.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Now do us all a favor and don't mess things up with her again.
Castle : Why do you assume it was my fault?
UNK: Everything's your fault.
Lanie : Now, come meet our new victim.
Lanie : Michael Kirby. Single GSw.
UNK: Our thief/killer repelled from that AC duct.
Esposito : And they got away with $100,000 in cash.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : This is Darren Ives.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : He was inside when he heard the shot, rushed out,
UNK: Kevin Ryan : but the killer was already gone.
Darren : I don't know how that guy did it.
Darren : I mean, this is a high-security warehouse.
Darren : It's damn near Fort Knox.
Esposito : And you didn't see anything suspicious?
Darren : Nothing. It was just a normal drop.
Ryan : Let's finish taking your statement over here, please.
Lanie : Your allergies acting up?
Castle : What is this, gelatin?
Castle : It smells like ladies' perfume.
Castle : What is that scent? Is that white Diamonds?
Castle : No. Chanel No. 5.
UNK: Ah!
Castle : One Direction body spray. Nailed it.
UNK: This stuff dripped from the AC vent.
Lanie : CSU took samples.
Lanie : It's from the alarm sensors in the vent.
Lanie : Apparently, the killer used it to disable the security system.
Esposito : Lanie, can you ask the lab to put a rush on this?
Castle : Why, what is it?
Esposito : I've seen this MO before.
UNK: It was, like, 10 years ago.
UNK: So, when you worked with the 54th?
Esposito : Yeah. I collared a thief. Name was, uh, Sonia Ruiz.
