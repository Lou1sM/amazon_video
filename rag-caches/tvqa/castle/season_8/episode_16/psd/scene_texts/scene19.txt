Ronaldo : You go up. I'll stay here with him.
Esposito : Careful, baby.
UNK: Wow. I haven't seen you smile like that since I gave you the ring.
Ronaldo : Shut up.
Esposito : Seems so long ago, doesn't it?
Sonia : It was a different life.
Esposito : What are you doing?
Ronaldo : We can't carry the gold and watch him at the same time.
Ronaldo : So, this is where his story ends.
Michael : - No. - Come on, babe.
Ronaldo : Don't even pretend like you didn't know it was gonna go down this way.
UNK: Turn away if you don't wanna see it.
Bartender : What the hell?
Sonia : I can't let you do that.
Ronaldo : We don't have time for this. He's gotta die, and we gotta go.
Sonia : No. we leave him here. Alive.
Ronaldo : He left you to rot in prison. I was the one who was there for you.
Ronaldo : So, why are you willing to shoot me to save him?
Sonia : Because I love him.
UNK: Stop, Javi. Javi! Javi! Stop!
Esposito : It's over, Sonia.
UNK: No.
Sonia : I won't go back. I can't.
Esposito : You can.
