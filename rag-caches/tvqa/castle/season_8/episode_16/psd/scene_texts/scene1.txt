Beckett : In fact, I am due for a meeting with the DA.
UNK: So, why don't you meet up with the boys?
Beckett : We can debrief later.
Castle : You got it.
UNK: Um, Lucy, do you think you could make me a cup of coffee?
UNK: A splash of low-fat milk, two Splendas?
UNK: No can do. AlloutofSplenda.
Lucy : But there is a Starbucks two blocks from here.
UNK: Wouldyou like directions?
Beckett : No, thanks. I know where it is.
Lucy : Great. Have fun. Good-bye. Leave the house.
UNK: Lanie, look who's here.
