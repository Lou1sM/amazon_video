UNK: Richard Castle : That wasn't me.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Says the guy with the razor-sharp French toast
UNK: and a sausage kabob.
Castle : Okay, that was me. But that balloon had it coming.
Castle : To you, my love, my heart, my bride.
Castle : Welcome back to our home.
Beckett : Oh, that is so sweet, Castle.
UNK: But how is this really a welcome back
Beckett : if I've been sneaking into your room almost every night?
UNK: Well, because you've officially moved all your stuff back in.
Castle : Now that we've agreed to hunt LokSat together,
Castle : we can simply pick up exactly where we left off.
Beckett : And as I recall, we left off this morning somewhere right about here.
Castle : Lucy, music off.
Lucy : As you wish, Rick.
Beckett : What just happened?
UNK: I've integrated Lucy into all the loft's infrastructure.
Castle : Climate, lights, music.
Castle : You name it, she controls it. Just got to work out a few of the kinks.
Beckett : Well, I still like a few things the old-fashioned way.
Beckett : So, do you want me to make you a cup of coffee?
Lucy : Uh, no need, Kate.
Lucy : I've programmed Rick's coffee exactly to his liking.
UNK: Cuban blend, steamed milk, two sugars, pinch of nutmeg.
Castle : Amazing, huh?
Lucy : No, Rick, you're amazing.
Castle : No, you are.
Castle : No, you are.
Castle : - No, Lucy. You are. - Rick, you're amazing and you know it.
UNK: Beckett.
Castle : Stop it! I'm not doing this with you again.
Lucy : - You stop it. - Yeah. Got it.
Beckett : We have a homicide.
UNK: You, me, in a crime scene.
Castle : Just as nature intended.
UNK: AII right, Captain. Let's roll.
