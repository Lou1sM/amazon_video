Beckett : But then again, it's the least you could do,
Beckett : considering you're the one who crashed the car.
Linda : No, I didn't.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : You know what, it's coming back to me now,
Linda : I gave Robyn that scarf at the party.
Linda : As a gift.
Beckett : Look, Linda, I get it, you were scared.
UNK: Iffound out, you would be sent to prison,
Beckett : kicked out of law school.
Beckett : Your entire future would go up in flames. So you ran.
UNK: And you let Robyn take the fall.
Linda : You can't prove any of this.
Beckett : I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Beckett : I traced the call made to Officer O'Grady.
Beckett : It was from your phone.
UNK: I also spoke with your bank,
UNK: they found the $50,000 withdrawal used to pay him off.
Linda : I don't know what I was thinking.
Castle : I panicked.
UNK: Then after Robyn went to jail, I just...
Linda : I felt so guilty.
Beckett : Is that why you started NBP?
Castle : I thought
Linda : maybe I could help Robyn, somehow make a difference.
Beckett : Except she found out the truth,
UNK: confronted you, and that's why you killed her?
Linda : I didn't kill Robyn.
Linda : I didn't even know she found out the truth.
Beckett : Look, Linda, it's time to come clean.
Linda : I just did.
Linda : I crashed the car, fled the scene.
Linda : But I didn't kill Robyn.
Linda : I was in Philadelphia on business at the time of the murder.
Beckett : Who else knew about the crash?
Linda : I'd like to speak to my lawyer now.
UNK: AII groups, final checks. Ten minutes until curtain.
Martha : Oh, Richard, thank you for letting me be here.
Castle : Of course, Mother. You should be here.
