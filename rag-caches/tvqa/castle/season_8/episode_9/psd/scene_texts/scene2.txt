Castle : While I do what?
Beckett : Provide support and comfort.
UNK: Lots and lots of comfort.
UNK: Bye.
UNK: Ah.
Castle : Mother! How's your day going?
UNK: Mother!
Martha : Oh, Richard, darling, thank God you're here.

Martha : It's poor, sweet Robyn that we should be thinking about.
Castle : - You knew her? - Oh, I just met her yesterday.
