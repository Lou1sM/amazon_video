UNK: I don't know what you're talking about.
Esposito : What about the name Robyn King?
Esposito : Does that ring a bell?
Mama : Sure. what of it?
Esposito : She did two years in prison for you.
UNK: You probably thought the $40 a month
Castle : you put in her prison commissary account would keep her loyal.
Esposito : But I'm thinking it didn't.
Esposito : That's why you stopped by the theater,
Esposito : to lay down a little old-fashioned motherly guilt.
UNK: Or was it to strong-arm her back onto your crew?
Mama : I went there to check on her. Make sure she was okay.
Esposito : We got a witness that says you were angry when you showed up.
Mama : What can I say? She hurt my feelings.
Castle : Yeah. Kids. They don't call, they don't write.
Mama : Tell me about it.
