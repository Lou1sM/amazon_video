UNK: Sheep-eared.
Castle : - Shepherd. - Exactly.
Martha : - And the bull? - Stubborn?
Castle : Wall Street. That's not in Spanish Harlem.
Martha : Bull is the astrological sign for Taurus.
UNK: It is. Does that help us?
Alexis : We'll put a pin in that. Next are the bag and the ball.
UNK: Oh. And notjust any bag, that is a shopping bag.
Castle : An item with which you are intimately familiar.
Alexis : So, shopping ball?
UNK: No, mall. Shopping mall.
Castle : Wait a minute.
Castle : Midnight, by the river, at the Shephard Torres shopping mall!
UNK: Oh...
Castle : well done. Let's go.
Alexis : Wait, wait. Shouldn't we call the cops?
Martha : Yeah, it's a kind of dangerous neighborhood.
UNK: Ladies,
Castle : with all the gentrification going on,
Castle : there's no such thing as bad river-front property.
Castle : Okay. Maybe I was wrong.
Castle : Watch your step.
UNK: Maybe we should be texting Espo and Ryan.
Alexis : I already called them. They're on their way.
Castle : I don't know whether to be happy or hurt by your lack offaith in me.
UNK: I'm gonna go with happy.
Alexis : - Was that a rat? - No, it's too big to be a rat.
