Robyn : That crash was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Robyn : Because in prison, I got clean,
Robyn : Hooked up with the NBP,
UNK: and itsaved my life.
Narrator : Ladies and gentlemen, the Aca-Cons!
Castle : Why would Robyn be so interested in this?
UNK: Hey.
Ryan : I managed to track down that cab that Robyn jumped into
Ryan : after she got the DVD from Dr. Larson.
Ryan : - Where'd she go? - Townhouse on the Upper East Side.
Esposito : And look who lives there.
Castle : That cannot be a coincidence.
UNK: So...
Beckett : You saw Robyn the night that she was murdered?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: It's kind of eerie ifyou think about it?
Beckett : Yeah. I mean, why would she visit?
Percy : She wanted to thank me personally.
Percy : You see, Robyn was unconscious when I saved her.
Percy : And then after she recovered,
Percy : she went straight to prison, so we never actually properly met.
Beckett : Percy, you are a real hero.
Percy : No, you're the heroes.
Percy : I was just in the right place at the right time.
UNK: Mmm-mmm. No, don't be so modest.
Beckett : If you didn't make a tourniquet out of that scarf,
UNK: Robyn could've bled out and died.
Beckett : Speaking of that scarf, where did it come from?
UNK: Uh... Robyn was wearing it.
Martha : - She was? - Mmm-hmm.
Beckett : Oh. That's funny.
Beckett : Because we reached out to the hospital where Robyn was taken,
Beckett : and on her intake form,
UNK: there was a bit of a fashion discrepancy.
Beckett : You see, Robyn's entire outfit was worth about $50.
Beckett : and that was worth about two grand.
Beckett : So, what I'm wondering is,
Beckett : why are you lying to me?
UNK: Okay.
Percy : Can you keep a secret?
Beckett : No, but you're going to tell me anyway.
