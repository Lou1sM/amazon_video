UNK: So, Captain Beckett,
UNK: Richard Castle : have you successfully completed your agenda for your lunch meeting?
Beckett : - Indeed, I did. Three times. - Three?
Castle : Best meeting ever.
Beckett : Who would have thought that secret dating would be so productive?
Castle : I know, our public fights have made our private time so much more...
Beckett : - Intense. - Right?
UNK: Yes.
