Mama : You think they'd show a little gratitude
Mama : instead of dumping you for a new family.
Esposito : Is that why you killed her?
Esposito : 'Cause she started running with that other crew?
Mama : I didn't kill her, Detective. I went there, I said my piece, I left.
Mama : And I can prove it.
Castle : This new family,
Castle : they wouldn't happen to live in Spanish Harlem, would they?
Mama : Hell if I know.
Mama : Robyn said she hooked up with them in prison.
Mama : And that they had a "big thing" coming up.
Castle : - Hey. - Hey.
Beckett : How'd it go with Mama?
UNK: Oh, her alibi checks out.
UNK: She was in a cab by 8 : 15.
UNK: And it looks as though Robyn was working with a new crew.
Beckett : I had a really great time earlier.
Castle : Me, too.
Beckett : Is it wrong that I want to kiss you right now?
Castle : So wrong, it's right.
Beckett : - I'm sorry. - For what?
Beckett : You're a jerk!
Esposito : Hey, bro. You okay?
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : No. Ow, man, she hits hard.
Ryan : Look, Castle, it's clearly not okay, you being here.
Esposito : Yeah, you better go home. We'll call you ifwe find anything.
