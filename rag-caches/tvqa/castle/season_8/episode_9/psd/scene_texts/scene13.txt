Charisse : But Agnes, she's a repeat offender.
Charisse : And she's not interested in changing.
Castle : So, rather than take a chance before your big break...
Charisse : we kicked her out.
Charisse : We all voted, but Robyn was the one who told her.
Charisse : Agnes was pissed,
Charisse : accused Robyn of stabbing her in the back.
UNK: Agnes Molina, three-time loser with a long list of priors,
UNK: that's including B&E and assault.
Ryan : Looks like we can add murder to that list.
UNK: Yeah, we ran her prints against the ones we found at the theater,
UNK: we got a match.
Beckett : And where is she now?
Esposito : She's in the wind.
Ryan : Agnes didn't check in with her parole officer yesterday.
Esposito : Unis searched her apartment. Looks like our girl packed up and left.
Beckett : Well, someone's gotta have a lead on where she's hiding.
Esposito : That's what we figured.
Ryan : Yeah. So we asked the couple that runs the NBP to come in,
Ryan : Scott and Linda weinberg.
UNK: AII right, I'll talk to them. You guys dig into Agnes' Iife.
Beckett : See what you can find.
UNK: Linda Weinberg : We started this organization when we were both young lawyers
UNK: Iooking to give back,
UNK: Linda Weinberg : and the difference we made for these girls was so profound
UNK: Linda Weinberg : that we dedicated our lives to helping them.
Beckett : So, how well do you know Agnes Molina?
Linda : Why? Is she a suspect?
UNK: Uh, yeah, she is.
UNK: Scott Weinberg : Captain, Agnes certainly did some bad things in her life,
UNK: but she's a sweet kid, not a killer.
Castle : Do you have any idea where she is now?
Scott : No. I mean, her parents shut her out after the last arrest.
Beckett : And what about friends?
Linda : In jail, yes.
Linda : But on the outside...
Scott : Just the girls in the group.
UNK: There's got to be somebody else.
