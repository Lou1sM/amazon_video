Castle : I don't suppose the Captain has time for one more agenda?
Beckett : I'm sorry, I wish I could,
Beckett : but I have to make this meeting with Captain Gates at 1 PP.
UNK: And is "Gates" code for Vikram? And 1 PP your secret strip-club hideout?
Beckett : No, that meeting with Gates is very real.
Beckett : Look, Rick, I'm done playing lone wolf.
Beckett : And I promise you, when the time is right,
Beckett : I will loop you in on everything LokSat.
Castle : I mean, I get that the whole thing is a covert op,
Castle : I'm just saying,
Castle : I could be your secret weapon in taking LokSat down.
UNK: Trust me, 007, when it's time,
Beckett : you and I will take down LokSat together.
