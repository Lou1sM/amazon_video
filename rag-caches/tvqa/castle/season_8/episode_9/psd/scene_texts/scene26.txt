Esposito : ran off, leaving Robyn to take the fall.
Castle : But not before bandaging Robyn's leg with their own scarf.
Esposito : So, if Robyn found out who that scarf belonged to and then confronted them...
Castle : There's a good chance that person is our killer.
Ryan : Hey, guys, I talked to the country club
Ryan : and I think I found the woman who threw that party.
Ryan : Her name is Chloe Jarvis.
UNK: And apparently she's like the Paris Hilton of Long Island.
Castle : You say that like it's a good thing.
Esposito : Yeah, but that party was years ago.
UNK: How are we gonna find out who was wearing the scarf?
UNK: Photos.
Ryan : Because Chloe has a Snappamatic account.
Castle : Smart thinking.
Castle : Hopefully the photos of that party are still up.
UNK: Damn, Chloe's account is private.
Ryan : And we don't have enough probable cause yet
Ryan : to justify a warrant.
Castle : Excuse me, the NYPD may need probable cause.
Castle : Richard Castle Investigations, however...
Esposito : No, Castle. You cannot
Esposito : hack Chloe's account on behalf of the NYPD.
Ryan : We absolutely forbid you.
Castle : Honestly, how did you guys ever solve murders without me?
UNK: AII the time.
Beckett : Hey, where's Castle going?
Esposito : You don't want to know.
Esposito : 'Cause Beckett, you don't need him.
Ryan : And look, just so you know,
Ryan : - you get us in the breakup, okay? - Damn straight.
UNK: Anyway...
Beckett : I was looking over Robyn's arrest reports
Beckett : from the Suffolk County PD. It's pretty thin.
Beckett : But apparently the evidence box in their property room is missing.
Beckett : Which means either they're practicing really shoddy police work...
