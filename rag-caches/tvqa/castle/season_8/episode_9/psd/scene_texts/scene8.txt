Martha : You're right. The bubbles, very soothing.
Castle : Mother, what are you doing here? You should be at home, resting.
Martha : Please, how can I possibly rest? There's a murderer to catch.
UNK: Listen, I have to warn you,
Castle : we found evidence that Robyn may have returned to a life of crime.
Martha : Nonsense. That girl has a good heart.
Martha : I know she was trying to turn her life around.
Martha : So, let's get to work. What can I do to help?
UNK: AII right, we know that Robyn was meeting with her new crew
Castle : twice a week in Spanish Harlem.
Castle : And I think these symbols on her phone
Castle : have something to do with her next meeting.
Alexis : So, what's the problem?
Castle : I don't speak emoji.
Castle : I think that first symbol, there, the button-y thing, is a clock, obviously.
Martha : And the hands are on 12. So Robyn's crew is meeting at noon.
Castle : Not noon. Midnight.
Castle : So, that gives us less than an hour to figure this out and get uptown.
