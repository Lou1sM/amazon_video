Ryan : Or somebody helped our mystery driver to frame Robyn.
UNK: Exactly.
Beckett : The arresting officer's name is Dan O'Grady.
UNK: He just retired from the job and moved to Manhattan.
Ryan : Kind of cushy for a cop on a pension, huh?
Castle : - It is. - AII right. Bring him in.
UNK: I don't know what to tell you, Captain. The evidence must've been misplaced.
UNK: Call the desk sergeant.
Beckett : No, evidence is missing.
Beckett : So, what did you do with it?
UNK: Who do you think you are, lady?
UNK: I came here as a courtesy, and you're gonna accuse me of misconduct?
UNK: I'm not accusing you of anything.
Beckett : Your own bank account is.
Beckett : A week after Robyn took a plea deal, you made five deposits,
Beckett : $9,900 each, over five days.
UNK: I don't have to listen to this.
Beckett : The moment you leave this office, I will be calling Internal Affairs.
Beckett : What do you want me to tell them?
Beckett : That you were helpful in solving Robyn's homicide,
Beckett : or that you obstructed justice? It's your call.
UNK: Look.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : You, um...
UNK: You gotta understand,
UNK: I was four months away from mandatory retirement.
UNK: My bank account was a joke. I was desperate.
UNK: A day after Robyn was arrested, I got a phone call from some woman.
