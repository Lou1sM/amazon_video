UNK: Um, if Agnes was in trouble, who would she go to?
Linda : There was an ex-boyfriend. He visited her in prison once.
Ryan : Ex-boyfriend's name is Dexter Grimes. He's an unemployed welder and ex-con.
Castle : Sounds like a real catch.
Castle : And, gentlemen, as I told you, Beckett is fine with me riding along.
UNK: Oh, yeah. She's fine with it.
Ryan : I believe her exact words were,
UNK: "Sure. Maybe we'll get lucky and Castle will get shot."
Castle : Really? Ouch.
Esposito : What did you do?
Ryan : - Nothing. - You got slapped, Castle.
Ryan : You definitely did something.
Esposito : Or someone.
Esposito : You cheated?
Castle : What? No.
UNK: Castle, don't you lie to us.
Ryan : Beckett's our family. You cheat on her, you cheat on us.
Esposito : What's her name?
Castle : Guys, I'm telling you the truth.
Castle : - That's my skin. - What is her name?
Castle : - Svetlana. - Svetlana?
UNK: Svetlana.
Ryan : What is she, some kind of Russian underwear model?
Percy : Uh, yeah?
UNK: Dexter Grimes : - What the hell are you doing? - NYPD.
Esposito : We're coming in.
UNK: Ow...
Ryan : So, Dexter Grimes.
Ryan : When was the last time you saw Agnes Molina?
Dexter : Agnes? Haven't seen her in years.
Dexter : Before she got busted.
Esposito : Nice try, Dex.
Esposito : We know that you visited her in prison.
Ryan : And now she's on the run.
Ryan : You're such a catch, we figured she came running to you.
Dexter : I'm telling you, me and her are done. I got no idea where she is.
Castle : Is that right? So, then this lipstick is from...
Dexter : My mom.
Castle : I suppose
Castle : this is your mom's bra?
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : Fat chance.
UNK: Matter offact, Dexter, I believe Agnes is hiding
Castle : right here.
Castle : Almost had me.
UNK: Too bad I know she's under here!
UNK: Who piles clothes under that...
Castle : Getting a little nervous, Dex?
Castle : Am I getting
UNK: warmer?
UNK: Seriously?
Castle : Behind the...
Castle : I was right there.
UNK: Well...
UNK: Yes. Hi.
Castle : Believe this is yours.
Ryan : We know you were at the theater, Agnes.
Ryan : We found your prints.
UNK: Agnes Molina : Why do you think I ran?
UNK: Agnes Molina : Second I heard Robyn was dead, I knew you'd pin it on me.
Esposito : So you're saying you didn't kill Robyn?
