UNK: Yes!
UNK: Kate Beckett : Wow. I haven't seen you this excited since...
UNK: Kate Beckett : Uh, well, earlier this morning, so...
Castle : You know what this is, Beckett?
UNK: Uh, no, but I know that a very secure messenger just brought it in.
UNK: Oh, my. It's absolutely beautiful.
Beckett : What is it?
Castle : The YOLO card.
UNK: Like, "Dude, I just drove my mom's car into the river. #YOLO"?
Castle : No, no, no.
UNK: This work of art will forever release YOLO from Internet jail.
Castle : You see, each card
Castle : was painstakingly handcrafted by an international team of artisans.
Castle : Note the flecks of actual black diamond embedded in the card,
Castle : the state-of-the-art radio-frequency ID chip.
Castle : The best part, only 10,000 people in the world
