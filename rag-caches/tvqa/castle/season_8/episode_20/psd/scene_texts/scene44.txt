Castle : To get him to lead you to your brother.
UNK: That way you could kill EI Oso and take over the family business.
Castle : Much in the same way you took over the family bed.
Beckett : And when Zane couldn't get a second meeting with EI Oso,
Beckett : he was a loose end. So you killed him.
Hector : I did not kill Zane.
Beckett : We know that Zane called you
Beckett : from a burner phone hours before he was killed.
Beckett : We also know that you put $15 million into a holding account.
Castle : The exact amount of his tax bill.
Hector : Let's say I did have a deal with him.
