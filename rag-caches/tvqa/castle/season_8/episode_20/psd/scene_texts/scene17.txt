UNK: Yeah, I can't come up with stuff like that.
UNK: Yo! Just heard back from that limo driver
Esposito : that Zane hired the morning of his murder.
Esposito : You'll never believe where he went. Sing Sing Penitentiary.
Beckett : Why did he go there?
UNK: To pick up a newly-released inmate, Johnny Toro,
Esposito : who also happens to be his estranged older stepbrother.
Beckett : How did we not know that Zane had a stepbrother?
Esposito : Different dads, different names.
Esposito : And according to Zane's publicist, he kept it quiet.
UNK: He didn't wanna be associated with this guy.
Ryan : - Then why'd he show up at the prison? - I don't know.
Esposito : According to the limo driver, though, it was far from a happy family reunion.
