UNK: Said he will set me up for the rest of my life.
Toro : Just had to get his financial problems figured out.
Ryan : What financial problems? Zane had $10 million in the bank.
Toro : He owed the IRS 15 mil in back taxes.
Toro : He was gonna be broke in, like, two months.
Ryan : Then why'd he walk away from an $8 million payday
UNK: and that Safe Word movie to go do Shakespeare?
Toro : He said he had a plan to get paid. It was something big, man.
Esposito : Sounds like whatever money-making scheme Zane was involved in
UNK: was probably what got him killed.
Esposito : Only question is... what the hell are you doing, Kev?
UNK: Yeah. I figured it out.
Esposito : - What he was involved in? - No! No, no, no, no.
Ryan : The, uh, new choreography for Sara Grace's preschool play.
Esposito : Oh, good. why don't you keep working on that while I solve our homicide?
UNK: Let me get a plain hotdog.
Ryan : - Hey, Javi. - Yeah.
Ryan : We are being filmed.
UNK: That's our stalkerazzi I chased off the crime scene.
Ryan : Hey, buddy, what's your name?
Stalkerazzi : This is a public street. I have the right to film you.
UNK: No, cool, cool, cool.
UNK: We just wanna know why you're filming us.
Stalkerazzi : Well, I want the same thing you guys do,
Stalkerazzi : an ending to Zane Cannon's story.
Martha : Wait a minute.
UNK: Have you been tracking our investigation by tracking us?
Stalkerazzi : ever since he dropped out of the movie Safe Word to play Hamlet.
Stalkerazzi : I knew that pretty boy was a train wreck waiting to happen.
