Ryan : You've been following Zane?
Stalkerazzi : On and off, ever since he got to New York a month ago.
Esposito : So did you see him on the night of his murder?
Ryan : Look, come on, you want an ending to your story?
Ryan : Why don't you show us what you got and maybe we can do you a favor.
Stalkerazzi : Yeah, I don't work for favors. I want an interview with the killer.
Ryan : Yeah, and I want a baby unicorn with a rainbow tail.
Ryan : For my daughter.
