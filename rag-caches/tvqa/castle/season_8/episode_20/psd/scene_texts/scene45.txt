Hector : Why would I kill him a week before Hamlet previews?
Hector : According to you,
UNK: good reviews would've gotten him another meeting with my brother.
Beckett : But that would have put Zane out in the cold
Beckett : for his Oscar-winning role.
Beckett : And even with a big payoff,
Beckett : it would have been tough to get him to walk away from that role.
Castle : Unless you promised him he could keep it anyway.
Castle : With your brother dead, the life rights would revert to you.
UNK: I could care less about the EI Oso biopic.
Hector : I told him he could direct it, for all I cared.
Castle : Wait, you...
Castle : You told Zane he could star in and direct his dream project?
Hector : Only, I guess, Zane had already promised the job to someone else.
Hector : Someone who would not be happy to lose it.
