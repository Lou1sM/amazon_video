Esposito : But we do have a lead on this mystery woman that Zane was seeing.
Esposito : His financials came in.
Esposito : They say that he rented a limo yesterday morning.
Castle : Which makes sense, since Naomi trashed his DB9.
Beckett : And where was this limo going?
Esposito : I don't know yet. I'm still waiting for the driver to call me back.
Esposito : But hopefully he knows who this woman is.
Ryan : I have already found her.
Ryan : It turns out that Zane was renting a suite
Ryan : at the Black Door hotel under a fake name.
Castle : - Ah! The Black Door. Yes, very fancy. - Mmm-hmm.
