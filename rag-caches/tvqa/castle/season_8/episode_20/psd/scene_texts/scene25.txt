UNK: Hey, Javi, I'll bet your old army buddy
Ryan : could get his brother transferred closer to the city.
Ryan : Make those visits a little easier on Mama.
Esposito : Yeah, but he'd have to be willing to talk.
Castle : - Oh. - I don't make deals with police.
Esposito : Oh, that's fine.
Esposito : My buddy also tells me
Esposito : that there's a bunch of openings at a federal penitentiary in Georgia.

Castle : At least.
Ryan : Kind of rough on Mama.
UNK: AII right. I'll talk about Zane.
