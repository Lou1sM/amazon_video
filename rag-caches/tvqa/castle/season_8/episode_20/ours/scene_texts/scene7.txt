UNK: Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, Jorge, wait, wait, wait!
Castle : You remember how Richard III ended?
Castle : You could write your own ending here!
Zamacona : An artist must be true to the material. And himself!
Zamacona : Open the hatch.
UNK: They're over there.
Man : He's down. He's down.
Man : Three down.
Man : Castle's here.
Man : - Are you hurt, Mr. Castle? - No, I'm fine. I'm fine, I...
Castle : But I may not be for long.
Castle : It was just instinct. He was running by and I tripped him.
Ryan : You did good, Castle.
UNK: No! Not good, I... Not good at all. I tripped a drug lord.
Castle : It's my fault he got caught.
Beckett : The DEA had the building surrounded.
UNK: EI Oso wasn't getting away even ifyou didn't trip him.
Ryan : Sadly, despite your abduction being a fantastic story,
Ryan : we're still no closer to finding out who killed Zane.
Esposito : I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Esposito : The DEA confiscated a dozen burner phones from EI Oso's barn.
UNK: One of those phones is the one he used to call Zane the day he was killed.
Beckett : So they have Zane's burner phone number.
UNK: Which means we could find out if he called anyone else.
Esposito : We can, and he did, an international line in Mexico.
Esposito : And you won't believe who it belongs to.
UNK: EI Oso's younger brother, Hector Zamacona.
Esposito : A legit businessman
UNK: who publicly condemns EI Oso every chance he gets.
Ryan : If he's in Mexico, how did Zane connect with him?
Esposito : Both ends of that call from Zane's phone
UNK: pinged off oftowers here in the city. Baby bro's in town.
Beckett : - Do we know where he is now? - Not yet.
