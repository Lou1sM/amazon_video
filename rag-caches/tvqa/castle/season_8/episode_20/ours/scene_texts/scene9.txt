Erin : Hamlet betrayed you.
Erin : He never loved you. "Get thee to a nunnery," right?
Erin : Hamlet took everything from you.
Castle : That's certainly a scene you can relate to, isn't it, Ms. Cherloff?
Erin : Uh, this is a private rehearsal. We have a break in 20.
Erin : Can you let us finish?
Ryan : I think maybe you are finished.
UNK: AII due respect to the Bard,
Castle : we're here with a tale of our own, one with betrayal and jealousy,
Castle : though sadly classic.
Esposito : A truly gifted director watches
Esposito : as her former classmate's star rises in Hollywood,
Esposito : while she fought like hell for every opportunity.
Erin : I love what I do.
UNK: So what ifZane made millions
Erin : because he chose the gym over acting school?
Erin : I make art.
Castle : But when Zane asked you to cast him as Hamlet, you told him no, didn't you?
Erin : Yes, until he convinced me he was right for the part.
Ryan : By offering you your big break, directing the EI Oso biopic.
Castle : But it was a Hollywood promise. Not worth a damn.
Castle : Tell me, did he confess to you
Castle : that he would be directing the picture on his own,
Castle : or did he just tell you, you lost the job?
Erin : - Neither. - Because it didn't happen.
Erin : I don't know anything about an EI Oso project.
Esposito : Then how do you explain the browser history on your laptop?
Ryan : Or the shoes in your closet with Zane's blood on them?
Erin : You have no idea what a risk it was putting Zane in this play.
Erin : And the only thing that made it worthwhile was directing that movie.
Erin : And then he tells me that he's gonna do it?
