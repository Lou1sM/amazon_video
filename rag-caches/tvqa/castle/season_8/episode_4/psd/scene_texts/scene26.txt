Castle : Midnight Run. It's one of the top five buddy movies of all time.
Ryan : And you're suggesting we base our legal strategy
UNK: upon this buddy cop movie?
Beckett : No, he's right. It could work.
Beckett : At the end of the movie,
UNK: Robert De Niro tricks a mobster into taking computer disks
Beckett : he thinks contain evidence against him.
Beckett : And just by showing up to take them,
Beckett : the mobster is committing conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Castle : If we can trick Reed the same way,
Castle : then we've got all the leverage we need to expose the slush fund
Castle : And go after him for Dave's murder.
UNK: But, Kate, you can't be involved.
Beckett : Why not?
Ryan : Because if Reed isn't involved,
UNK: then all this blows up in our face, and you take the hit.
UNK: And you don't need that.
UNK: Let us shieldyou, Captain.
Beckett : Okay. I'm out. For now.
UNK: Thanks.
Ryan : Okay, how do we do this?
