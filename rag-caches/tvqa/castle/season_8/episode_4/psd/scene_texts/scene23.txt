Arguello : I simply asked Dave to sneak into the accounting office
Arguello : and log the payment into the computer as received.
Beckett : Oh. So, this wasn't about making amends, this was about helping you.
Arguello : When Dave was hacked into the city budget,
Arguello : he found evidence of a secret slush fund.
UNK: $10 million siphoned from social programs
Arguello : to line someone's pocket.
Arguello : It was a lie Dave couldn't stomach.
Arguello : So, he vowed to expose it.
UNK: And you believe that whoever controlled this alleged slush fund
Beckett : discovered Dave's intrusion?
