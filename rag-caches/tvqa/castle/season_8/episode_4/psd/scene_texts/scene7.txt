UNK: Okay, bye-bye.
Beckett : So, I just got off the phone with P.J. Moffet's publisher.
Beckett : Our author is still very much alive.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Dave Johnson was lying about who he was.
Ryan : Yeah, we figured.
Ryan : So, Dave tells Milton that he's Jimmy "Two Guns" O'Malley,
Ryan : and then Milton rats him out to the Irish mob.
UNK: Maybe our vic was a con man.
Beckett : And conning the wrong guy got him killed.
Esposito : Captain Beckett?
Beckett : Hey. You heard back from the FBI?
Ryan : Yeah, it's looking more and more like
Ryan : the Irish mob are responsible for Dave's murder.
Ryan : Meet Billy O'Rourke,
UNK: a suspected hitman from Southie.
Ryan : Word on the street is he landed at JFK yesterday afternoon.
Beckett : Is he still in town?
UNK: Well, as oftwo minutes ago, he hadn't checked out of the Biltmore Hotel.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : Go find Espo and pick him up.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : - Ryan? - Hmm?
Beckett : Be careful.
Ryan : You got it.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: One, two...
Esposito : Is he in there?
UNK: AII right. Thanks. Get out of here, kid.
Castle : So, she's telling me she needs space.
UNK: I'm saying that that's a cry for help.
UNK: Well, Ricky, I completely agree.
Castle : Thank you.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
UNK: NYPD!
Castle : Hey, guys! How are... Are you hungry?
UNK: Oh, sorry,
UNK: neither of us ordered pigs wrapped in Kevlar. Get out.
Ryan : On your feet right now, O'Rourke.
UNK: Castle, how did you get here?
Castle : When I gave Dave's wife a ride home,
Castle : I saw a receipt from yesterday,
Castle : a rush dry cleaning job on Dave's jacket.
Castle : The bill was charged to this room. How did you get here?
Beckett : The FBI.
Ryan : Castle, this guy, he's a hitman for the Irish mob.
Castle : No. well, yes. Yes.
Castle : But when you get to know him, he's actually really a lovely person.
Castle : You know, he's a good listener.
Castle : - I am. - Thank you for that.
Castle : - Very hospitable... - There you go.
Castle : And he actually told me that Dave...
UNK: Ricky, they're cops.
UNK: Shut up.
UNK: No, they're my cops, though. These guys are okay. Just...
Castle : Guys, Billy's not your killer.
Ryan : Oh. You know this how?
Castle : Billy told me.
UNK: Oh. Yeah.
UNK: And did he also cross his heart and hope to die?
Castle : Billy, tell them what you told me.
Beckett : Okay. Let's say, uh...
Castle : - Hypothetically... - Hypothetically.
UNK: I came to town to whack Jimmy "Two Guns."
UNK: And, hypothetically, I threw him in the trunk of my rental
UNK: and drove him out to the marsh by the Meadowlands.
Castle : You know where that is.
UNK: - Onlyjust before, hypothetically... - Of course.
UNK: I could put a bullet through his brain,
UNK: I realize the guy doesn't look anything Iike Jimmy "Two Guns."
Castle : Right? So, Dave explains
Castle : it's all just a misunderstanding,
Castle : that he's actually P.J. Moffet.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : And he's telling everybody he's Jimmy "Two Guns"
Castle : so he can do research for his new novel.
UNK: Yeah, I'm a huge fan.
Castle : The Butcherbird's Song, it's my everything.
UNK: - Please, that's... I have a copy myself. - Hey, hey, hey!
Castle : No, no. So, Billy brings Dave back here, and he pays to have his jacket cleaned.
UNK: Yeah. He even autographed the book for me.
UNK: Uh-huh? Ah. Oh. Isn't that lovely?
UNK: Uh. Hate to burst your bubble, though.
Ryan : He ended up not being P.J. Moffet after all.
UNK: Guy was a con man.
Castle : - Come on! - What? No!
Esposito : And, by the way, Castle, no matter what you say here,
Esposito : it doesn't prove that your new BFF Billy didn't off Dave.
Castle : - No, it doesn't, but his alibi does. - Yeah.
Castle : At the time of the murder, he was front row at The Lion King.
UNK: Arguably the best musical in town.
Castle : Yes, well, you're not wrong.
Castle : But tell them what you saw before you put Dave in the trunk.
Castle : - Hypothetically. - Hypothetically.
UNK: Yeah, before I snatched up Dave,
UNK: I saw him having this knock-down, drag-out argument
UNK: with some tall guy outside his apartment house.
