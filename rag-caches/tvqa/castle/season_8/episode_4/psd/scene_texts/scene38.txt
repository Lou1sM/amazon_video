UNK: It's 'cause I lied.
UNK: There's a, uh, special ingredient.
Castle : I kept it a secret.
Beckett : Really? what is it?
UNK: Well, now, if I told you that, you might not need me anymore.
Beckett : Then don't tell me.
Beckett : And since we're being honest, there's something that I have to tell you.
UNK: I hated Moffet's book.
Castle : What? why...
Castle : why didn't you tell me?
Beckett : Because you gave it to me when we first started dating,
Beckett : and I knew it was important to you,
UNK: so I lied.
Beckett : I'm sorry. I have to get this.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Have a good night.
Esposito : You, too.
Beckett : Vikram, hey.
Beckett : Did you get the test results on the heroin
Beckett : from the Vulcan Simmons case?
Beckett : Good. Now we can get to work.
