Beckett : Thank you. That's all I needed.
UNK: - What's up, Carl? - Hey.
Esposito : Hey, what are you meeting with CSU's narcotics guy for?
Beckett : You know, Espo, I do have other cases that I have to supervise.
Beckett : So, any luck on finding that mystery man?
Esposito : Ryan's scrubbing street cam footage near David's apartment.
UNK: But, yo, I think we're missing something here.
Beckett : What do you mean?
Esposito : Well, if Dave was a scam artist, he is the oddest one I ever heard of.
Esposito : I mean, yes, he was exhibiting con man behavior,
Esposito : but to what end?
UNK: Uh. To rip people off.
