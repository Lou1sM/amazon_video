Ryan : What is this, an AA meeting?
UNK: PLA.
UNK: What the hell is PLA?
Castle : Pathological Liars Anonymous.
Castle : Makes perfect sense.
UNK: Dave wasn't a con man. He was a pathological liar.
Eric : This is ridiculous.
Eric : I didn't kill Dave. He was my friend.
Ryan : You sure about that?
Ryan : Because the day he was killed, a witness saw you threatening him.
Eric : I was his sponsor.
Eric : He was in trouble.
Eric : I was pushing him to attend a Pathological Liars Anonymous meeting.
Esposito : Yeah, that's the ticket. That's it.
Alexis : - Remember? - Yeah.
Eric : How dare you, sir?
Eric : Compulsive and pathological lying is a mental disorder
Eric : caused by psychological trauma.
Eric : This is not something to joke around about.
Esposito : Okay, fine.
Esposito : But then how can we believe anything you say about Dave?
Esposito : You're a self-confessed liar.
Eric : I'm reformed. I took a vow of honesty, a pledge to refrain from lying.
Castle : Come on.
Castle : - Everybody lies. - Not me.
Eric : Not anymore.
Castle : Not even a little fib?
UNK: Martha Rodgers : - No. - A white lie?
Eric : No. I can prove it to you.
Eric : Ask me what I think about your writing.
Castle : What do you think of my writing?
Eric : I think you're a Patterson wannabe,
Eric : and I think your last book was a boring retread.
Eric : You see? Brutal truth.
Ryan : No, that's just being mean.
Eric : No, honest. Unlike you,
Eric : a man who obviously wears lifts so he can lie about his height.
Ryan : No, no. These aren't lifts.
Ryan : - These are custom prescription insoles. - Uh-huh.
Eric : What are you laughing about?
Eric : You clearly dye your hair so you can lie about your age.
UNK: It's just a little bit in the... In the temples.
Castle : Okay, look,
UNK: Iet's assume what you're saying is true.
Castle : You said Dave was in trouble. What kind oftrouble?
UNK: It started a couple ofweeks ago.
Eric : He fell off the wagon. He started lying out of control.
