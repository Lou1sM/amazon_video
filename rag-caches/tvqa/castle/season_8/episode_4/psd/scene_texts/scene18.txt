Martha : You know, we're friends with Beckett too.
Ryan : Plus, Beckett's our boss now. She doesn't want you working cases.
Castle : Guys, I love her. Okay? And I'm gonna get her back.
UNK: And the only way I know how to do that is by solving murders together.
Castle : So I'm not going anywhere. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
Castle : And try the tostadas.
Castle : They're wagyu beef.
Esposito : I do love me some Wagyu.
Castle : Thank you.
Castle : What's up?
UNK: Nothing. Jennyjust...
Ryan : You know, she wants me to pick up some stuff on the way home, that's all.
UNK: Really?

Ryan : Okay, I may have lied earlier.
Ryan : There was an exam slot open, but only one.
