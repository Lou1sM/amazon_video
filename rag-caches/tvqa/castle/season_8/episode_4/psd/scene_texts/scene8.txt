UNK: So, the guy says to Dave,
UNK: "Hey, you better come through Iike you promised,"
UNK: "or there's gonna be serious consequences."
Castle : Admit it, he's not so bad of a guy.
UNK: Ugh. Castle, just because his alibi held and he paid for lunch
Ryan : doesn't make him a great humanitarian.
Ryan : He kills people for a living.
Castle : Yes, but without people like him, people like us would be out of a job.
Castle : Now, what's our next move?
Castle : Locate and identify this mystery man?
Esposito : No, that's our next move.
Ryan : Your next move is to go home.
Ryan : Beckett doesn't want you working the case. I'm sorry.
UNK: No, I get it.
UNK: Totally understand. I'll circle back around and update my client.
Beckett : - Castle. - That's...
Castle : Yeah, that's too much.
Carl : Oh, Captain, my Captain!
UNK: Carl.
Beckett : Hey, thank you for coming up from CSU.
Beckett : I need you to give me a rundown of narcotic signatures.
Beckett : Specifically heroin.
Carl : Basically, every batch of heroin is like a snowflake.
Carl : No two are alike.
Carl : To determine if samples are from the same batch,
Carl : we run a chromatographic impurity signature profile analysis.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Okay. Um...
Beckett : Let's say I have a sample of heroin,
Beckett : and I compare it to another sample,
UNK: and that'll help me determine whether they originated from the same source?
UNK: Exactamundo.
