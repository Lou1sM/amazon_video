Arguello : Yes. But while he was there, Dave told me
Arguello : he stumbled across your little secret account.
UNK: I got no idea what you're talking about.
UNK: And my hotdog's waiting. So...
Arguello : Dave was a cautious man, Mr. Reed.
Arguello : He took proof of the account,
Arguello : proof that he left on a thumb drive on the altar of my church
Arguello : behind the chalice before he was killed.
Arguello : I give you this information as a gift.
