Castle : where you've moved your hidden slush fund.
Castle : It's the computer equivalent of an exploding dye pack.
UNK: Oops.
Castle : So I guess we can add destruction of city property to those charges.
UNK: Milton Cicero : I didn't kill him.
Stephen : Why would I? He was a liar.
Stephen : Plus, I have an alibi.
UNK: Oh. Let me guess. You were home alone, asleep.
UNK: No. I was out playing poker with your boss, the police commissioner.
Stephen : Which means your killer is still out there.
Beckett : So, what do we know?
UNK: Lanie Parish : Dave Johnson.
Castle : He was a pathological liar who stumbled upon
UNK: the secret slush funds and then decided to expose it.
Esposito : And everyone connected to that alibied out.
Beckett : So we've got nothing?
UNK: No.
Castle : We can safely assume that Dave was killed over a lie.
Beckett : Which lie, then?
Castle : Well, if I was writing this, I would fall back on the theme.
UNK: A lie is a betrayal oftrust.
UNK: And there is no greater betrayal than a lie in a marriage.
Beckett : Yeah, well, that might be. But wendy thought that Dave was P.J. Moffet.
Castle : What if she found out he wasn't?
Wendy : You have this all wrong.
Eric : I didn't kill Dave.
Beckett : We found fragments of stained glass in your car.
