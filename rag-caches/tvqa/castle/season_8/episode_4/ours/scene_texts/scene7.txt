Beckett : Good. That's all I needed.
UNK: AII right, well, thanks anyway for trying.
Ryan : Hey, bad news.
Ryan : There's no more slots open for the Sergeant's exam.
UNK: Damn! well, I guess we're gonna have to wait till the next slot opens up.
UNK: Bogey, three o'clock.
UNK: One, two, three.
Beckett : - NYPD! - Whoa!
UNK: Jeez!
UNK: Castle.
Castle : Hey. I was just going to that...
UNK: Just going to the bodega there. Pick something up.
UNK: A little Slim Jim, Yoo-hoo.
Ryan : Castle, how did you know that we were here?
Esposito : Did you put this tracker on me when you gave me that awkward hug?
Castle : I have no idea what that is.
UNK: But I'll take it offyour hands.
Esposito : Sure, here you go.
UNK: Oops.
Castle : You know I can find that, right?
Ryan : Hey, guys. It's Eric.
Bob : But I never really had a fair shot in life, you know?
Bob : My parents, they died in a plane crash when I was a kid.
Bob : That's a lie.
Bob : Actually, my parents live in Denver.
UNK: Cleveland.
UNK: Anyway, uh, my name's Steve. Thanks for listening.
Eric : Thanks, Bob.
Eric : Before we close, friends,
Eric : today is a sad day because we just lost one of our own.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Dave Johnson.
Eric : His is a cautionary tale because last night,
Eric : Dave's lies finally caught up with him.
Eric : Let's take a moment for Dave.
Ryan : What is this, an AA meeting?
UNK: PLA.
UNK: What the hell is PLA?
Castle : Pathological Liars Anonymous.
Castle : Makes perfect sense.
UNK: Dave wasn't a con man. He was a pathological liar.
Eric : This is ridiculous.
Eric : I didn't kill Dave. He was my friend.
Ryan : You sure about that?
Ryan : Because the day he was killed, a witness saw you threatening him.
Eric : I was his sponsor.
Eric : He was in trouble.
Eric : I was pushing him to attend a Pathological Liars Anonymous meeting.
Esposito : Yeah, that's the ticket. That's it.
Alexis : - Remember? - Yeah.
Eric : How dare you, sir?
Eric : Compulsive and pathological lying is a mental disorder
Eric : caused by psychological trauma.
Eric : This is not something to joke around about.
Esposito : Okay, fine.
Esposito : But then how can we believe anything you say about Dave?
Esposito : You're a self-confessed liar.
Eric : I'm reformed. I took a vow of honesty, a pledge to refrain from lying.
Castle : Come on.
Castle : - Everybody lies. - Not me.
Eric : Not anymore.
Castle : Not even a little fib?
UNK: Martha Rodgers : - No. - A white lie?
Eric : No. I can prove it to you.
Eric : Ask me what I think about your writing.
Castle : What do you think of my writing?
Eric : I think you're a Patterson wannabe,
Eric : and I think your last book was a boring retread.
Eric : You see? Brutal truth.
Ryan : No, that's just being mean.
Eric : No, honest. Unlike you,
Eric : a man who obviously wears lifts so he can lie about his height.
Ryan : No, no. These aren't lifts.
Ryan : - These are custom prescription insoles. - Uh-huh.
Eric : What are you laughing about?
Eric : You clearly dye your hair so you can lie about your age.
UNK: It's just a little bit in the... In the temples.
