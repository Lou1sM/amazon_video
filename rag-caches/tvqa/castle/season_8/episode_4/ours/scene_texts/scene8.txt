Castle : Okay, look,
UNK: Iet's assume what you're saying is true.
Castle : You said Dave was in trouble. What kind oftrouble?
UNK: It started a couple ofweeks ago.
Eric : He fell off the wagon. He started lying out of control.
UNK: And he was scared.
UNK: Scared ofwhat?
UNK: And he had uncovered something.
Eric : Something dangerous, illegal.
Esposito : Why didn't he come to the cops?
UNK: He had lied so many times to so many people.
Eric : Even his own wife.
UNK: He knew nobody would believe in him. He was the boy that cried wolf.
Eric : But whatever it was,
Eric : he said he needed proof before he could go public.
Beckett : Go public with what?
Ryan : He didn't know.
Beckett : And you think that the sponsor is telling the truth?
UNK: Well, as far as we can tell.
Esposito : Plus his alibi is rock-solid for the murder.
UNK: We gotta figure out what Dave was onto two weeks ago that got him killed.
Ryan : Already on it.
UNK: Greatjob, guys. I'll see you in the morning?
UNK: - AII right. - Thanks.
Ryan : Text from Castle.
Esposito : Yeah, me too.
UNK: - "My place. Important." - "My place. Important."
Ryan : Maybe he found something.
Esposito : What do we do?
Ryan : We go over to his place, we find out what's what.
Ryan : Whatever we do, we don't...
Esposito : Oh. Hell, no.
Esposito : But what if she finds out?
Ryan : - We lie our asses off. - Yeah.
Ryan : Do you hear something?
Esposito : No. I don't think so.
Castle : Hola, amigos.
Castle : Nice! Very nice!
UNK: Gentlemen, very nice. Grab a drink.
UNK: Uh. what is this?
Castle : This is just me saying thank you to my family at the 12th Precinct.
Ryan : - Oh. You're trying to buy our love. - What?
Esposito : So we'll help you win Beckett back.
UNK: No. Come on, guys. These are for you.
Esposito : Bro, you're putting us in a really tough spot here.
Martha : You know, we're friends with Beckett too.
Ryan : Plus, Beckett's our boss now. She doesn't want you working cases.
Castle : Guys, I love her. Okay? And I'm gonna get her back.
UNK: And the only way I know how to do that is by solving murders together.
Castle : So I'm not going anywhere. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.
Castle : And try the tostadas.
Castle : They're wagyu beef.
Esposito : I do love me some Wagyu.
Castle : Thank you.
Castle : What's up?
UNK: Nothing. Jennyjust...
Ryan : You know, she wants me to pick up some stuff on the way home, that's all.
UNK: Really?
Esposito : 'Cause that text message said "Sergeant's exam."
Ryan : Okay, I may have lied earlier.
Ryan : There was an exam slot open, but only one.
Esposito : So you took it?
Esposito : Without even talking to me?
Esposito : - Bro, that was my idea. - I'm sorry. I'm...
Ryan : You know how stressed out about money I've been lately.
Ryan : A bump in pay would really help.
Ryan : Javi. Hey!
Esposito : No. Save it.
UNK: Hey, Ryan.
Castle : I couldn't help but overhear about your financial concerns.
Castle : Maybe you and I could work together.
UNK: How?
UNK: Well, do a little moonlighting for me.
Castle : Just keep me in the loop as to what's going on at the 12th.
Ryan : You want me to be a rat for you? Hell, no.
UNK: I would pay you $500 a week.
Ryan : I'll do it.
Ryan : Hey, partner.
Ryan : Food truck is here.
Ryan : So I got you some breakfast. Double salsa.
Ryan : Just the way you like it.
Esposito : Oh. Hey, thanks.
Esposito : What the hell?
Esposito : I was just treating that burrito Iike you treated me.
UNK: Okay, I lied to you. I'm sorry. I have responsibilities.
Esposito : I guess looking out for your partner's back isn't one of them.
Beckett : You guys okay?
Esposito : Fine. what's up?
Beckett : I need you to go down to City Hall.
Beckett : Dave's boss said that Dave had an incident there two weeks ago.
Beckett : And his janitorial company was forced to reassign him to another facility.
Ryan : What kind of incident?
Esposito : I think that's what she's sending us down there to find out.
Ryan : Yeah, we're on it.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : What have you got for me?
Ryan : Yeah, apparently,
Ryan : our vic had some sort of confrontation down at City Hall.
Ryan : So we're running down there to talk to the deputy chief of staff.
UNK: Okay, yeah.
