UNK: Uh, I'm so sorry. I have no idea how that got on there.
Hayley : I do. Only the Castle who will be filling in isn't a mister.
Alexis : - It's me. - Really?
Castle : - Nice work. - Thanks.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Darling, I am so proud!
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Isn't she lovely? Okay, everyone, shall we dine? Follow me.
Castle : Ah, yes. And, everyone, we are so glad you were all able to join us.
Castle : Now, we celebrated your food earlier.
Castle : We think it's time for you guys to celebrate some American food.
Achmed : This is American food?
UNK: It's very international.
Martha : Exactly. And this country was founded by immigrants.
Martha : And it's those customs and cultures that have shaped and molded us.
Beckett : And you!
Martha : And you are the ones that make this country great.
Castle : Mother, I couldn't have said it better myself. Now let's dig in.
Martha : Yes, yes.
UNK: There's plates behind you there.
UNK: Mmm.
Beckett : What is it?
Castle : I wasn't in Korea.
Castle : I was in Koreatown in Los Angeles.
Castle : Beckett, I've got to go to L.A.
