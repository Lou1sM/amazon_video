UNK: What?
UNK: Agent Napier : Come on, Alonzo, drop the act.
UNK: Agent Napier : We know you came here for Eddie Ramirez.
UNK: Agent Napier : He killed your brother.
UNK: Agent Napier : And Judge Caldwell, he greased the wheels to get you up here.
Castle : Judge who?
Caldwell : I don't know what you're talking about, man.
Beckett : We tracked down the cab driver
Beckett : who picked you up from the airport and then took you to the zoo.
Beckett : We know you killed Eddie.
Alonzo : Eddie is dead?
Alonzo : That wasn't me.
Alonzo : Okay, the judge reached out to me.
Alonzo : And, yes, I went to the zoo to see Eddie, but I did not kill him.
UNK: Agent Napier : So what'd you come up here for then?
UNK: A little friendly chat? Maybe a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity?
Alonzo : I came here with revenge in my heart.
Alonzo : I thought that Eddie was responsible for my brother's death.
Alonzo : But I was wrong.
Alonzo : Eddie convinced me that he had been working with my brother in secret.
Alonzo : Protecting him.
Beckett : Eddie would tell you anything if he thought you were gonna kill him.
