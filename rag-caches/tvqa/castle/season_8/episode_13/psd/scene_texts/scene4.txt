Castle : would be happy to help you solve this linguistic mystery.
UNK: Castle, you're not gonna work the case.
Beckett : So, why don't you just, uh, go back home,
Beckett : and I will see you tonight.
UNK: Oh.
Castle : While I do love kissing you, Beckett,
Castle : it's just a little creepy when you do in front of a dead body.

Ryan : scrape together this much cash?
Beckett : Now, that threatening text that Eddie received
Beckett : was about owing someone money.
Beckett : I'd be shocked ifthose two aren't related.
UNK: Ifthey are, then I might be of assistance.
UNK: Vikram Singh : Turns out the text was sent from an untraceable burner.
UNK: Vikram Singh : But when the text was sent, it had to go through a wireless network.
Ryan : Did you track down the network?
Vikram : Yep. It belongs to an English as a Second Language school.
Esposito : Is there any connection to Eddie Ramirez?
Vikram : I spoke with the teacher who said that Eddie was a part of the class,
Vikram : but he was absent yesterday when the text was sent.
UNK: - AII right, guys, go check it out. - AII right.
UNK: "To get to JFK Airport from here",

UNK: "But since you are late for your flight,"
UNK: "I suggest you take a cab."
Esposito : - Yo, we're NYPD. - We need to talk.
UNK: "Yo, we're NYPD. we need to talk."

Emerson : The students have been talking about it all morning.
Ryan : We understand that Eddie missed class yesterday.
Ryan : Do you know if he was avoiding any of the other students?
Ryan : Perhaps someone he was having problems with.
UNK: Eddie? No. He was a sweet man, a gentle soul. Everybody liked him.
