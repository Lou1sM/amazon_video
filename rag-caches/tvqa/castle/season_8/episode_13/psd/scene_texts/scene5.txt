Esposito : Well, not everybody.
Esposito : This text was sent yesterday during class.
UNK: Any idea who might've written that?
UNK: "Where go my money, Eddie? Yous owe huge. Paybacks time."
Emerson : I don't know. It's hard to say.
UNK: AII my students are still learning English.
UNK: Well, then we're gonna need to talk to all your students one by one.
UNK: That's gonna be harder than you think, Detective.
Emerson : Most of my students come from countries where the cops are corrupt,
UNK: so, they're not gonna wanna talk to you.
Ryan : Look, Teach, we don't tell you how to conjugate a verb.
Ryan : Don't tell us how to interview a suspect.
UNK: Yeah, we're gonna get them to talk.
Beckett : And you couldn't get any of them to talk?
Ryan : Javi did get a contact number for Eddie's next-of-kin in EI Salvador.
Esposito : That's true. But there was no one home,
Esposito : so I had to leave a message.
UNK: Captain, we can drag each of the students down into interrogation,
Ryan : sweat the truth out of them.
UNK: Uh, no, ifthey're already afraid of cops, it's only gonna alienate them further.
Beckett : But there might be another way to do this.
Esposito : What do you have in mind?
UNK: Eh, don't worry about it.
Beckett : Why don't you guys dig into those students' Iives.
Beckett : Clearly one of them is hiding their true feelings about Eddie.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: - Hey, whatare you doing? - Nothing. Just reading a book.
Beckett : Do you really think you can figure out who sent that text based on linguistics?
Castle : Yeah, I can do that.
UNK: AII I have to do is hear them speak and I can match the syntax. why?
UNK: Well, you might be able to work this case after all.
Beckett : At least in an undercover capacity.
UNK: Really?
UNK: How?
Castle : Bonjour, everyone!
UNK: Hello, Jean-Luc.
UNK: Hello, Jean-Luc, welcome to our English as a Second Language class.
