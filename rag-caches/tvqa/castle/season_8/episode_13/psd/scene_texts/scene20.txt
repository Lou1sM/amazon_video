Beckett : Eddie's killer was solicited by Judge Caldwell.
Beckett : Which means he's complicit in the murder.
Beckett : So you help me identify his killer,
Beckett : and we will put the good judge away in federal prison for the rest of his life.
UNK: Agent Napier : Meet Alonzo Sanchez.
UNK: Agent Napier : Foot solider for the Sinaloa drug cartel based out of San Miguel.
Beckett : What's his connection to your case?
UNK: Agent Napier : Judge Caldwell expedited his visa 48 hours ago.
UNK: Agent Napier : We weren't sure why until you mentioned Eddie Ramirez.
UNK: Turns out that they have history.
UNK: Agent Napier : Eddie killed Alonzo's brother, Mario, back when he was a cop in EI Salvador.
UNK: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
Esposito : This must be who Judge Caldwell was talking about.
Beckett : Alonzo was out for revenge against Eddie,
Beckett : and the judge was all too happy to help.
Ryan : Alonzo Sanchez landed at JFK four hours before Eddie was killed.
Beckett : Okay, sounds like we have our killer.
Beckett : Now, we just have to track him down before he goes back home.
Ryan : We might be too late for that.
UNK: He boarded a flight 15 minutes ago. He's already in the air.
Esposito : Well, then we're done. There's no way we can get him now.
UNK: You can't, but I can.
UNK: Agent Napier : This is Agent Napier. I need to turn a plane around.
UNK: It's too bad your plane got rerouted, Alonzo.
Beckett : On the bright side, I spoke to the airline and you're still gonna get the miles.
UNK: You got nothing on me. I was here legally.
UNK: And what was the purpose ofyour trip?
Alonzo : Visiting an old friend.
Beckett : Visiting? Or feeding him to the snakes?
