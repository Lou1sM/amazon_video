Beckett : that our victim is Eddie Ramirez, right?
UNK: Yes. Uh, here are his personal effects.
Perlmutter : Cause of death was blunt force trauma to the skull.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Perlmutter : Based on lividity, I'd say it took place between 9 : 00 and 11 : 00 last night.
UNK: So, then the killer must've dumped his body in the snake pit
Beckett : to slow down our investigation.
Castle : Genius plan!
Perlmutter : Mr. Castle, what the hell are you doing here?
Castle : It's nice to see you, too, Perlmutter.
Perlmutter : Can't you see the lady doesn't love you anymore?
Perlmutter : Be a man. walk away.
Perlmutter : See, it's because of nitwit, pretty boys like you
