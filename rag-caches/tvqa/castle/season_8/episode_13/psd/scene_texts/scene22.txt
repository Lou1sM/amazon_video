Beckett : So what made you believe him?
Alonzo : Eddie knew things about Mario
Alonzo : that only someone close to my brother would know.
Alonzo : And his attitude wasn't that of a man lying to save his life.
Beckett : What do you mean by that?
Alonzo : Eddie hated the man that he was back in EI Salvador.
Alonzo : What he did to protect my brother weighed on him.
Alonzo : He told me that he despised everything my family stands for,
Alonzo : what he used to stand for.
Alonzo : That's why he came to America. To start over, build a new life here.

Becket : So, Alonzo alibied out.
Becket : Looks like we were wrong about Judge Caldwell's involvement.
Castle : No. we're missing something.
Castle : Eddie confronted the judge and the next day he was killed.
Beckett : Well, we know it wasn't the judge. He was under 24-hour surveillance.
Beckett : And besides, he thought that Alonzo was gonna take care of it.
Castle : Eddie confronts the judge.
Castle : Twelve hours later, Alonzo's on a plane with an approved visa.
Castle : How did the judge even know about Alonzo? who told him?
Beckett : No, you're right. We didn't even know about Alonzo.
Beckett : How did the judge find out so quickly?
Castle : There has to be someone else involved in this conspiracy.
Castle : Someone close to Eddie.
Beckett : The only people that are close to him are in the ESL class.
Beckett : So, who would kill him?
Ryan : I think I know.
Castle : And you know what this means, Beckett?
Castle : After all these years, I finally get to say "J'accuse."
