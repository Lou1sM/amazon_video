UNK: Kate Beckett : Babe, did you set your hair on fire again?
UNK: Richard Castle : That was one time. And, no. No, no.
UNK: I'm just, uh, so good-Iooking I'm literally smoking hot.
Beckett : - Okay, what do you have? - Ah, that is... Just, uh...
UNK: - Let's just see it. Just a little. - Wait a second.
Beckett : Okay. Okay.
UNK: Ah!
Beckett : - Oh, my God. - First day. How're you feeling?
UNK: Um, exhilarated and frightened and everything in between.
UNK: I wish that you were coming with me.
Castle : Oh, sweetie, we talked about this. What am I gonna do?
Castle : Sit outside your office and fetch you coffee?
Beckett : Yeah, you're great at fetching. I trained you well.
Castle : This is a good change for us.
Beckett : Is it?
Castle : Yes, absolutely. And, besides,
Castle : with all the money I spent on the remodeling of my PI office,
UNK: I gotta take some cases so I can write that place off.
Castle : Now, come on, dig in.
Beckett : No. I'm so nervous I couldn't eat.
Castle : Who said anything about eating? I said, "Dig in."
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : - Like dig, dig in? Right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
UNK: Okay. AII right. Um...
Castle : Full on.
Castle : Keep going.
Castle : - Like that. - Wow.
Castle : What? That was supposed to be a decoder ring.
Beckett : Oh, my God. This is so beautiful.
Beckett : Um, would you mind getting that?
Castle : Yeah, yeah. Here.
UNK: Thanks.
Castle : Captain Beckett's phone.
UNK: Uh, Katherine Beckett, please?
UNK: Of course. Please wait just one moment.
UNK: - Trade you. Thank you. - Here you go.
Beckett : Yeah, this is Beckett.
UNK: Uh-huh.
Beckett : Okay, understood.
Beckett : Yeah, you know what, I'm not interested,
Beckett : so why don't you take me off the list?
UNK: Thanks.
Beckett : Telemarketers. I swear, there should be tougher laws against them.
Castle : Well, if you hadn't turned down the chance to run for State Senate,
UNK: you could've passed some.
UNK: Wow, I love this. I'm gonna cherish this.
UNK: Thank you. Mmm.
UNK: Okay, I've got a meeting at One PP.
UNK: - Knock 'em dead. - Thanks.
UNK: Javier Esposito : Bro, what are you doing? You know I got dibs on Beckett's desk.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : I will play you knife, gun, Kevlar for it.
Esposito : Let's do this.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : - Knife. - Gun.
Esposito : You fool, you brought a knife to a gunfight. Blam.
Ryan : - Two out of three? - No way. Kick rocks.
Ryan : Javi, we're pathetic.
Esposito : No, you're pathetic. You're the one who got the crappy desk.
Ryan : No. Look, I mean, here we are moving desks,
Ryan : everyone else is moving up.
Ryan : Gates, she's the new deputy chief. Beckett, she's the new captain.
Man : - So? - So, when's it gonna be our turn?
Ryan : Get promoted, make more money.
Esposito : Bro, where's this coming from?
Ryan : Jenny's pregnant again. We found out last night.
Esposito : Oh, wow! That's great. Congratulations.
