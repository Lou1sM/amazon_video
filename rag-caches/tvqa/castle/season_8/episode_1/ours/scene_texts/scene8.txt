UNK: Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Beckett : I couldn't.
UNK: Hey, what's going on?
UNK: Uh...
Beckett : - I've gotta go. - No, no.
Castle : Kate, why are you shutting me out?
Beckett : Castle, I love you.
Castle : Kate. Kate!
Castle : Kate. Kate!
Esposito : Castle! Hey, man, you okay?
Castle : Beckett, she was here. She was here!
Esposito : What? where?
UNK: Dad!
Castle : Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I'm okay. I'm okay.
Woman : It's okay.
UNK: ESU says the building is secure. There's no sign of Beckett.
Castle : Why doesn't Beckett trust me?

Castle : Then why is she keeping me in the dark?
Castle : I don't need protecting.
