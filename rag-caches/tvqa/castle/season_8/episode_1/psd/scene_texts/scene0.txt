UNK: Kate Beckett : Babe, did you set your hair on fire again?
UNK: Richard Castle : That was one time. And, no. No, no.
UNK: I'm just, uh, so good-Iooking I'm literally smoking hot.
Beckett : - Okay, what do you have? - Ah, that is... Just, uh...
UNK: - Let's just see it. Just a little. - Wait a second.
Beckett : Okay. Okay.
UNK: Ah!
Beckett : - Oh, my God. - First day. How're you feeling?
UNK: Um, exhilarated and frightened and everything in between.
UNK: I wish that you were coming with me.

Castle : Sit outside your office and fetch you coffee?
Beckett : Yeah, you're great at fetching. I trained you well.
