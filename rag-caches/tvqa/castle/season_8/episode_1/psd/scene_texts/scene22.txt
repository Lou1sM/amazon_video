Hayley : You're not scaring me, guys.
Esposito : You think we're playing?
Esposito : Castle's one of us. which means you better come clean right now,
UNK: or every cop in this city is gonna make it their mission to jam you up.
Hayley : I understand the passion, but I have a reputation to uphold.
UNK: My clients think that I roll over every time a cop says, "Boo,"
Hayley : I'm looking for a new line of work.
UNK: Damn it, my dad's in trouble!
Alexis : If you know anything about where he is, you have to tell us.
Hayley : Alexis, it's not that simple.
Alexis : Yes, it is.
UNK: Please.
Hayley : Okay. There is something I kept to myself,
UNK: but it's not gonna help you. It's a dead end.
UNK: Spill.
Hayley : There was a woman at the storage locker.
Hayley : We mixed it up a little.
Hayley : When she kicked me, something transferred from her boot.
Hayley : I had a lab test it. It's creosote.
Hayley : It's a form of coal tar primarily used to treat railway ties.
Hayley : There are tens of thousands of those ties used in the subway.
Esposito : You get a copy of the lab report?
UNK: Yeah.
Ryan : Tie's not from the subway.
Beckett : - What? - How do you know?
Ryan : No traces of any steel dust or any other pollutants.
UNK: My guess is that the railroad tie's new.
Esposito : I'll call MTA. See where they store those things.
Beckett : Thank you.
Brooks : Where is she?
Brooks : Where's your wife, Castle?
Castle : I don't know, I swear.
Aj : That is the wrong answer.
Brooks : Tell me where your wife is.
Brooks : Tell me where she is!
Brooks : - Where is she? - I don't know.
Brooks : Come on, Castle, no woman is worth dying for.
Castle : Come on!
Brooks : Where is she?
Brooks : I believe that you're telling the truth.
Castle : I do. I believe you're telling me the truth.
Brooks : But unfortunately, that means it's time for you to die.
Brooks : Sorry about that.
