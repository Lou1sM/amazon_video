Brooks : This is a simple question. Where's Kate Beckett?
Castle : I don't know. And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you.
UNK: You know, that's amazing, they all say that.
Aj : And yet they all end up talking in the end.
Beckett : You know, since we're asking questions,
Castle : maybe you guys could fill in a few blanks for me.
Castle : For example, if Bracken isn't your boss, then who is?
Beckett : You know what? I don't think he's taking this seriously.
Aj : Maybe a little pain will help him focus.
UNK: Pass.
Castle : But you know what? I would kill for a nice cappuccino right now, extra froth.
Brooks : You expect us to believe that your wife is keeping you in the dark?
Aj : Look, this isn't working. How do you wanna do this?
Aj : Start by cutting off his fingers until he talks?
UNK: Orjump straight for the wedding vegetables?
Beckett : You know what? Actually, I was thinking
UNK: something maybe a little more, uh, psychological.
UNK: I'm gonna be honest with you, that doesn't look that scary.
Brooks : Well, why don't you look again?
Aj : Okay, I might puke.
Brooks : Where is she, Castle?
Hayley : I don't know.
UNK: Hmm?
Brooks : Where is she?
Hayley : I don't know!
Brooks : Where is she?
Hayley : I don't know anything.
Hayley : The last time I saw Castle was outside the prison.
UNK: You'd think an ex-cop would understand obstruction ofjustice.
Ryan : Yeah, especially since arresting her for it
Ryan : will torpedo her investigator's license.
