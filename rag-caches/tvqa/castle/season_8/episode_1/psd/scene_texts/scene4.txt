Castle : Looks like a Tarantino film came to life in here.
Ryan : Yeah, now meet our stars.
Ryan : This is Greg Minoso.
UNK: Over here, we got Jake Fitz.
Ryan : And finally, we come to Dustin Chambers.
UNK: And check this out, they were each packing identical .40 cals.
Castle : I take it they weren't part of the construction crew.
Ryan : No. Renovations aren't scheduled to begin until next week.
UNK: Okay. So what happened?
UNK: Truth is, we're not sure yet.
UNK: What we do know is that gunfire was heard around 9 : 07 a.m.
UNK: And continued for a minute or two.
Castle : So they shot each other?
UNK: Lanie Parish : Nope. Their wounds are from a downward angle.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Maybe 45 degrees, which means they probably all were shot from up there.
Lanie : Yep. The shooter was definitely up here.
