UNK: 9mm.
UNK: AII right,
UNK: he must've capped them from up here, boom, boom, boom,
UNK: and then boogied out that exit.
UNK: Ew. Guys.
UNK: Oh.
Ryan : Looks like our shooter took a bullet from one of the dead guys down there,
UNK: falls back up against the wall,
UNK: grabbing the drop cloth, pulling it down with him.
UNK: AII right, let's contact hospitals...
Castle : This is Beckett's.
Lanie : Wait, what did you just say?
Castle : I gave it to her this morning.
Castle : She was here.
Castle : Tell me.
Esposito : Lanie said that blood was a match to Beckett's.
Castle : But there was so much blood.
UNK: Okay. Okay, but this is... This is Beckett we're talking about.
Castle : Yeah, yeah, she's as tough as they come.
UNK: Exactly. So, she must've shot those three guys.
Castle : And since she hasn't contacted us,
Castle : we can assume that their partners abducted her. But why?
Castle : We need to dig into the backgrounds of those dead shooters.
UNK: We need to find out who they're working with.
Esposito : That's the thing, we can't.
Esposito : Their IDs are all fake and their prints aren't in the system.
Esposito : Castle, do you have any idea what Beckett was doing at that theater?
UNK: She was supposed to be at One PP.
Esposito : I talked to Gates.
Esposito : Beckett didn't have anything on the books.
Castle : So, she lied to me?
Ryan : Guys, I got a hit on one of the dead shooter's credit cards.
UNK: He rented a short-term apartment through an online site.
UNK: NYPD!
UNK: Ryan, I got dead space.
Ryan : - Castle, stay put. - NYPD!
