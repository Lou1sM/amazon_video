Alexis : Already did. They went to a prison upstate.
Castle : Really? Is she still there?
Alexis : No. But she visited an inmate, william Bracken.
UNK: Bracken?
Hayley : Okay, why is your wife visiting a disgraced former senator?
Castle : They have history.
Hayley : What kind of history?
Castle : He had Beckett's mother killed.
Alexis : It's why she became a cop. She dedicated her life to hunting him.
Hayley : Okay, so what's with the reunion? And why today of all days?
Castle : Because Bracken's behind this.
Hayley : I know he was a powerful man,
Hayley : but that sort of influence dries up when you're serving life in prison.
Castle : You don't know the kind of people Bracken was aligned with.
Castle : Mercenaries, dealers... The worst of the worst.
Castle : He made a lot of people rich. A lot ofwhom may still owe him favors.
Hayley : You're saying that william Bracken ordered a hit on your wife?
Castle : Beckett ruined his so-called legacy... His life.
Castle : He's out for payback.
