Hayley : You really think Bracken's behind this?
Castle : The story tracks.
Castle : Bracken is a megalomaniac who blames Beckett for ruining his life,
Castle : even though it was justice for what he did to her mother.
UNK: - You gonna be here when I come out? - No.
Castle : Because I texted Ryan and Esposito.
Hayley : I said no cops.
Castle : You'd rather there be a storage locker full of guns out there?
Hayley : It's not my problem.
UNK: Look, Rick, ifyou want to be a real PI, and notjust play dress-up,
UNK: you're gonna have to make some changes in how you operate.
Castle : Changes like lying to my friends?
Hayley : Yeah, sometimes.
Hayley : And sometimes, you're even gonna have to screw them over.
Castle : Yeah, no, thanks.
UNK: Look, nice guys don'tjust finish last in this business, Castle.
Hayley : They end up dead.
Castle : I'll see you around.
Hayley : You really love her, don't you?
Castle : Like a house on fire.
Hayley : Must be nice.
Hayley : Speed dial five.
UNK: Go.
Hayley : - It's me. - Whatdo you need?
Hayley : Tell the lab I'm coming in with something for them to test.
UNK: I'm gonna need it ID'd right away.
UNK: No. No, no, no, no. Forget it. I got nothing to say to you.
UNK: Oh, tough!
Castle : I know Beckett was here, and I know why.
UNK: So you're gonna call off your dogs right now.
UNK: Or what? You're gonna write something mean about me?
UNK: I'm gonna start a scholarship in your name,
Castle : and offer it to the children of the first inmate
Castle : who shanks you in the prison laundry.
UNK: You'd be wasting your money.
