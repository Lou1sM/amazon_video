UNK: Freeze it.
UNK: Miss Stryker, am I getting in trouble for this?
Alexis : We'll keep it our little secret.
Castle : Who the hell are these people?
UNK: Just look for anything that we can use to track these guys.
Castle : These are the same .40 calibers the shooters in the theater had.
UNK: Who did you just text? The cops?
Hayley : We had a deal. You shook on it.
UNK: Ifyou wanted a binding agreement, we should've pinky-sweared.
Hayley : What are you, four?
UNK: Hey!
Castle : Hayley... what happened?
Hayley : I got my ass kicked.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : Hey, what's up?
Alexis : Dad, I was able to track Beckett and that mystery man to a taxi.
Castle : You are the best!
UNK: Okay, uh, now all we have to do is call the cab company,
UNK: figure out where they went.
