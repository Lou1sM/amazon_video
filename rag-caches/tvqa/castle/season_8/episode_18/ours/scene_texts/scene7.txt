Hayley : Oh, God. It must've had a virus of some sort.
Beckett : So, I spoke with the FBI
Beckett : and they are considering this an act of terror.
UNK: How bad is the damage?
Beckett : It's gonna be a few days before the power is back up in London.
Beckett : - Maybe more. - Fantastic.
UNK: So, I've unwittingly plunged my hometown
Hayley : back into the 16th century.
Castle : That might not be all that bad.
Castle : I mean Hamlet was written in the 16th Century...
Castle : I'm not helping.
Hayley : Kate, do they know about my involvement yet?
Beckett : They traced the money to your account.
Beckett : And there is a warrant out for your arrest.
UNK: Excuse me. Hayley, uh, is this Karla?
Hayley : Yes. with our old friend, Ned.
UNK: A security camera across the street
Ryan : Caught them leaving this bar on their way to the office.
Ryan : The bartender remembers Karla,
Ryan : but he'd never seen her before that night.
Ryan : And unfortunately, Ned paid the bill.
Hayley : So we have no way to track her.
Ryan : Well, we're scrubbing Bryce and Marcus'
Ryan : computers and cell phones.
Ryan : One of them had to have been in contact with her.
Ryan : Don't worry, we'll find her.
Beckett : Look, we'll keep you in the loop, but a police precinct
Beckett : is probably the worst place to hide from the feds.
UNK: Or we can go back to the PI office.
Castle : You can stay out of sight in the panic room
Castle : until we clear your name.
Hayley : No. I can't let you guys cover for me...
UNK: Yeah, yeah. No, we got your back. Just go.
UNK: So, how bad is it?
UNK: She's going to need a miracle to stay out ofjail.
UNK: I wish I'd remembered something about her.
Hayley : A tattoo, a scar...
Hayley : You want a laugh?
Hayley : The only thing I recall about this woman
Hayley : is poor Ned fumbling around with her fancy corset.
Castle : Tell me more. was it cotton or lace?
UNK: Ext - Est. Skyscraper - Morning : - Ew! - Perv much?
Castle : - I'm serious. - Okay.
