Hayley : It means abandon everything and everyone.
Hayley : It means run for your life and don't look back.
Alexis : - You can't do that. - I have no choice.
Hayley : Yes, you do.
UNK: After years offloating from one place to the next,
Alexis : you've finally found a real home here.
Hayley : And I might be putting you and it in danger by staying,
Hayley : - I have to go. Now. - No.
Alexis : You have to stay and fight.
Alexis : Figure out what's really going on here and fix it.
Alexis : Please, at least try.
UNK: Ah!
Castle : Hello, gentlemen.
UNK: Ooh!
Ryan : Castle, you shouldn't show your face around here right now.
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : - Beckett's pissed. - Guys, it was a dream.
Ryan : Well, dreams are doorways to the subconscious, Castle.
UNK: Yeah, and what you did was just so...
Ryan : - Mmm. - Wrong.
Castle : She told you what I did? what did I do?
Esposito : Well, we're sworn to secrecy, bro.
Ryan : Yeah, unlike some, we would never do that to Beckett.
Castle : It was a dream.
UNK: Well, dream or not, you did something in real life,
Ryan : and Beckett's subconscious is picking up on it.
Esposito : You need to figure out what that was
Esposito : and come clean before it's too late.
Ryan : - Here's Ned. - Let's go.
Castle : Hey, how's your friend doing?
Hayley : Hmm? Oh, much better, thanks.
UNK: Marcus Janek : You know, my curiosity has been piqued.
Hayley : - Can we watch his interview? - Oh, sure, just wait till...
UNK: Okay, come.
UNK: So, Mr. Werner,
UNK: tell us where you were between 3 : 00 and 4 : 00 a.m. this morning?
Ned : Home, alone, asleep.
UNK: Well, that's weird, Ned.
UNK: Because your office computer says that you logged in at 3 : 02 a.m.,
UNK: just minutes before the murder.
UNK: Wait, yeah, no, yes. Yes, I was...
Ned : Now that you mention it, yes, I did.
UNK: Ipoppedinto the office fora bit just to do some work.
UNK: I didnotsee him there.
Esposito : So you were in the office alone?
UNK: Yeah. Completelyalone.
Hayley : Lying little bastard.
UNK: No cleaning crew, securityguards?
Castle : What makes you think he's lying about being alone?
Hayley : Look at his neck. See that tiny love bite?
Hayley : It's new.
Hayley : So, if Ned was alone last night, who gave him that?
Esposito : Are you lying to us, Ned?
UNK: No. No, I wouldnotlie. Never. No. No.
Ryan : You lied about not being there.
UNK: No, I didn't. I didn't lie. I just forgot.
Esposito : You forgot?
UNK: Then maybe there's something else you forgot?
Ryan : Maybe you forgot that Marcus was your partner and you let him in.
UNK: - Then you forgot that you killed him. - No.
Esposito : - So you remember killing him? - Yes.
UNK: - That's perfect. write that. - Wait, no, no, no!
Ned : Yes, yes. Yes, I didn't forget, because, no, I didn't kill him.
Ned : Look, I don't know this man.
Ned : I've never seen him before in my life.
Ned : So I couldn't have killed him.
UNK: So, your computer says you logged out at 3 : 10 a.m.
UNK: He was killed at 3 : 27 a.m. Actually, you could've killed him.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: - Wait, 3 : 27? - Mm-hmm.
UNK: No, no, no. I could not have killed him.
UNK: Because I was in a Hytch ride by then.
UNK: See?
UNK: Driverpickedme up at 3 : 19 a.m.
UNK: Hello, Neddy, Iet's have a chat, shall we?
Ned : Are you a cop?
UNK: The other detectives said I was free to go.
Hayley : Not quite.
Ned : Okay. Okay. Okay.
Ned : Yes, I will! Yes!
Beckett : What the hell is going on in here?
Hayley : Well, this gentleman would like to revise his statement.
UNK: Yes, I'd like to revise my statement.
UNK: I was not alone in my office.
UNK: Uh, about 2 : 00 a.m., in a bar, I met a smoking-hot blonde chick.
UNK: She was a very lovely young lady named Karla,
Ned : and we hit it off, so I took her back to my office.
Beckett : So why did you lie to my detectives?
Hayley : Because a security breach like this could get nasty Ned here fired.
Hayley : Go on.
Hayley : Tell the nice Captain what you did.
Ned : I was trying to impress Karla, so I...
UNK: I logged into the company's closed server
