UNK: Wes?
Hayley : Come on out. It's me.
UNK: It worked, Hayls. Our plan worked.
Mallory : This is impossible.
Mallory : Wesley Connors was caught and tried for espionage by the Iranians.
Mallory : Our intelligence sources confirmed he was executed.
Castle : Well, obviously, they were duped.
Beckett : Agent Mallory, this man perpetrated an attack
Beckett : on the London power grid and murdered two people.
Beckett : So it's time to play ball and tell us what you know.
UNK: What I'm about to tell you is highly classified and mustn't be repeated.
Mallory : Are we clear?
Mallory : The worm that crashed the London power grid
UNK: was a variation on one Hayley and wesley designed
Beckett : six years ago.
Mallory : It was used to knock out uranium enriching centrifuges
Mallory : at the Natanz reactor in Iran.
Castle : Are you talking about Stuxnet?
Castle : That computer virus
Castle : set the Iranian nuclear program back by decades.
Beckett : Stuxnet was supposedly created by the US and Israel.
Mallory : Disinformation, Captain, leaked by Her Majesty's government.
Mallory : We wanted to hit the Iranians as much as everyone else.
Mallory : So we put our two best agents on it.
Mallory : Hayley and wesley.
Mallory : Led by the recently deceased Bryce Roberts.
Mallory : The op was a success,
Mallory : however, their extraction point was compromised.
Castle : You said Hayley left wesley to die.
UNK: Yes. well, I might've exaggerated a bit to make a point.
Mallory : Truth is, wesley was late to the rendezvous,
Mallory : and MI6 command made the call.
