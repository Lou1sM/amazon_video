Hayley : It means abandon everything and everyone.
Hayley : It means run for your life and don't look back.
Alexis : - You can't do that. - I have no choice.
Hayley : Yes, you do.
UNK: After years offloating from one place to the next,
Alexis : you've finally found a real home here.
Hayley : And I might be putting you and it in danger by staying,
Hayley : - I have to go. Now. - No.
Alexis : You have to stay and fight.
Alexis : Figure out what's really going on here and fix it.
Alexis : Please, at least try.
UNK: Ah!
Castle : Hello, gentlemen.
UNK: Ooh!
Ryan : Castle, you shouldn't show your face around here right now.
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : - Beckett's pissed. - Guys, it was a dream.
Ryan : Well, dreams are doorways to the subconscious, Castle.
UNK: Yeah, and what you did was just so...
Ryan : - Mmm. - Wrong.
Castle : She told you what I did? what did I do?
Esposito : Well, we're sworn to secrecy, bro.
Ryan : Yeah, unlike some, we would never do that to Beckett.
Castle : It was a dream.
UNK: Well, dream or not, you did something in real life,
Ryan : and Beckett's subconscious is picking up on it.
Esposito : You need to figure out what that was
Esposito : and come clean before it's too late.
Ryan : - Here's Ned. - Let's go.
Castle : Hey, how's your friend doing?
Hayley : Hmm? Oh, much better, thanks.
UNK: Marcus Janek : You know, my curiosity has been piqued.
Hayley : - Can we watch his interview? - Oh, sure, just wait till...
UNK: Okay, come.
UNK: So, Mr. Werner,
UNK: tell us where you were between 3 : 00 and 4 : 00 a.m. this morning?
Ned : Home, alone, asleep.
UNK: Well, that's weird, Ned.
UNK: Because your office computer says that you logged in at 3 : 02 a.m.,
UNK: just minutes before the murder.
UNK: Wait, yeah, no, yes. Yes, I was...
Ned : Now that you mention it, yes, I did.
UNK: Ipoppedinto the office fora bit just to do some work.
UNK: I didnotsee him there.
Esposito : So you were in the office alone?
UNK: Yeah. Completelyalone.
