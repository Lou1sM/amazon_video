Castle : We find the person Marcus broke in here with,
Castle : we find his killer.
Ryan : Very good, Castle.
Esposito : Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
Castle : Why are you acting surprised?
Hayley : I don't know if it's important at all, but all those chairs are tucked in,
Hayley : - except for that one... - Except for that one there.
Castle : Yep, I noticed that, too, on the way in.
Castle : Way before she did. So...
Castle : Ned werner.
Castle : Perhaps Ned was working late last night.
Castle : Maybe he saw something.
Castle : Or maybe he's Marcus' partner and inside man.
UNK: - Please, Detective Ryan. - Thank you, Detective Esposito.
Castle : After you, boys.
UNK: Hello.
Hayley : Bryce, Marcus is dead. What the hell is going on?
