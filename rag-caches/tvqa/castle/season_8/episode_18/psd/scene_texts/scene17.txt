UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Hayley : Oh. Damn it. I recognize him. He's MI6.
Castle : I guess the FBI aren't the only ones investigating.
Castle : - You guys get in the panic room. - Yeah.
Mallory : Hello, Mr. Castle, the name's Stephen Mallory.
Castle : Do you mean Agent Mallory, MI6?
Mallory : Well, I wonder how you knew that.
Castle : Lucky guess. Do come in.
Mallory : Lovely decor. Retro but chic.
UNK: Mmm. Thank you,
Castle : but I assume Her Majesty's Secret Service
Castle : isn't interested in my interior designer.
Mallory : No. However, your business partner interests us greatly.
Castle : Well, I haven't seen Hayley since this morning.
UNK: Mr. Castle, I must find Miss Shipton before it's too late.
Mallory : Before I can no longer help her.
Castle : Well, Hayley left MI6 for a reason.
Castle : I doubt she needs your kind of help, Agent Mallory.
UNK: You may think you know Miss Shipton, but in fact, you do not.
UNK: - Could've fooled me. - I'm sure she has.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Tell me, did Miss Shipton ever tell you why she left MI6?
Castle : Something about holiday bonuses and bad fish and chips.
UNK: Charming.
Castle : Look, despite what you think, I can assure you, Hayley was framed.
Mallory : And I can assure you,
Mallory : she is the main conspirator in everything that happened today.
Castle : How can you be so sure about that?
Mallory : I have access to her confidential dossiers, Mr. Castle.
Mallory : You must trust me.
UNK: Miss Shipton is intimately involved
Mallory : in the planning and the execution of today's events.
Mallory : We have proof.
Hayley : Ignore him.
