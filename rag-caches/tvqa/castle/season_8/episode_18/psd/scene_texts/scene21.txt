Hayley : I'm going to need something with more horsepower
Hayley : in order to get to the bottom of this.
Alexis : - I'll get your laptop from the back. - You're a dear, thank you.
Alexis : Now, if it's partially your code,
Alexis : then that should help narrow down who the killer is, right?
UNK: Hayley?
UNK: Hayley...
UNK: Hayley.
Ryan : Hey, guys, we got something.
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : One of those cigar clubs paid off. Manager recognized Marcus' photo.
Beckett : - Did he see who Marcus was with? - He said Marcus came in alone.
UNK: And that he met with a guy in a brown leatherjacket
Ryan : for about 15 minutes.
Beckett : Did he get a good look at him?
UNK: No. But the club's security cam did.
UNK: Look. Brown leatherjacket. Got to be Edgar.
Beckett : This guy looks familiar. Hold on.
UNK: Oh!
Castle : - Hey, Alexis. - Dad, Hayley's gone.
Castle : Gone where?
Lanie : I don't know, but she ditched her cell phone.
Alexis : I can't track her.
Castle : Hang on. I'm putting you on speaker.
Castle : What was the last thing Hayley did before she disappeared?
Alexis : She discovered the computer worm was one she helped design years ago.
Castle : So Edgar used Hayley's own code to help frame her.
UNK: But why'd she take off right when she was closing in?
Beckett : Because she knows who the killer is. And his name isn't Edgar.
