Hayley : Your captors drove you mad.
Wesley : How can you, of all people, say that to me?
Wesley : They had it coming.
Wesley : They all did.
Wesley : Don't you see that?
Hayley : Wesley, I'm sorry.
Hayley : I'm so, so sorry.
UNK: But I have to take you in.
Mallory : The rendezvous was pre-determined.
UNK: Pre-determined
Mallory : because Hayley and wesley are in league with one another.
Castle : They are not working together.
UNK: But they were. At one point they were partners, for years,
Castle : working various black ops, maybe even one here in New York.
Beckett : Where they had an old safe house or a staging area,
Beckett : someplace that they both knew about and could trust.
Hayley : Okay, look, I can neither confirm nor deny
Mallory : MI6 has ever carried out any operations on US soil.
Castle : Yeah, yeah, yeah, just tell us where it is.
