Ned : I was very nervous.
UNK: So, after you logged onto your computer is when Karla left you?
Ned : Yes. And as far as I know,
Ned : the office was completely empty when I left.
Beckett : Did you actually see Karla Ieave the building?
UNK: No.
Beckett : So it's possible she hid and then waited until you left?
UNK: Ah...
Beckett : Hey, Ryan. Ned, here, wants to revise his statement.
UNK: Awesome. Had a little accident?
Ryan : Don't touch anything. Please.
Beckett : Uh! Excuse me, Hayley. Where are you going?
Castle : Hey, guys, is there a problem here?
Beckett : Hayley waterboarded Ned.
Hayley : I did no such thing. It was more of a swirly.
Beckett : Never mind.
Beckett : Look. Apparently, Ned was tricked by some woman named Karla
Beckett : into gaining access to the building and the secured server,
Beckett : most likely to help Marcus rob the place.
Hayley : Yeah, but clearly something happened between Marcus and Karla,
Hayley : because it looks like she's the one that drove that knife into his back.
Castle : And is that all?
Hayley : Why are you asking me?
Castle : Because clearly something is going on with you, Hayley.
Castle : Something connected to this case.
Castle : You know you can tell us.
Hayley : I was in that office last night.
Beckett : Okay, we need to talk. Now.
Hayley : Really, you want to talk in here?
Beckett : Yes, this is where we question all of our murder suspects.
Hayley : You think I killed Marcus?
Beckett : Right now, I don't know what to think.
