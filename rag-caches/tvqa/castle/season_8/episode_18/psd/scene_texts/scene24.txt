Beckett : That's why Hayley left MI6.
Beckett : She felt that they betrayed wesley and condemned him to die.
Mallory : Which brings us to our current dilemma.
Mallory : Hayley and wesley were thick as thieves.
Mallory : More loyal to each other than the service.
Castle : What are you saying?
Mallory : That it would appear
Mallory : they have teamed up once again to have their retribution.
Castle : - You're wrong. - Am I, Mr. Castle?
Mallory : Then tell me, why has Hayley suddenly disappeared?
Hayley : I don't understand.
UNK: They showed me proofyou were dead.
UNK: No.
Wesley : I just wished I was.
Hayley : What did they do to you?
Wesley : You know me, I hate taking orders. So sometimes I refused.
Wesley : But they never liked that.
Wesley : Sometimes I wished they'd just finished me off.
Wesley : There was times I tried to myself.
Hayley : - Wes, I'm sorry. - Don't be.
Wesley : See, you're the person that got me through it all.
Wesley : Know how?
Wesley : Our plan.
Wesley : Kept me going for six years.
Wesley : Gave me the will to escape.
UNK: You keep saying "our plan," but I...
Wesley : Our bloody retirement plan! Come on, Hayls.
Wesley : We used to talk all the time
UNK: about how ifwe survived the Queen's service,
Wesley : we'd spend the rest of our days traveling the world in style.
Esposito : You remember?
Hayley : - $10 million each. - Ha.
Wesley : Have you checked your bank account lately?
UNK: Now you have it, and so do I.
Wesley : You passed the test.
Hayley : This was all a loyalty test?
Wesley : It was the only way to know.
UNK: I had to put the target on your back
Wesley : and make sure you wouldn't capitulate to the authorities.
Wesley : But you didn't.
Hayley : Wesley, you murdered people, you killed Bryce.
Wesley : You're damn right I did!
Wesley : He and Her Majesty's Kingdom abandoned me,
Wesley : so they had to be punished.
Hayley : Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness.
