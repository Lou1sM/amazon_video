Hayley : Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.
Trevor : I admit nothing.
Castle : Neither did your partner before he was killed.
Trevor : Jordan is dead?
Trevor : He gave me up, didn't he?
Trevor : I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.
Castle : No, Trevor. You gave yourself up.
Castle : Back when your studio was doing Heat Wave,
Castle : I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned.
Castle : You sent it back to me with a handwritten note,
Castle : detailing why my ideas were stupid.
Castle : I never forget a bad review.
Castle : Especially one with such distinctive handwriting.
Hayley : It's the same handwriting on your serial-killer partner's screenplay.
Trevor : Richard, you're a pretty good writer.
UNK: But you should really read Jordan's work.
Trevor : Because it is inspiring.
Trevor : After I read his Gemini Killers screenplay,
Trevor : I knew that I had found a kindred spirit.
Trevor : Someone with the same desires as I had.
Trevor : And his script laid out the perfect plan for us to kill... Ow!
