Castle : There are worse places to be trapped than a five-star hotel with room service.
Bellboy : Mr. Castle, we've got your luggage.
Castle : Great, just, uh, put it right in there for me.
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: On second thought, I'm good here.
Hayley : Maybe I'll wait with you.
Castle : What's this?
Bellboy : Messenger dropped that off for you a few minutes ago.
Hayley : Thank you.
Alexis : Who's it from?
Castle : I'm not sure.
UNK: "Mr. Castle. Your services are required."
UNK: "A body has been found at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery."
UNK: "The LAPD needs your help."
UNK: And it's signed "The GDS."
UNK: who's "GDS"?
Castle : The Greatest Detective Society.
Alexis : - What's that? - It's the greatest detective society.
Castle : It's a legendary organization.
Castle : Rumor has it, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a secret member.
UNK: And it's a myth.
UNK: It's a fairy tale old PI's tell rookies to get them to do the scut work.
Castle : Said the detective that didn't get an invitation.
UNK: AII right. Real or not, we're here to investigate your missing time, Dad.
Alexis : Not a murder.
Castle : Right. But the restaurant doesn't open for another couple of hours.
Castle : Hollywood Forever Cemetery is on the way.
UNK: It can't hurt to take a look. Right?
UNK: How are we gonna get in there?
Castle : I've got it. You create a diversion...
Hayley : Uh, excuse me.
UNK: Hello, excuse me? Hey, excuse me?
Hayley : Looking for Detective Menendez.
UNK: He's, uh, with the ME.
Hayley : Thank you.
Hayley : Kurt! Hey!
