UNK: Do you think it's CIA, Ieft over from my Thailand mission?
UNK: Possible. Doubt we'll ever know for sure.
Alexis : Can't we track down where it was purchased?
Hayley : No, I'm afraid this transmitter is incredibly common,
Hayley : which makes tracking it almost impossible.
Alexis : But we have to try, right?
UNK: I mean, it's why we're here.
Castle : Kendall. wow. You certainly have baited the hook.
UNK: I had to. Especially considering it's gonna be two against one tonight.
Castle : What are you talking about?
Kendall : Come on, Rick.
Kendall : I know you're going to sneak into Austin's house to look for evidence
Kendall : while Hayley and I distract him.
UNK: I'm no fool, but you are ifyou think your Iittle plan will work without these.
UNK: Schematics to Austin Elektra's house. Where did you get those?
Kendall : Don't worry your pretty little head about that.
UNK: "Pretty."
Kendall : while Hayley and I distract Austin, you need to look for this.
Kendall : It's a false wall.
Castle : A secret room.
Castle : That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide
Castle : the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.
