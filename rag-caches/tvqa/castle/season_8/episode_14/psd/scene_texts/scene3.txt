Hayley : Yes, but any failures on my part have always been remedied
Hayley : with the finest single malt, so what do you say?
UNK: And let us in for a little look-see?
UNK: Yes?
Menendez : - Sure. Come on. - Thank you.
UNK: Thanks.
Menendez : Our victim's name is Phillip Harris. Local private investigator.
Menendez : ME said he was killed around midnight. Throat cut.
Menendez : And then the killer took out his heart.
Hayley : Done with surgical precision?
Menendez : - Not particularly. - Hmm.
Menendez : So, New York, huh?
Hayley : Yeah, just flew in this morning.
UNK: It's funny. Because our victim just flew back from New York yesterday morning.
UNK: I left word for his sister who lives there.
Hayley : Crazy coincidence.
Castle : You know, I work very closely with the 12th Precinct in New York.
