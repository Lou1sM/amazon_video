Alexis : Are you going to kill me?
UNK: What?
Hayley : Why would you say that?
Alexis : I don't know. Maybe because you're connected to my dad's missing time,
Alexis : and now you're hiding in the back of my rental car.
Hayley : Alexis, I would never hurt you.
UNK: This isn't what you think.
Alexis : What the hell is your game, Hayley?
Hayley : Believe me, you don't want to know. Neither does your father.
