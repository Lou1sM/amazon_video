UNK: Detective Kurt Menendez : Hayley, I did not know you were in town.
Hayley : Yeah, we just got in from New York.
Hayley : This is Richard Castle. Kurt Menendez. Major Crimes Division.
Castle : - Great to meet you. - Likewise.
Menendez : Doing a little grisly sightseeing?
UNK: Uh, no pleasure this time, just business.
Menendez : What kind of business?
Hayley : Oh, come on, Kurt, you know the drill. Client confidentiality and all that.
Hayley : But anything we find, we'll share with you.
Menendez : I've heard that one before.
