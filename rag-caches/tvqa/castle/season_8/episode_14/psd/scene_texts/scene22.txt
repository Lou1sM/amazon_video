Hayley : Of course he does.
Hayley : But what happens when your father starts poking his nose
UNK: into this Malcolm fellow, mmm?
Hayley : I mean, the guy is former Special Forces.
Hayley : God only knows what he's doing for a living right now.
Hayley : Isn't it safer for your father to maybe not remember what happened?
Hayley : You should delete this.
Lanie : You okay?
Alexis : Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Alexis : Why don't you head back to the spa?
Hayley : Don't have to tell me twice.
Esposito : Check this out.
Esposito : I compared the drive-on list from the studio
UNK: to people connected to the fourth New York victim, Pat Crews.
Ryan : - Any matches? - Yeah.
Esposito : Crews was a writing teacher at the New School.
UNK: One of his early students is a successful screenwriter
Esposito : named Jordan Keegan,
Esposito : who now lives in New York, but happened to be on the studio lot in LA
Esposito : when the murder weapons went missing.
Ryan : Let's pick his ass up.
UNK: So you're doing a news story on my nephew Malcolm, huh?
UNK: - Mmm-hmm. It's about war heroes. - Oh.
Dorothy : Look. Isn't he handsome?
Alexis : Oh, yeah.
Dorothy : But like I said, he's out of the country. His job keeps him really busy.
Dorothy : Let me get you his number, okay?
Castle : - Thanks. - I'll be right back.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Miss McCabe, I have to go. Thank you for your time.
Hayley : Damn it, Alexis, you're just like your old man.
Hayley : Can't leave things alone.
