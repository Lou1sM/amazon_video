Hayley : Pack your clothes?
Castle : Walk away.
Castle : Hayley, I need to know what happened to me.
Hayley : Okay, there's one last thing.
Hayley : Just before you left to get your memories erased,
Hayley : you came to me with one final request.
Castle : Like what kind of request?
UNK: That ifyou demanded to know the truth, I show you this.
Espsoito : What is this?
Hayley : It's a secret website on the dark web.
Castle : What's on it?
Hayley : Not a clue. You installed a password that only you would know.
UNK: Called it "Blair's combination."
UNK: That's from a short story I wrote when I was 17.
Castle : Never saw the light of day. What was that combination?
UNK: 4 left, 17 right...
UNK: 21 left.
Hayley : I'll step out.
Castle : No, no. You've, uh, you've earned the right to see this.
UNK: Castle on Video : Hey there, buddy.
UNK: Castle on Video : It's me. And by me, I mean you.
UNK: Castle on Video : And if you're seeing this, then you are an idiot.
UNK: Castle on Video : Because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles.
UNK: Castle on Video : What you discovered about Bracken's partnership with LokSat
UNK: is too dangerous to pursue.
UNK: LokSat?
