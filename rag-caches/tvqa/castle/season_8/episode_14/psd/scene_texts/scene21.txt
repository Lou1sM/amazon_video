Alexis : I was able to trace the tracker in my dad's watch.
Alexis : It was purchased by a man named Malcolm McCabe.
UNK: Oh.
Hayley : Born and raised in LA.
Hayley : Former Army Special Forces. Says here he's working overseas.
UNK: He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.
Alexis : We should go talk to her. See if she knows anything.
Hayley : Sure, we could do that.
Hayley : Or we could just pretend you never found this.
Alexis : Fine. But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.
