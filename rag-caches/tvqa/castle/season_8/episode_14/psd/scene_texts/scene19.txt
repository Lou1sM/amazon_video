UNK: And if I catch either ofyou working this case,
Menendez : I'll have you both arrested for obstruction.
UNK: Guard 1 : - Ah! - No, no, no, um...
Castle : Hey, maybe a little single malt scotch will smooth things over.
Menendez : Go home.
Hayley : Excuse me.
Bellboy : This just came for you, Mr. Castle.
UNK: Oh, um, thanks.
Castle : Looks like Menendez isn't the only one unhappy about last night.
Castle : Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.
Castle : Good luck.
Alexis : What's that?
UNK: This is payback.
UNK: Mason Wood : Thanks for coming in.
UNK: Where is everyone else?
UNK: Their enthusiasm for both ofyou waned
UNK: Mason Wood : after the way you conducted yourselves last night.
UNK: Mason Wood : It was messy. Boorish.
UNK: Mason Wood : Lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member.
Castle : - It was her fault. - It was his fault.
UNK: Mason Wood : No, it was my fault,
UNK: for thinking that either ofyou could ever have filled Phillip's shoes.
Castle : Mr. wood, please, give me another chance.
Kendall : No, give me another chance. I will find Phillip's killer.
Castle : She won't. She's been two steps behind me this whole time.
Kendall : Behind you? I got to Austin first.
Castle : And I got to the knife.
Castle : And although it wasn't the actual murder weapon,
Castle : thank you to my contacts at the NYPD,
Castle : I have the address to the prop master's cousin in San Pedro
Castle : who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs.
Castle : You see, I am close.
UNK: Okay. And may the best detective win.
Kendall : Don't worry. I will.
