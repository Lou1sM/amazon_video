Castle : Membership in the GDS is as good as mine.
Hayley : Yay for you.
UNK: Hungry Orchard Owner : What's wrong?
Castle : Was it the kiss with Kendall? was it?
Castle : Too much tongue? Not enough tongue?
UNK: No... well, not enough.
Hayley : No, Kendall was right. This is not a game.
UNK: IfAustin Elektra is in fact the Phantom,
UNK: then we're walking right into the lair of a serial killer.
Castle : I'm sorry. Repeat everything you said after "not enough."
Hayley : Oh, God have mercy.
Esposito : - Hey, Kev. - Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Ryan : What's up, partner?
Esposito : Castle and Hayley might be on to something.
Esposito : Turns out that movie director was in New York
Esposito : during two of the Phantom's murders.
Ryan : What about the third?
Esposito : Based on financials, there's no indication where Austin was.
UNK: Which means he could've been here
Ryan : committing that third New York homicide.
Ryan : This could be our guy.
UNK: Yeah, I'm gonna keep digging. Oh, and, uh...
Espsoito : what is this, bro?
Esposito : What are you hiding from me?
Esposito : And who is Tyler Ross,
Esposito : and why are you running a background check on him?
Ryan : Tyler's nobody.
UNK: Um, well, you see... Okay, Jenny and I, we're looking to have a new nanny.
Ryan : Or in Tyler's case, a manny.
UNK: What?
Esposito : Stop it. You're, like, the worst liar ever.
Esposito : Who is this guy?
Ryan : He's Lanie's new boyfriend.
Ryan : She wanted me to check him out. But not to tell you.
Esposito : You know what this means, right?
UNK: We are gonna have some fun at Lanie's expense.
Ryan : Hey, Lanie. I got your text.
Lanie : And I've got your murder weapon. A picture of it, anyway.
Lanie : I used the autopsies of the Phantom's victims to generate this.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.
Lanie : Exactly. Find the knife...
Ryan : Find the killer. Nice work.
Lanie : So how's the background check going?
Ryan : Oh, pretty good. So far.
Lanie : I don't like the sound of that.
UNK: No, there's nothing to worry about. Yet. It's just a rumor.
Lanie : Let's hear it.
Ryan : Okay. He's got a thing about clowns.
Lanie : That's okay. Lots of people are afraid of clowns.
Ryan : Oh, no, no, he's not afraid of them. He likes them.
UNK: Like a fetish?
Lanie : Oh, good Lord.
UNK: I haven't verified it yet. I'd still have to speak with one of his exes.
Lanie : Okay. Keep me posted, will you?
Castle : Ryan, that is excellent. Thank you.
Castle : Now, just hold off on giving it to LAPD just until morning.
