UNK: there's gonna be an exact match?
Esposito : And we have a warrant for your place.
Esposito : Now, what are we going to find there?
Esposito : The gun that you used?
Esposito : The original Van Gogh?
Graham : He was my brother.
Graham : I didn't want to kill him. I just needed the money.
Beckett : So, can you tell the difference?
UNK: Uh... No, not at all.
Hayley : Oh, I spoke to the current owner, told him the whole story.
Hayley : And he pledged that he's going to give it to the state museum
UNK: while Lorenzo's family's issue is being adjudicated.
Hayley : So, a bit of a happy ending.
Beckett : Well, it was a pleasure working with you.
Hayley : Yeah, you, too.
Hayley : You're not so bad for a cop.
Beckett : Thank you. You're not so bad for a...
Beckett : what exactly do you do?
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Hey, you need any help?
Esposito : Not from you.
Ryan : Javi, look.
Ryan : Could you find it in your heart to forgive me?
UNK: AII right.
Ryan : We're cool?
UNK: Yeah.
Ryan : Ow! Oh!
Ryan : I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Esposito : - Oh, like you didn't mean to do that. - That was an accident!
UNK: Well, it seems like there's been a lot of accidents
Esposito : around here lately, Detective.
UNK: Oh. Oh. It's gonna be like that, Sarge? Okay.
Ryan : Let's make it even, then. Eye for an eye, cheek for a cheek.
UNK: Get your revenge, okay? Shoot me in the ass!
Ryan : Go. Now.
Ryan : Shoot me in the ass. Come on. Do it right now.
Esposito : - Get up. - Let's squash this right now.
Ryan : - Just a quick pop. - He's playing.
UNK: - Right in the butt. Go! - Hey!
UNK: You're embarrassing me. Hey.
Beckett : Knock it off!
UNK: - He started it with this... - You know what?
Beckett : If the two of you can't figure this out on your own,
Beckett : then you're doing it in therapy.
Beckett : And that's an order. No ifs, ands, or buts.
Beckett : I didn't mean it like that.
UNK: How...
Castle : Hi. How're you feeling? Or rather, how're you smelling?
Mia : Oh, the doctor said my schnoz should go back to normal
Mia : once the swelling goes down.
Mia : Those for me?
Castle : Yeah, they're paper. So you don't have to smell...
Castle : I'm so sorry for everything.
UNK: Don't.
Mia : Come on, I did some pretty extraordinary things yesterday.
Mia : And you were right, I haven't been living.
Mia : And thanks to you, now I will.
Castle : Well, then I think you're gonna like that card.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: It's a couple oftickets to my mother's new play.
UNK: Ah!
Castle : Mia, I just think the world's a better place with you running around in it.
Mia : You know, you're easier to be around when I can't smell you.
UNK: Thanks.
Mia : Beckett still loves you,
Mia : with a passion.
Mia : And you don't have to measure pheromones to sense that.
UNK: I've spent my career
UNK: manufacturing the aromas of love for perfumes and colognes.
UNK: But they're all just forgeries,
UNK: like that painting.
UNK: What you and Beckett have...
UNK: Now, that's the genuine article.
UNK: Beckett?
