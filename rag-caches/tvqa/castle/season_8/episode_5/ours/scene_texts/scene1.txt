Ryan : Can you interview her? You always smell so pretty.
UNK: Captain.
Beckett : Okay. Fine.
Beckett : You and Espo dig into Justin's life, though.
UNK: See ifyou can find a connection to someone named Falcon.
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : I'm Captain Beckett.
Beckett : Thank you so much for coming in, Ms. Laszlo.
Mia : Let's just get this over with.
UNK: Uh, so, what do you remember about the murder this morning?
Mia : Not much.
Mia : I heard two gunshots.
Mia : And then a guy with a ski mask got on the elevator with me.
Mia : I thought he was going to kill me,
Mia : - but he didn't. - Mmm-hmm.
Mia : Instead, he got off at the ground level.
Mia : I called 911 and left.
Mia : Can I go home now?
Beckett : - Uh, no. - Why not?
Beckett : Because I'm not done asking you questions just yet.
Mia : Do you always eat kale for breakfast? 'Cause that is just wrong.
UNK: How did you know that I had kale this morning?
Mia : You reek of it.
Mia : Like, this room stinks of grade-D Greek food.
Beckett : You're very sensitive to smell.
Mia : Oh, you should change your name to Captain Obvious.
Mia : It's called hyperosmia. Look it up.
UNK: Okay. So what did our killer smell like?
UNK: Gosh. I don't know. It was either puppies or gunpowder.
Beckett : Are you always this unpleasant?
Mia : - Yep. - Huh.
Beckett : Is there anything else that you remember
Beckett : about the guy in the elevator?
Mia : He was a white guy.
Mia : He was about six feet tall. Dark clothes.
Mia : And he was carrying a silver briefcase that he got off of that dead guy.
UNK: Allright. Thankyou verymuch.
Esposito : Well, the owner confirms it. The garage has no cameras.
UNK: And I got uniforms pulling footage from surrounding areas.
Esposito : Like a well-oiled machine.
Graham : What's that?
Esposito : It's the exam results.
UNK: - Moment oftruth. - Yeah.
UNK: AII right, bro. On three.
Ryan : - One, two... - Two...
UNK: Yes.
Esposito : Sergeant Esposito, right here.
Esposito : Damn. Sorry, bro.
Ryan : I don't understand. How did you pass and I didn't?
UNK: Oh.
Castle : Hey, Ryan. Next time, pal.
Castle : - Espo, way to go! - Hey!
UNK: Thanks. You know...
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey. How you doin'?
UNK: I'm good.
UNK: You know, ifyou just wait by the elevators,
Beckett : Ryan and Espo will take you home.
Mia : I'd rather French kiss a corpse.
Beckett : A uniform will drive you.
Castle : She seems nice. What's with the nose thing?
UNK: Mmm. Long story. Um...
UNK: - Listen, I was planning on calling you. - Really?
UNK: Well, here I am.
Castle : Roguishly handsome and at your service.
Castle : What do you need?
UNK: Um...
Beckett : I was just hoping I could stop by the loft later on.
Beckett : 'Cause I need to pick up the rest of my stuff.
UNK: Uh...
UNK: - Absolutely. Yeah, anytime. - Okay.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: She's clearly got the hots for you.
UNK: Who?
UNK: Captain Hootchie Mama.
Mia : Her pheromone output went through the roof when she saw you.
Castle : And you know this, how?
Mia : I can smell it.
Mia : Like I can smell that you washed your hair
Mia : with shaving cream this morning.
Mia : And you chose day-old tacos over brushing your teeth.
Castle : Are you a wizard?
Mia : A cursed one.
Castle : Wait. You have hyperosmia.
Castle : Just how heightened is your olfactory acuity?
Mia : It's off the charts. How do you...
Castle : I read a lot.
Castle : You're telling me you can tell exactly how Beckett feels about me
Castle : just by her smell?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: I'll tell you what, I have a brand-new Ferrari downstairs.
Castle : Smells like heaven.
Castle : How about I give you a ride home, and you can tell me a little more?
Castle : Or Officer Julian here can give you a ride home,
Castle : and his favorite meal is sausages and chocolate milk.
UNK: Um...
Castle : That's what I thought. Julian, I got this. Thanks.
Castle : Hayley? what are you doing here?
UNK: Working.
Castle : She likes me a lot, too. You could probably tell...
UNK: No.
Ryan : We're still looking into our victim's phone records and social media,
Ryan : but so far, we haven't found anyone named Falcon.
Esposito : But we did find a possible link to a company called The Falcon Unit.
UNK: We're checking them out now.
Hayley : Why bother, when I can just tell you who they are?
Beckett : Somebody knows how to make an entrance.
Hayley : - Hello, all. - What's up, girl?
UNK: How you doin'? Nice to see you again. Great pants.
Beckett : - What? - Anyway, you were saying?
