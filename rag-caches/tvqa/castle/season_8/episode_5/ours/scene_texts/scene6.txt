Mechanic : - Yes, sir. How can I help you? - Yes.

Mia : I see.
UNK: So your Ferrari was "stolen."
Castle : Yes. And I'm afraid my poor insurance company's
Castle : going to have to pay out a fortune when I report it.
Castle : Now, how much extra can I look forward to making?
UNK: Well, gonna have to run some numbers,
Mechanic : but I'll see what our foreign buyers might pay for it.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: AII right. That looks like Liam's car right there.
Castle : Let's go.
Castle : Love it.
Castle : Want it.
Castle : Need it.
Mia : A convertible? Yuck.
UNK: AII right. why don't you pop the trunk?
Mia : Oh. Okay.
Hollister : What the hell are you doing?
Castle : - Oh, just taking a look at the cars. - Yeah. Back up.
UNK: Hey, no problem.
UNK: Yes.
Hollister : Hey! Get out of there.
UNK: Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Castle : No need for that.
UNK: Mia!
Mia : Did I do okay?
Castle : You did perfectly.
Ryan : I give up.
UNK: How the hell did the two ofyou trap Liam in his own trunk?
Mia : Because we're awesome, and you two suck.
Mia : Next question.
Castle : - What happened to you? - Injured in the line of duty.
Castle : Really? How?
UNK: I accidentally shot him in the gluteus maximus.
Esposito : In the ass?
UNK: Or maybe I should give this to you.
Castle : I'm sorry. This is so not funny.
Mia : You're right. It's hilarious.
Mia : It's hilarious.
Castle : Come on, Mia, let's make way for Crackshot Ryan and Assposito.
UNK: "Assposito."
Esposito : Liam, NYPD.
Esposito : We're about to open this trunk, so don't do anything stupid.
Hollister : It wasn't me.
Esposito : So, I guess it wasn't you
Esposito : who had the stolen painting in the silver briefcase.
Ryan : I suppose it also wasn't you who tried to kill us in that building?
Hollister : Oh, trust me, if I was trying to kill you,
Hollister : - you'd be dead. - Wow.
Hollister : I was laying down a suppressive fire in order to get away.
UNK: I aimed to miss.
Hollister : Unlike you, mate.
Hollister : You shot your own partner in the ass. Blimey.
UNK: Okay. Let's not concern ourselves with who shot Detective Assposito...
UNK: Esposito... Detective Esposito.
Ryan : Sit down! Now. Sit down. Or I'm locking you up.
UNK: Oh.
Ryan : Rather, let's discuss how you shot Justin.
Hollister : I'm telling you, it wasn't me.
Ryan : Look, I get it. You were pissed.
UNK: He jumped you on that transporterjob.
Ryan : Screwed you out of a big commission.
Esposito : And then you tracked him down and you confronted him in that garage.
Esposito : You probably didn't even mean to kill.
Hollister : I didn't shoot Justin.
Esposito : Cut that crap.
UNK: AII the evidence points to you.
Hollister : Which is why I ran from you guys.
Hollister : Look, I was at that parking garage, but when I left, Justin was alive.
