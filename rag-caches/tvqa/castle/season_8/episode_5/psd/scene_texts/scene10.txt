Castle : That's nice.
UNK: - You're an art fan, Freddy? - I like comic books.
Hayley : - How about Van Gogh? - I've never heard of him.
UNK: Where were you at 10 : 15 this morning?
Freddy : I was uptown walking my cat.
Hayley : And yet we have proof that you were in the East Village committing a homicide.
Freddy : Never happened. My cat hates the East Village.
UNK: Captain?
UNK: Um.
Ryan : It's Castle. He's on the phone, he says he's got a break in the case.
Beckett : What case?
Beckett : This case?
Beckett : How does he even know about this case?
Castle : Now, is that any way to talk to the man who can ID your killer?
Hayley : Wait, you can ID him?
Castle : - Well, no. But Mia can. - No, I can't.
Hayley : Who's Mia?
Castle : She's an eyewitness. Well, technically, she's a nose-witness.

Beckett : She shared an elevator with our killer, who was wearing a mask.
Castle : That doesn't matter. Because she can ID him by his smell.
UNK: Yeah, she said that he smelled like gunpowder.

Mia : It's not a party game.
Hayley : Okay, then tell us something unique about the killer's scent.

Castle : Hang on. Tell her the thing.
Mia : Okay, how about this?
Mia : There was an old oil painting in that briefcase.
UNK: Boom.
Beckett : How do you know that?
Mia : Are you slow? I smelled it.
Mia : Are you sure you want her back? 'Cause I think you can do better.
UNK: Beckett, we're gonna come down to the precinct.
Beckett : No, Castle...
Mia : I'm not going.
Castle : Yes, you are.
Mia : Why? Because you think I can help you get your wife back?
UNK: No. well, yes.
Castle : But because a man was murdered this morning.
Castle : And that man deserves justice.
Castle : You know, you see your hyperosmia as a curse.
Castle : When, really, you've been given a great gift.
Castle : And with your help,
