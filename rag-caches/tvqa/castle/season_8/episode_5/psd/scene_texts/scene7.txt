Hayley : everyone goes home happy. Hmm?
UNK: Okay.
Ryan : So what was our victim hired to transport?
UNK: A Van Gogh. Lost since world war II.
Hayley : Purchased at auction three weeks ago for $65 million.
UNK: A long-Iost Van Gogh. Sold for a fortune.
Beckett : How come this wasn't on the Internet?
UNK: The painting has a complicated history.
Hayley : It was looted several times during the war.
Hayley : Which made an above-board sale impossible.
Hayley : So it was auctioned secretly in Zurich. With potential buyers bidding remotely.
Ryan : We should get a list of the other bidders. Maybe one of the losers tried to steal it.
Hayley : I already tried.
UNK: The auction house isn't playing ball.
Hayley : They give up their clients, they lose their business.
Beckett : You know what? I'll reach out to the State Department.
UNK: See ifthey can apply a little pressure.
UNK: I think I found our killer.
UNK: An ATM camera caught a guy matching our witness's description
UNK: exiting the parking garage at 10 : 30.
UNK: That's 15 minutes after the murder.
Beckett : How come he was still around?
Hayley : Probably stashing the briefcase.
Esposito : Two minutes later, a subway cam caught him hopping the F train.
UNK: Now, his MetroCard was purchased
Esposito : with a credit card belonging to a Freddy Stark.
UNK: A low-Ievel dirtbag with a history of B&E and violent assault.
