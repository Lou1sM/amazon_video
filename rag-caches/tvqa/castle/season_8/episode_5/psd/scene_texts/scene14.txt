Mia : Next question.
Castle : - What happened to you? - Injured in the line of duty.
Castle : Really? How?
UNK: I accidentally shot him in the gluteus maximus.
Esposito : In the ass?
UNK: Or maybe I should give this to you.
Castle : I'm sorry. This is so not funny.
Mia : You're right. It's hilarious.
Mia : It's hilarious.
Castle : Come on, Mia, let's make way for Crackshot Ryan and Assposito.
UNK: "Assposito."
Esposito : Liam, NYPD.
Esposito : We're about to open this trunk, so don't do anything stupid.
Hollister : It wasn't me.
Esposito : So, I guess it wasn't you
Esposito : who had the stolen painting in the silver briefcase.
Ryan : I suppose it also wasn't you who tried to kill us in that building?
Hollister : Oh, trust me, if I was trying to kill you,
Hollister : - you'd be dead. - Wow.
Hollister : I was laying down a suppressive fire in order to get away.
UNK: I aimed to miss.
Hollister : Unlike you, mate.
Hollister : You shot your own partner in the ass. Blimey.
UNK: Okay. Let's not concern ourselves with who shot Detective Assposito...
UNK: Esposito... Detective Esposito.
Ryan : Sit down! Now. Sit down. Or I'm locking you up.
UNK: Oh.
Ryan : Rather, let's discuss how you shot Justin.
Hollister : I'm telling you, it wasn't me.
Ryan : Look, I get it. You were pissed.
UNK: He jumped you on that transporterjob.
Ryan : Screwed you out of a big commission.
Esposito : And then you tracked him down and you confronted him in that garage.
Esposito : You probably didn't even mean to kill.
Hollister : I didn't shoot Justin.
Esposito : Cut that crap.
UNK: AII the evidence points to you.
Hollister : Which is why I ran from you guys.
Hollister : Look, I was at that parking garage, but when I left, Justin was alive.
Hollister : It's like you said, I confronted Justin. But he apologized.
Hollister : He knew he did me wrong, so he gave me back the painting, and I left.
UNK: Someone else must've come after me and shot him.
