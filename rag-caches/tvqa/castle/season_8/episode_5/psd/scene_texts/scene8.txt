Beckett : - Nice job, Sarge. - Yeah.
Castle : So, Beckett and I have been married almost a year.
Castle : And things were going great.
Castle : And then suddenly she says she needs space.
Mia : - Why is that my problem? - Oh, it's not.
UNK: But I was just thinking, you're so attuned to pheromone output,

Castle : Let me know when I'm being charming. Let me know when I'm annoying her.
Mia : You mean like this? Hey, Castle, you're being annoying.
UNK: Yes.
