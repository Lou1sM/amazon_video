Castle : the police can put away a cold-blooded killer.
Castle : Now, isn't that worth putting yourself out there?
UNK: No.
UNK: And there is nothing you can do to make me leave my apartment.
Castle : - Nothing? - Nothing.
Martha : - Oh, my God. - I'm sorry.
Esposito : - Ew! - Desperate times call for
Castle : desperate measures.
UNK: Whoa!
Castle : Oh. You were right about those tacos.
Mia : He's not the killer.
UNK: Ifword gets out that I authorized a smell lineup...
UNK: They have visual lineups for people who've seen killers,
UNK: voice lineups for people who've heard them.
UNK: But, regardless, we know Freddy was at the garage.
UNK: And he's clearly lying, so...
Beckett : So we lie to him. Tell him that our witness ID'd him.
Castle : And watch him talk.
Freddy : I didn't kill him.
Beckett : That's not what our witness says.
Freddy : What kind of lineup was that anyway?
Freddy : The witness didn't even look at my face.
Hayley : - Where's the painting? - I don't have it.
Beckett : Cut the crap, Freddy.
UNK: You've got one chance to convince me that you're not the murderer.
Mia : Okay, listen.
Freddy : I was at the garage, but not to kill the guy.
Freddy : I was hired to retrieve the painting.
Hayley : - By who? - Tom Gilliam. Head of The Falcon Unit.
Beckett : That's who hired Justin to transport it.
Beckett : Why would they want you to steal it from him?
Graham : I don't know.
Freddy : But Gilliam was really upset when he hired me to hunt Justin down.
Freddy : Told me to do whatever it took to get the painting back.
