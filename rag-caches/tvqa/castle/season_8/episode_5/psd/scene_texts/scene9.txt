Castle : Only I'm thinking more like a secret hand gesture so she doesn't...
Castle : - You mean right now. - Yeah.
Mia : Listen, you're actually fairly inoffensive on an odor level,
Mia : but I am not a people person.
Mia : And I have zero interest in becoming one.
Castle : - Let me in. Let me convince you. - Forget it.
Mia : No one goes inside but me.
UNK: Well, that sounds lonely.
UNK: It's not. Uh... No. I'm not...
Castle : Five minutes.
Castle : If I haven't convinced you, you can just kick me out.
UNK: Fine.
Mia : But you have to be decontaminated.
Castle : Sounds like fun.
UNK: Whoa!
UNK: Wow!
UNK: Whoa!
Castle : Ah. You work from home?
Mia : I consult for a perfume company as a professional nose,
Mia : specializing in primal attraction.
Castle : And yet you live alone and never have visitors.
Mia : I see people.
Mia : I go into the office once a week.
Mia : It's all I can handle.
Mia : And besides, Iook what happens when you leave.
UNK: You wind up riding an elevator with a sweaty killer.
Castle : You could smell his sweat.
Mia : And his gun.
Castle : What else?
UNK: Nothing.
UNK: Bull.
UNK: You're like a bloodhound. You just don't want to get involved.
Castle : But I'm betting you could identify this killer ifyou smelled him again.
