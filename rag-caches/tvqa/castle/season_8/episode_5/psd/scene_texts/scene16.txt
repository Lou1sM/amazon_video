Beckett : - And you provided the forgery? - No.
Lorenzo : From the very beginning, Justin said he knew a guy.
Lorenzo : That's why he went to the parking garage,
Lorenzo : to pick up the forged painting.
UNK: Beckett.
Castle : Whoever forged that painting is the killer.
Castle : He killed Justin for the real Van Gogh.
Beckett : But Justin gave Liam the fake in the parking garage.
Castle : Yeah, so?
Beckett : So the exchange happened before Liam even arrived.
Castle : That doesn't mean the killer was gone. He could have just been hiding.
Castle : What if Liam drove up just as the swap was taking place?
Beckett : - Then the killer would take cover. - Right.
Castle : So Liam drives away with the forgery,
UNK: the killer comes back out, kills Justin for the real one.
Beckett : That's a possibility.
Beckett : Then the question is, how do we identify this mystery man?
