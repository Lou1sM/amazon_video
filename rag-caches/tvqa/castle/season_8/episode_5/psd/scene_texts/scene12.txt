Freddy : So I hacked the GPS in Justin's car and followed him to the garage.
Freddy : But by the time I got there,
Freddy : he was already dead, and the painting was gone.
Beckett : What time did you get there?
UNK: Didn't get to the garage till 10 : 20.
UNK: Allright. Thanks.
UNK: Cabbie confirms Freddy's story.
Ryan : So he arrived after Mia called 911.
Esposito : Which means he ain't our guy.
Esposito : So how do you want to go at this Falcon Unit dude?
UNK: I say we hit him hard.
Esposito : Guys like this only respond to intimidation.
UNK: Is that the way it's gonna be now?
UNK: "I got this big promotion. I say we do it this way."
UNK: Hey, no. we can do it your way. How do you want to play it?
Ryan : I say we go at him hard.
Ryan : Excuse me. Tom Gilliam?
Ryan : I'm Detective Ryan, this is Detective Esposito.
Ryan : We just have a few questions about the murder of Justin Fletcher.
UNK: Tom Gilliam : A real tragedy, but I don't know anything about it.
Esposito : That's funny, 'cause Freddy Stark says you do.
Gilliam : How can I help you?
Ryan : Well, you can start by telling us why you hired Freddy
Ryan : to steal that painting back from your own employee.
UNK: You got it all wrong. I didn't hire Freddy to steal it.
Gilliam : I hired him to retrieve it.
Gilliam : Justin stole it from us.
Esposito : That doesn't make sense.
Esposito : You hired Justin to transport the painting.
Gilliam : No. I hired someone else.
Gilliam : Transporters work on commission, payable upon delivery.
UNK: And the commission for that painting was six figures.
