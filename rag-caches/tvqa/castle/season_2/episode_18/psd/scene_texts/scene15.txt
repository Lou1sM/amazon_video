Beckett : This is a pretty wide net.
Shaw : So is Varick and Downing, and so are memberships in high-IQ societies,
Shaw : but put them all together, and sometimes we get lucky.
Beckett : You mean like Berkowitz's parking ticket?
Shaw : It's not always that neat. You just keep adding pieces

Shaw : Most serials have some kind of indication of violent behavior.

Avery : Chris Doherty died six years ago.
Beckett : He's living under a stolen identity.
Shaw : So, does it say where our dead guy supposedly lived?
Avery : His address puts him half a block from Downing and Varick.

UNK: Den's clear.
UNK: Bedroom, clear!
Man : All clear.
