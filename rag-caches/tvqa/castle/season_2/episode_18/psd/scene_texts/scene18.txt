UNK: Not so much "caught" as "found dead." He hanged himself.
Castle : Another patsy, just like Ben Conrad.
Beckett : He gets away with murder. Why would he write about it?
Beckett : Why risk it?
Shaw : Writing is probably a symptom of his psychosis, like taking a trophy.
Shaw : He both memorializes the deed and distances himself from it

Shaw : tailor-made for his psychosis, one part fact, one part fiction,
Shaw : just like him.
Shaw : Who better for him to challenge?

Avery : 6'2", approximately 200 pounds.
Avery : Profile suggests he's studied our tactics and has prepared for contingencies,
UNK: Man, it's all here. The engraved bullets. The cat-and-mouse phone calls.
Castle : The cipher. Only it's...
