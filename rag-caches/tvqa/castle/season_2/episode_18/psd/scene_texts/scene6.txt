Shaw : He becomes Ben Conrad, becomes invisible.
Shaw : Nobody's looking for him.
Castle : And then we come here, and we find exactly what we expect to find.
Castle : Our suspect dead on the ground. Case closed.
Beckett : Meanwhile, our killer was right here, hidden in this secret room.
Beckett : He was here the whole time and we missed him.
Shaw : I'll get the evidence team down here. See what they can find.
Beckett : He used her cell phone and then he left it on so we could trace it.
UNK: Gloria Rodriguez. It's her ID badge from a hotel in Midtown.
Castle : Probably on her way home from work.
Shaw : Huh... Found a slug.
Castle : Letter etching?
Shaw : No, it looks clean. The other murders were planned.
Shaw : This one was done out of anger. Wanting to be in control.
Beckett : All because I lived.
Shaw : You can't blame yourself for that.
Shaw : How did he know you lived?
UNK: He was watching. At the aftermath.
Shaw : Everything about this guy's profile tells me
Beckett : he was watching at the other crime scenes.
Beckett : Yeah, but the first thing we did was compare crime scene photos.
Shaw : Yeah, I know, we ran them through facial recognition.
Shaw : But he was there. I know he was there.
Castle : He wouldn't be in the crowd, he'd know that's where we'd look.
