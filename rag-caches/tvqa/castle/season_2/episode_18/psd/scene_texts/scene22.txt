Montgomery : Detective, I took that security off of your apartment
Montgomery : and that gave him an opportunity to get to you.
Montgomery : I'm not gonna make that same mistake twice!
Montgomery : Consider it an order.
UNK: Who would have thought that I would be homeless and case-less in one day.
Castle : I know I'm the king of going rogue, but you were right to chase after Dunn.
Beckett : And Agent Shaw was right to kick me off the case.
UNK: I would have done the same thing if I was in her spot. I'm too close to it.
UNK: I'm sure after all this, you're a little sorry you let me follow you around.
Beckett : No, not this.
Beckett : All the other annoying things that you do, but not this.
