Castle : by a serial killer to stifle tourism.
Beckett : Yeah, and it doesn't help that everyone in the city thinks
Beckett : that we caught the guy.
Castle : Speaking of Ben Conrad, what have you found out?
UNK: Thirty-four years old. Never married.
Castle : I'm going out on a limb here and saying,

Beckett : Yeah, well, other than the people that
Beckett : we've already run down from the dog park,
Beckett : - he doesn't even have friends. - The man stuffed his dog.
Ryan : Well, Conrad's sister confirms that he was a Ioner.
UNK: He told her when he lost his job a couple of months ago
Ryan : that he spent his days emailing resumes
Ryan : at coffee shops that offer free internet.
Esposito : And other than Bumpkins, his only other joy in life was the Knicks.
Ryan : Poor guy.
Castle : Jordan said the profile indicated that the killer hunted Conrad.
Castle : If he wasn't a friend, then he must have met up with him somewhere
Castle : where people strike up a casual conversation.
Esposito : We figure if he camped out with his laptop at a coffee shop,
Esposito : our killer could've sat down next to him and they got to talking.
Beckett : His sister said that he was a Knicks fan?
Beckett : What's missing from these pictures?
Castle : - Good taste. - Area rug.
Ryan : - Decent lighting. - A TV.
Beckett : Which means he would have to walk to a local bar in order to watch the games.
