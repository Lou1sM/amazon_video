Beckett : the one from our eyewitness accounts, led us straight to Ben.
Shaw : Which means the real Ben Conrad was being held hostage
Shaw : in his own apartment the entire case.
Beckett : He must have been bound and duct taped,
Beckett : with no idea that he was being blamed for three murders.
Castle : Each of our victims was carefully selected
Castle : for their connection to Ben Conrad, making him the perfect patsy.
Shaw : The killer's a chameleon, changing his identity
Shaw : to get close to the victims.
