Castle : That's the same day Vega died. That can't be a coincidence.
Beckett : Ana, you told Mr. Vega how to get in touch with the man
Beckett : - who got you out of Cuba? - Yes.
Beckett : Alfredo Quintana? The editor?
Beckett : He lied to us.
Quintana : All right, first you accuse me of killing Vega,
Quintana : then you're saying that I'm helping him,
Quintana : so maybe you guys should make up your mind.
Castle : Well, actually, we made up our minds once we saw the $200,000
Castle : - in your bank account. - That's the exact amount
Beckett : Cano Vega borrowed from a loan shark.
Castle : Since what you were doing was illegal,
Castle : he didn't want there to be any record of it.
Quintana : I don't know what you're talking about.
Quintana : These aren't my accounts, all right? This is the foundation's accounts.
Quintana : My name isn't even on them.
