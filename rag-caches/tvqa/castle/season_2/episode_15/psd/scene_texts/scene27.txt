Fox : The truth? About what?
UNK: Your favorite story.
Castle : Barcelona, 1992, only you left out the part where you lied to Cano Vega
Fox : It's not my fault that she changed her mind, all right?
Sanchez : Truth is, you couldn't get her off the island,
Castle : but you did know that he'd rather be there with her
Castle : than here making big bucks for you in the Majors.
Beckett : So you let him believe that she had changed her mind,
Beckett : and to keep him from ever finding out the truth, you had her put away.
Fox : Put away? In Cuba?
Fox : Come on! I have a lot of pull,
Fox : but influencing a military dictatorship isn't as easy
Fox : as getting a dinner reservation at Le Cirque.
Castle : You'd influenced their people before.
Castle : You walked away with the star player of the Cuban national team for a Rolex.
Beckett : We did a little research. He was the chief witness at her trial.
