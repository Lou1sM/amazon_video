Maggie : A few months ago, the Cuban Tourism Department approached him.
Maggie : They wanted Cano to be the poster boy for the New Cuba.
Castle : You risk your life to escape Castro's Cuba.
Castle : Why would you go back to visit?
Maggie : While Cano was down there, the locals treated him like a hero.
Maggie : Their hero. At a state dinner, Castro came over and shook his hand.
Maggie : When he got home, his friends called him a traitor for going,
UNK: said he was a lap dog for Fidel. The same people who cheered
Maggie : when he built that ballpark came up and told him to go to hell.
Beckett : - Did he get any threats? You bet he got threats.
UNK: Bobby Fox : Hundreds of them. And all of them courtesy of Alfredo Quintana.
Maggie : - Detective, Bobby Fox, Cano's agent. - Nice to meet you.
Fox : Detective, could you do something to get those jackals and their cameras
Fox : away from Mrs. Vega's house?
Beckett : I'll see what I can do. - Thanks.
Beckett : - Who's Alfredo Quintana? - He's the guy who killed Cano Vega.
Ryan : Thanks, Carlos. Hey.
Ryan : a newspaper published by his foundation,
Ryan : primarily for the Cuban community. This is his column from two weeks ago.
Beckett : "Cano Vega Must Pay"?
Ryan : The article's about how Vega betrayed the Cuban community
Ryan : by shaking hands with the monster who butchered thousands of their relatives.
UNK: Quintana says, "If Vega's going to embrace the brutal regime
UNK: "he once escaped, he would do well to be reminded of its barbarous cruelty."
Castle : Well, that sounds like a threat to me.
Quintana : I wasn't threatening him.
Beckett : You turned the local Cuban community against him.
Quintana : He turned his back on his people when he gave Castro his nod of approval.
Quintana : If you want me to be sorry about what I wrote because he's dead, I'm not!
Quintana : I wrote the truth.
Castle : Are you sure that's all you did?
Castle : You said it yourself in your editorial, "Vega should pay."
