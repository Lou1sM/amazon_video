Beckett : She smiles, picks up a bat, thinks of everything that he's done to her,
Beckett : starts with the family jewels and ends with the family fortune.
Maggie : This is crazy. Why would I kill my husband?
Beckett : Because you thought he was having an affair.
Castle : You know. How?
Beckett : It doesn't matter how we know. What matters is that you didn't tell us.
Maggie : It was a private matter between Cano and me.
Beckett : It's also motive. Mrs. Vega, where were you on the night
Beckett : - of your husband's murder? - At home. Alone.
Maggie : You can check the security tapes if you want.
Maggie : So, it's true, then? He was seeing someone else?
Castle : We don't know that for sure.
Beckett : I do.
Maggie : He was in love with her. Her name is Lara.
Castle : Who is she?
Maggie : I don't know. I've torn this house upside down looking for a clue.
Maggie : That note is the only thing I've found.
UNK: 2l16. That's the day before the murder.
