Sanchez : feeling sorry for them because they were poor and he was rich.
Sanchez : Truth is, he felt guilty.
Beckett : When Vega returned, he borrowed $200,000 in cash.
Beckett : Is it possible that he was trying to funnel money to the island?
Beckett : - Help some of the locals out, maybe? - Not on my watch.

Castle : - That's, like, socialism. Please.
Sanchez : The truth is that Cano Vega, like all Americans, was spoiled.
Sanchez : When the poverty was before his eyes, it's an unspeakable tragedy,

Sanchez : He didn't know that I was aware, but do you want to know the thing
Sanchez : that interested Vega most about Cuba? A girl.
Beckett : What girl?
Sanchez : He met a lot of locals, kissed a lot of babies.
