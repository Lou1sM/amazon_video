UNK: Came to me a couple of weeks back, needed 200 grand. In my experience,
Wade : if you need that kind of coin, he got himself into some real bad trouble.
Wade : - The kind of trouble that gets you killed. - Or maybe he couldn't pay your vig.
Wade : A guy owing you money, killing him ain't gonna get you paid.
Wade : You take his bling, you jack him for his ride,
Wade : you maybe even bust his kneecaps. But he made his last installment.
Wade : Vega made his vig. We were good.
Beckett : Vega's wife didn't know anything about the 200 grand.
