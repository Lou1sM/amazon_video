Martha : Tell me, Seer, what do I hold in my hand now?
Alexis : You're holding...
Alexis : - A wallet. - Yes! Incredible!
UNK: - Ten out of 10! - What's going on?
Alexis : Gram's teaching me how to read minds.
Martha : And she is a natural. Much better than you were at her age.
Castle : And I'm very proud.
Castle : Why the sudden foray into the mysterious realms?
Alexis : It's a genealogy project for school.
Alexis : Half of the assignment is to collect stories from family members.
Alexis : I had no idea that Gram's folks had a mind-reading act on Coney Island.
Martha : Yeah, they were very famous in their day.
Alexis : I love all their codes. How "tell me" means "wallet,"
Alexis : and "reveal to me" means "a pair of glasses."
Castle : Yes, you come from a long line of hucksters and charlatans,
Castle : myself included. But we have high hopes for you.
