Beckett : Any way to estimate the height of the attacker
Beckett : based on the angle of the blows?
UNK: Normally, yes, but in this case your attacker's first swing landed
Perlmutter : - a little south of his head. - How far south?
Perlmutter : - Enough to make him a soprano. - Oh.
UNK: - Should have worn a cup. - Yeah.
UNK: Lacerations around the patella suggest Mr. Vega was on his knees
UNK: - when he was hit on the head. - So, our attacker could've been anyone.
Perlmutter : Man, woman, or child. But that's not why I called.
Perlmutter : Among all the fresh bruising, we also found significant subdermal bruises
Perlmutter : that weren't quite as fresh. The contusions were all fist-sized.
Beckett : - He was in a fight. - Couple of days ago.
Castle : - What's this shape right here? - He was wearing a ring.
Perlmutter : Not just any ring.
