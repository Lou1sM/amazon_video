UNK: So, Wade's telling the truth. He shows up after the murder,
UNK: tracks some blood outside of the park.
Beckett : While the real murderer gets blood on top of his shoe
Beckett : and leaves little or no trail behind.
Montgomery : Let's find out why Vega comes back from Cuba
Montgomery : - and suddenly needs 200 grand. - Okay.
Esposito : So where do you want to start?
Beckett : You guys look into Vega's financials, see if we missed anything.
Beckett : - Castle and I will start with Cuba. - Cuba! Good idea!
Castle : I'll bring the mojitos, you get the beach towels.
Beckett : Oh, I don't know, Castle. Me in a swimsuit under the hot, blistering sun...
Castle : I'd be happy to rub lotion on you.
Beckett : That's okay. I was actually thinking of something a little bit more local.
Beckett : Like the man who arranged the entire trip to Cuba.
Beckett : - Bobby Fox, his agent. - That's a good idea.
Castle : - But the lotion offer still stands. - No, thank you.
Castle : I have very soft hands.
