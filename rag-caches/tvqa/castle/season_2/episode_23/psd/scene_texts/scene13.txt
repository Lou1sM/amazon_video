Castle : Easy. Lisa's affair with Wilder went south.
Castle : They could no longer work together side by side,
Castle : and she didn't want to have to quit her job.
Castle : Detective Demming?
UNK: You know, it could be anything.
Natasha : I don't know. Maybe Blake didn't like the fact
UNK: that Wilder grew up to be more successful than him.
UNK: Maybe he was sick of getting beat at golf.
Castle : Golf, really?
Tom : To be honest with you, I'm not that concerned about a motive right now.
Tom : I've got an eyewitness that saw him tossing his cousin's
Tom : prize book collection the night of the murder.
Castle : I have a witness, too.
Tom : That heard Wilder fight
Tom : with someone three days ago. It doesn't mean anything.
Martha : - Guys... - At least I have a motive.
UNK: Yeah, but you can't put your suspect at the scene.
UNK: Did I miss the part where you've got a motive?
UNK: Guys.
Beckett : This isn't a competition. We've got two good suspects.
Beckett : Seems to me that we should bring them in and see what they say.
Lisa : Okay, fine. Damian and I had an argument
Lisa : at his apartment on Thursday night.
Lisa : But I was not having an affair with him,
Lisa : and I never went to New Jersey to meet him in any motel.
Beckett : Our witness said that he heard things being thrown,
Beckett : and that Wilder said something about having a gun to his head.
