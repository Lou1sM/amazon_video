Castle : Especially that message. I mean, we know it's murder.
Castle : The dead body's kind of a giveaway.
Ryan : So we're still canvassing, but I thought you'd want to hear this.
Ryan : Neighbor said she was on her treadmill last night listening to music.
Beckett : So she didn't hear the shot?
Ryan : No, but she did open her back door to let the cat in,
Ryan : and she saw someone hopping over the fence
Ryan : on their way out of Wilder's yard.
Castle : You get a description?
Ryan : Yeah, "a foot disappearing over the fence."
Beckett : Did you get a time at all?
UNK: 10 : 52 on the button. It was still on her alarm box.
