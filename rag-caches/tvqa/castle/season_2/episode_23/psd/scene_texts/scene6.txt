Beckett : What we could really use your help on is with the missing books.
Beckett : Did he have a catalogue of his collection?
Blake : Sure. Damian looked to me
Blake : to help him out with the business side of things.
Blake : The insurer he used is a friend of mine. He'll have a catalogue.
Tom : As far as we know, the only thing missing were the books,
Tom : which suggests the perpetrator went there knowing what he was looking for.
Tom : Could be he had an opportunity to case the apartment.
Blake : Well, the kitchen... I mean, Damian had the entire thing renovated.
Blake : The place was crawling with workers for weeks.
Tom : Killed for a fortune in stolen books.
Tom : So I'll run the work crews and see if anybody has priors.
Beckett : Thanks, Tom. I appreciate your help on this.
Tom : I'll let you know if anything turns up.
