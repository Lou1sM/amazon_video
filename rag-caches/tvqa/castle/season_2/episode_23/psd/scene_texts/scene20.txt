Tom : They both killed him, and they both paid the blackmailer.
Beckett : Which means they both had to raise a lot of money in not a lot of time.
Beckett : We found withdrawals from bank accounts,
UNK: money market funds, even 401 s.
UNK: All of it totaling $ 75,000 from each one of them.
Montgomery : They didn't cover their tracks because they didn't think
Montgomery : anyone would get on to the blackmail and come looking.
Beckett : It turns out Blake was leveraged in debt up to his eyeballs.
Beckett : If the company stock had taken a hit,
Beckett : the whole house of cards would've fallen.
Montgomery : - And her? - She didn't want to serve time.
Beckett : She's the one who sat on initial reports
Beckett : that there were problems with the shaving cream.
Montgomery : Poor Wilder.
Beckett : Tried to do the right thing and gets himself killed.
Beckett : Castle and Demming were right about the two of them all along.
Montgomery : Nice of you to give them both the satisfaction
Montgomery : of taking down their suspect.
UNK: Well, it's the least I could do.
Beckett : Male vanity being what it is.
Castle : - Hey. - Hey.
Castle : So listen, thanks... Thanks for your help on this one.
Tom : You know, same team.
Castle : Guess I'll see you around.
UNK: Yeah.
Ryan : One murder, two killers.
Ryan : That's something you don't see every day.
Esposito : Yeah. That's definitely another one for the record books.
Castle : You guys seen Beckett? I wanted to congratulate her.
Beckett : She's the one who cracked this one open.
Esposito : I think she's in the back processing the charges.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: - Bank all day. - Nothing but net, though.
