Castle : that Mr. Wilder had been targeted personally?
Daphne : Usually, they just picket outside the building.
Lisa : It got so bad, we actually hired a private security firm for a while
Lisa : to run down some of the threats we got in the mail.
Castle : Is there a chance we could take a look
Castle : at the information they developed? It could be helpful.
Lisa : Of course. Yeah. Daphne will put it together for you.
Beckett : We'll also need to see a copy of Mr. Wilder's date book
Beckett : for the last couple of weeks.
Lisa : Absolutely. Anything you need.
Woman : Here you go, sir.
Beckett : I cannot believe that you asked for samples.
Castle : She said anything we needed.
Castle : Besides, it's not for me. It's for Ryan and Esposito.
Beckett : Don't you mean Charlotte and Miranda?
Castle : Wait a minute. That would make me Carrie.
Beckett : You're so metrosexual for even knowing that.
Castle : I only watched that show out of the corner of my eye
Castle : when my mother had it on.
Castle : That so did not come out right.
UNK: According to these notes from the private security firm,
UNK: most of these folks seem like average, everyday, tree-hugging vegetarians.
UNK: I mean, so far, the worst any of them has done
UNK: is break into a lab to free a bunch of mice.
UNK: You come up with anything?
Beckett : There are a handful of recent entries
Beckett : in Wilder's calendar for someone named Natasha.
