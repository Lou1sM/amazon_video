UNK: "Her scream pierced the air,
UNK: "falling only on the deaf ears of the dead."
Alexis : - Really? - A little too over-the-top?
UNK: I think you've been writing too long
UNK: not to know that it's "l" before "E" except after "C."
Alexis : - Ever heard of spell-check? - Yes, of course.
Castle : She's got red hair, she's wise beyond her years,
Castle : and she's about to tell her dad what she thinks
Castle : of the latest chapter of his new book.
Alexis : I loved it, especially the part
Alexis : with Nikki and Rook in the aircraft carrier.
Alexis : - Awesome. - Stop it. You're embarrassing me.
Alexis : I do have one note, though.
Alexis : This new character, the Robbery detective?
Castle : Schlemming. What about him?
UNK: He seems like he kind of came up out of nowhere.
UNK: Yeah, I can't argue with that.
Alexis : - He's coming off a bit like a doofus. - You think?
Alexis : I think you should lose him.
Castle : If only it was this easy.
Castle : Thank you for your help, sweetie. I am so behind on my deadline.
Alexis : That's 'cause you always find new ways to procrastinate.
Castle : Or they find me. Hello, Mother.
Martha : Hi, guys. I can't stay. I'm just picking up a dress.
Martha : Chet's taking me to the theater this evening.
Alexis : What are you seeing?
Castle : Wait a minute. Didn't you audition for that?
