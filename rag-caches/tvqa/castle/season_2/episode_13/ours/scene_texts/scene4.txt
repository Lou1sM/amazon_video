Beckett : TSA tore most of them out, but a few terminals still have them,
Beckett : and this one is the closest to Coonan's apartment.
UNK: Wait, wait, no, no, no, wait, don't do that.
Beckett : - What? - Once you open it, then we'll know.
UNK: Could be an alien corpse in there, Ark of the Covenant...
UNK: Or Johnny Vong DVDs.
Esposito : You gotta be kidding me.
Esposito : This is what Coonan wanted to give to the feds?
Beckett : Hold on.
UNK: No.
Beckett : This is.
Beckett : - Heroin. - That was so cool, just now.
Beckett : Coonan wasn't going to the feds to rat out his Westie pals.
Beckett : He was looking to rat out the drug dealer
Beckett : Finn Rourke sent him to find.
