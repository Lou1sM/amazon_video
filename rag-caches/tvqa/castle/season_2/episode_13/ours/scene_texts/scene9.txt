Beckett : Ryan and Esposito will escort Lee to the DA's office via a prearranged route.
Beckett : We'll have plainclothes in place on every corner and mid-block,
Beckett : and there'll also be air support, for what it's worth.
Esposito : Not a whole lot.
Castle : No one even knows what Rathborne looks like.
Lee : He shouldn't be too hard to spot.
Ryan : Yeah, he'll be the one who's trying to kill you.
Lee : All right. Let's go, everybody.
Beckett : Roger on Worth.
Beckett : Let me know when you clear the intersection.
Castle : It's a solid plan.
Ryan : Eyes out.
Ryan : This guy's supposed to like close-up work.
Ryan : Be advised, we are now on foot.
Esposito : Rathborne's making his move.
Esposito : On the ground!
Ryan : - Drop it! Drop it! Don't move!
UNK: Not Rathborne : What the hell's wrong with you? - It's a phone.
UNK: Disregard, disregard. It's not him.
Beckett : - I let her down. - No, you didn't.
Beckett : Rathborne's in the wind. Dick Coonan's about to walk.
Beckett : - I missed something. - Could have been me.
UNK: Rathborne could've checked the routing number,
UNK: realized the money was coming from my account, not Dick's.
Castle : I was arrogant.
Beckett : I didn't think you were arrogant, Castle.
Beckett : I thought what you did was sweet.
UNK: - And I will pay you back as... - Negative, ghostwriter.
Castle : Small price to pay for a shot at your mother's killer.
UNK: Captain Roy Montgomery : - Her killer. - What?
UNK: Coonan said it was 100 grand to catch her killer.
Castle : And you never told him it was your mother that was murdered.
Beckett : There was no Rathborne. That was just a cover. It was you.
Coonan : Clever girl.
Coonan : All right. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Now here's what's gonna happen.
