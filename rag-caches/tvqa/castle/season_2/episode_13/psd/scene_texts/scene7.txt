Forrest : the Bureau has transferred me here to New York.
Beckett : How did you come into contact with Jack Coonan?
Forrest : He reached out to us about a week ago.
Castle : And you signed him on as an informant.
Forrest : - Nope. - Why not?
Forrest : 'Cause all there were, were overtures, and I wasn't about to trade
Forrest : the family cow for a bunch of magic beans.
Castle : - You didn't trust him. - When a case like Coonan
Forrest : reaches out to the Bureau, it's usually 'cause he crossed his bosses.
UNK: And he's hard-up to trade them in to the Bureau
Beckett : for a quick trip into the waiting arms of WitSec.
Castle : - Who was Coonan offering up? - Never found out.
Lanie : Well, whoever it was must've gotten wind of it.
Beckett : And then killed Coonan before he had a chance
Beckett : to deliver them to the FBI.
Esposito : The Westies are a bit like the rogue state of Iran
Forrest : and the great state of Texas.
Forrest : They're not too shy in handing out the death penalty.
Beckett : And talking to the FBI is definitely a capital offense.
