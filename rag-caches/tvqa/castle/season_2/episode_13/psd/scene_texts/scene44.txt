Coonan : - And I walk? - And you walk.
Beckett : Rathborne has taken the bait.
Beckett : Now for today's performance, the role of Johnny Vong
Beckett : will be played by Officer Clayton Lee.
UNK: Officer Clayton Lee : We who are about to die salute you.
Beckett : Ryan and Esposito will escort Lee to the DA's office via a prearranged route.
Beckett : We'll have plainclothes in place on every corner and mid-block,
Beckett : and there'll also be air support, for what it's worth.
Esposito : Not a whole lot.
Castle : No one even knows what Rathborne looks like.
Lee : He shouldn't be too hard to spot.
Ryan : Yeah, he'll be the one who's trying to kill you.
Lee : All right. Let's go, everybody.
Beckett : Roger on Worth.
Beckett : Let me know when you clear the intersection.
Castle : It's a solid plan.
Ryan : Eyes out.
Ryan : This guy's supposed to like close-up work.
Ryan : Be advised, we are now on foot.
Esposito : Rathborne's making his move.
Esposito : On the ground!
Ryan : - Drop it! Drop it! Don't move!
UNK: Not Rathborne : What the hell's wrong with you? - It's a phone.
UNK: Disregard, disregard. It's not him.
Beckett : - I let her down. - No, you didn't.
Beckett : Rathborne's in the wind. Dick Coonan's about to walk.
Beckett : - I missed something. - Could have been me.
UNK: Rathborne could've checked the routing number,
UNK: realized the money was coming from my account, not Dick's.
