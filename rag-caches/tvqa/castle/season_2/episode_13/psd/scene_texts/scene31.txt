Jim : Not theirs.
Beckett : - Hey. - Hey.
Beckett : - Come in. - Thank you.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : - Hang in there, kiddo. - Thank you, Martha.
Martha : Leftovers in the fridge. Upstairs if you need us.
UNK: Please.
Castle : I will do anything that you need,
Castle : including nothing, if that's what you want.
Beckett : What I want is to find my mother's killer.
Castle : Well, then we need to break Johnny Vong.
Beckett : So, let's break him.
Beckett : I owe you an apology, Mr. Vong.
Beckett : Apparently, in my haste, I forgot to read you your Miranda rights.
Beckett : You're free to go.
Vong : No! I remember distinctly, you read them to me.
Vong : And I waived them all. You did. She did.
Vong : - You remember, right? - Sorry, man. It's a rookie mistake.
Vong : No, wait! You can't. You can't do this.
Vong : If I walk out of here now, he'll think I'm cooperating with the cops.
Vong : I'll be dead by morning.
Beckett : Yes, you will.
Beckett : Or you can tell me who you're working for and I will protect you.
Vong : Dick Coonan. I work for Dick.
Beckett : You're telling me Jack Coonan's brother is a drug trafficker?
Vong : He comes off like Jimmy Carter,
UNK: but it was all a scam to funnel money to the warlords with the poppy fields.
Vong : Sure, he'd build a few schools so he had pictures for his donors,
Vong : but most of the money funded his cartel.
Beckett : So, he had access to all the dope he wanted,
Beckett : he just needed a way of getting it into the country.
Vong : You couldn't get an aspirin from Kabul to New York
Vong : without somebody knowing about it, not since 9l11.
