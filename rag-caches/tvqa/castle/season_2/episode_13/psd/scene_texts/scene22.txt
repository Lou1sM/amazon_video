UNK: - Look, Mr. Vong, I... - No.
Vong : I'll take my chances in prison.
UNK: I'd rather lose 10 years of my life than all of it.
Castle : There has to be a way to get it out of him.
Castle : We could force him to watch Paris Hilton videos.
UNK: - You want me brought up on charges? Beckett.
Beckett : - Hey, Lanie. What are you doing here? - It's about the Coonan case.
Lanie : This is Dr. Clark Murray, he's a forensic pathologist.
Lanie : I asked him to consult.
Beckett : I'm Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle, the novelist.
Castle : We've met.
UNK: Dr Clark Murray : Note the rectangular bruising around these wounds here and here...
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Murray : ...caused by the hilt of the knife
Murray : striking with force enough to compress the skin.
Beckett : And as a result,
Beckett : the injuries penetrate deeper than the actual length of the blade.
Murray : He's also honed the blade so fine
Murray : it's brittle enough for bits to break when it strikes bone,
Murray : which is why slivers of blade were found inside both of his victims.
