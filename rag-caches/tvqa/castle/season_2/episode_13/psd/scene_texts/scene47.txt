Coonan : Not so funny facing your own death, is it?
Castle : I don't know, Dick. You tell me.
Castle : Last time I checked, this was a police station.
Beckett : You knew before I arrested you, didn't you?
Beckett : You knew my mom was your victim.
UNK: It wasn't personal, okay? She was just another job.
Beckett : She was my mother. Who hired you to kill her?
UNK: Forget it. You'll never touch them. They'll bury you.
Beckett : Tell me who.
Beckett : No. No! No! Sir! I need him alive.
Coonan : That's right. You do need me. Now, back him off, or Castle dies.
Beckett : Sir, back off. Please.
Montgomery : - You know I can't do that. - Hey!
UNK: You wanna learn who ordered the hit on your mommy,
UNK: you better make sure I make it out of here.
Beckett : Roy, please.
Coonan : That's right, Roy. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
