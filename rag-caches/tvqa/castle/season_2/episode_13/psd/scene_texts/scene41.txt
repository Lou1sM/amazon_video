Coonan : You get Rathborne, and I walk.
Coonan : And that, Detective, is my final offer.
Montgomery : Transactional immunity, Paul. And I'm inclined to give it to him.
Montgomery : Rathborne has killed five that we know of,
Montgomery : including the mother of one of my people.
Montgomery : It's one of our own, Paul.
Montgomery : I remember that used to mean something in this town.
Lanie : - Well? - He went for it.
UNK: The District Attorney is gonna offer Coonan immunity
Montgomery : if he gives us Rathborne.
Montgomery : I hope you know what the hell you're doing.
Beckett : - Describe him. - About my height.
Coonan : Just so average he's almost invisible.
Beckett : - How did you meet? - We were in the service together.
Coonan : They said he'd been killed back in a training exercise in '95.
Coonan : But then, about a year ago, I'm sitting at a bar
Coonan : and I glance across and I'm looking at a ghost.
UNK: It turns out he'd actually been recruited back then, not killed,
Coonan : to do, you know, the bad stuff that governments like to deny.
