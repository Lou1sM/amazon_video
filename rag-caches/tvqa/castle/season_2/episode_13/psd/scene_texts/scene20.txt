Castle : And this whole Johnny Vong thing?
Vong : No one wants to buy a real estate system from a Harvard MBA.
Vong : But show them an idiot with a Rolls-Royce,
Vong : and they'll knock down doors. So I played Johnny Vong.
Coonan : You know, people want all that Horatio Alger crap,
Vong : - so that's what I give them. - Well, that and heroin.
Beckett : How exactly did you know Jack Coonan?
Vong : Look, whatever you think you know, I promise you I didn't kill Coonan.
