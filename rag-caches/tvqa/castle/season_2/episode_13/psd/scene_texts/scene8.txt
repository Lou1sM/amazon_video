Beckett : We need to talk to Finn Rourke again.
UNK: Finn Rourke : An angel visited Jackie's home two nights ago.
UNK: Finn Rourke : Same angel as took the Pharaoh's first-born.
UNK: Finn Rourke : Now I know some of you think you don't know the Angel of Death.
UNK: Finn Rourke : But trust me, lads. He knows you.
UNK: - So, here's to our darling Jackie. To Jackie.
UNK: If he's up in heaven now, you can be sure he broke in
UNK: when they was at vespers.
UNK: Come to honor the dead, I hope.
