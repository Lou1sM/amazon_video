Beckett : Castle, these Westies can be pretty rough.
UNK: So you sure you don't wanna stay in the car?
Castle : - No way. - Okay.
Beckett : Keep your mouth shut and try to butch up a little.
Beckett : - I'm looking for Finn Rourke. - Is that right?
Barman : Well, as far as I'm concerned,
Barman : you and your wife there can keep looking.
Beckett : This is the part where I tell you that one phone call from me,
Beckett : and the Department of Health will be down here.
UNK: You'll be shut down for 30 days, I guarantee it.
UNK: Do you really wanna do that to your boss?
Beckett : It's not like I'm asking you to cough up...
UNK: Go on now. Can't hear the game. Tommy, pint for the pretty boy, yeah?
UNK: Finn Rourke : Settle his stomach.
UNK: Thanks.
Beckett : Mr. Rourke, I'm Detective Kate Beckett. I'm here about Jack Coonan.
UNK: And so you are.
Beckett : - When did you last see Jack Coonan? - I don't remember.
