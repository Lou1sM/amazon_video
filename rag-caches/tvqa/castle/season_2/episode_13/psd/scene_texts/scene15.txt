UNK: It's part of what attracted me to him.
UNK: What?
Molly : You telling me you never had a thing for bad boys, Kate?
Beckett : No comment.
Castle : So, Jack never mentioned going to the FBI?
Molly : Jack never discussed business. But I knew he wanted out.
Molly : We talked about going somewhere far away.
Molly : Last week, Jack warned me he might get there first.
Castle : - Jack saw this coming? - We spent every night together.
Molly : He couldn't get to sleep without me next to him.
Molly : But last week, he wouldn't even let me come over.
Molly : Anybody but Jack, and I'd have thought he had something going on the side.
Beckett : That never crossed your mind?
