Beckett : I am the investigator of record on this case.
Beckett : You had no right to withhold evidence from me.
Lanie : Well, what did you expect?
Lanie : The last time Castle tried to talk to you about your mother's murder,

Lanie : I noticed the wound similarity.
Lanie : I reached out to Dr. Murray.
Lanie : I held off from telling you until I knew the evidence was rock solid.
