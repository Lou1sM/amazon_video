Castle : Tell him he could finally afford that scuba shop he always wanted?
UNK: Mrs Kopek : - Stan, what did you do? - Nothing. Nothing. I don't know...
Beckett : Mrs. Kopek, your husband killed your brother.
UNK: Richard Castle : - That's... - Stan!
UNK: Hon, they're lying! That's ridiculous!
Castle : We have a witness, Mr. Kopek. The squatter you tried to kill
Castle : identified you from a photo array less than an hour ago.
UNK: Michelle Langford : - Oh, God. - No. No. It was...
UNK: Mr Kopek : It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
UNK: Mr Kopek : No one was supposed to get hurt.
UNK: Mr Kopek : Doug, he just... He wouldn't listen. I didn't mean...
UNK: Mr Kopek : Anton, he came after me. That was self-defense. I'm not a killer.
Beckett : We have two bodies that prove otherwise.
UNK: Mr Kopek : It just got out of hand. Things just spun out of control.
UNK: Mrs Kopek : - Get him away from me. - Honey, it's...
Esposito : On your feet.
UNK: Mr Kopek : I did it for us. It was all for us, baby.
UNK: Mickey Carlson : And you guys thought I made the whole thing up.
Castle : I believed you the whole time.
UNK: So, what happens to me now? I go back to the holding cell?
Carlson : Or am I headed to The Tombs?
Beckett : Neither. For your cooperation in the apprehension of Stan Kopek,
Beckett : the ADA has agreed to a deal. Five years probation for all your sins.
Carlson : No jail time?
Beckett : You have a shot at a second chance, Mickey.
Castle : Don't blow it.
Carlson : I won't. Hey, thanks for everything. Really, thank you.
Beckett : All right.
UNK: Oh, man, I can't wait to go home, and just slip into a warm bath and...
UNK: Baby Dyson : - I... - Don't. Please? Don't.
Castle : I was just going to say I'm starving.
Castle : We left the restaurant before I had a chance to finish my entree.
UNK: Yeah, well, it wouldn't have mattered if you did. The portions there were tiny.
