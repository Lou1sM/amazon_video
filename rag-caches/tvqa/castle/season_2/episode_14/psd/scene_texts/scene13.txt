Castle : What if the connection to the Third Man isn't through Scarface,
UNK: what if it's through Doug?
Montgomery : The travel agent? I thought we went through him.
Beckett : We did. We checked his family, his friends, his co-workers.
Castle : But not his clients. Think about it, maybe that's it.
Castle : The Third Man books a trip through Doug.
Castle : Doug starts talking,
UNK: tells him about his dream of owning a scuba shop in the islands.
Castle : The Third Man senses his frustration, that's his in. He tells Doug it'll be easy.
Castle : It's a victimless crime, nobody will get hurt, insurance will pay.
