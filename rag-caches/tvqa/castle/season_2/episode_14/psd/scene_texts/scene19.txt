Beckett : Run all of the paperwork from Du Preez's last shipment.
UNK: Customs, Fish and Wildlife, the shipping company, everything.
UNK: I want to know who knew what and when.
Castle : You think someone at the airport caught on to Du Preez's smuggling?
Castle : Decided to rob him instead of report him?
Beckett : Not only that, I think I know who.
Beckett : Mr. And Mrs. Kopek, thank you for coming in so late. Please.
UNK: Mrs Kopek : Sorry it took so long. Stan was at work when you called.
UNK: Oh, right. You said that the last time that you saw your brother
UNK: was at the agency's party around where Stan works.
UNK: Mrs Kopek : That's right.
Beckett : Could you refresh my memory, Mr. Kopek. Where is it that you work?
UNK: It's late. Could you just please tell us what you found out?
Beckett : Well, I didn't really put everything together
Beckett : until I remembered your wife's story about the party. At the airport.
