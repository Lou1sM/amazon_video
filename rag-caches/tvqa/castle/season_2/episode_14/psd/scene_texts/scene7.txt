Beckett : Actually, my plans for tonight just fell through.
Castle : - Who's Brad? - Hmm.
Esposito : - Must be Lanie's friend. - You know him?
Esposito : Yeah, met him once. Good guy, fireman.
Esposito : Was in the FDNY calendar. Chiseled good looks, rock hard abs.
UNK: And get this, once during a fire, after saving the parents and the kids,
Esposito : he went back in for the puppies.
UNK: - See you then. - Did she just flip her hair?
Esposito : I'm telling you, bro, puppies. Gets them every time.
UNK: Puppies.
Ryan : Yes, Mr. Maitlan? - What?
Castle : - You're smiling. Great. Thank you very much
Ryan : - for your cooperation. - So?
Ryan : Goodbye. Hey.
UNK: We got the Maitlans. We're good to enter.
Ryan : - They're calling the super right now. - Okay, let's go.
Ryan : Stay out here, please, sir.
Esposito : - We'll check the back. - Okay.
Beckett : Well, surprise, surprise.
