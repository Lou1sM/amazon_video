UNK: A pet shop.
UNK: Why don't you come get it?
UNK: Noel Du Preez : I have the largest selection of reptiles in the city. They're my specialty.
UNK: Okay, thank you, bye-bye.
UNK: Hi, how is it? Can I help you?
Beckett : - And you're sure nothing was stolen? - Yeah, I mean, what is there to steal?
UNK: This dumbwaiter's been opened recently.
UNK: Du Preez : It was open?
UNK: Mickey told us his attacker said there was millions at stake.
Beckett : Mr. Du Preez, what's on the other side of that wall?
UNK: 28th Street. Eastside Bank and Trust.
Castle : A bank heist?
Beckett : It looks like the plan was to cut into the back wall
Beckett : to get into the bank vault on the other side.
Beckett : We called the bank manager, the FBI, but our guys never made it that far.
UNK: Captain Roy Montgomery : What went wrong?
Beckett : We don't know. It could have been greed, panic.
Beckett : It looks like our victims might have been betrayed by their partner.
Montgomery : In the old days, you killed your partners after you got the money.
UNK: Any leads on this Third Man?
Beckett : No. We had our squatter take a look at mug shots
UNK: of Anton Francis' associates and we didn't find him.
