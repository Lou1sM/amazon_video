Castle : Oh, you're good.
Castle : Hey, I know that this can be weird for you,
Castle : how parents aren't supposed to date.
Alexis : I know you date, Dad. I know you probably do other things
UNK: that I'm not going to think about and will never, ever mention.
Castle : Fair enough. So, what's wrong?
Castle : I don't know. I mean, I'm not gonna be here forever.
Alexis : And then who's going to look after you then?
Donna : Bachelorette Number Three?
Castle : Slow down there. Let's not go buying rings anytime soon. It's just a date.
UNK: I know. And she seems nice and all.
UNK: But if that's who you date, I mean, are you really going to find happiness
Alexis : with the kind of person who's a number on a list?
Castle : I already have. You're number one on mine.
Castle : Look, it's my job to worry about you, not the other way around.
