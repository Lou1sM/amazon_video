UNK: A phony award letter?
Esposito : Yeah, when they got that and the tickets
Esposito : they figured why look a gift horse in the mouth?
Esposito : So, guess where the tickets came from.
Beckett : Doug Bishop's travel agency.
Castle : So, the cruise was just a scam to get the Maitlans out of town.
UNK: The letter says that the cruise had to be this week.
Castle : - Why this week? - And why the Maitlans?
Castle : Well, unless our bad guys are into pre-war architecture,
Castle : there's really nothing in that apartment that's worth anything,
UNK: except for the audiolvisual equipment, which was still there.
UNK: Why go through so much trouble to get in the Maitlans' apartment?
Beckett : Maybe what they wanted wasn't in the Maitlans' apartment.
Beckett : Maybe they were going to rob someone else, but just needed access.
