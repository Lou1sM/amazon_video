UNK: Excuse me, baby. Oh, boy!
UNK: Mr Dyson : Home sweet home.
UNK: Can we get Midnight from the kennel now?
UNK: Mr Dyson : We'll get him as soon as we're settled, okay?
UNK: Baby Dyson : I'm hungry.
UNK: Mrs Dyson : Let Mommy get situated, then I'll make you a bowl of hot cereal, okay?
UNK: - Okay. Come here.
UNK: Honey, you said you were gonna wash the dishes before we left.
UNK: Didn't you make the bed before we left?
UNK: Mrs Dyson : Someone's been sleeping in our bed?
UNK: Mrs Dyson : Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too, and he's still there!
UNK: Mrs Dyson : What? Baby, go wait in our room.
