UNK: Good night, Amanda.
Castle : - Sorry I missed dinner. - There's quiche, if you're hungry.
UNK: Sweet, or savory, actually. So, how was your day?
Alexis : I had a truly great day.
Alexis : I got pulled out of class and called to the vice-principal's office.
Castle : - Why? What did she want? - You. Here's her number.
Donna : - Her number? - Oh!
Alexis : She's two years from ordering off the senior menu,
Alexis : but here's her number, too.
UNK: Too old? That's okay, 'cause my friend Sloan thinks you're real choice.
UNK: She is 17, but she'll be legal in three months.
Alexis : Hey, maybe we could double?
Castle : Oh? You hate me a little bit right now, don't you?
UNK: Just a little. What'd Beckett say?
Castle : Oh! I'm sure she'll be fine with it. Maybe even a little flattered.
UNK: Flattered.
UNK: I was just gonna eat that.
UNK: 10 : 15. Maybe he's a no-show.
Beckett : Patience, Castle. Hey, have you ever heard of Drago?
