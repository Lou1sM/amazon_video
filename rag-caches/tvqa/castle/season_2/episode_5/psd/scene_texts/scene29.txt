Beckett : he grabbed her keys and went back to her apartment
Beckett : to get rid of anything else that connected the two of them.
Beckett : That's when he found the paperwork for the lab.
UNK: - Nice detective work, you two. - Actually, sir,
Beckett : it's Eliska Sokol who deserves the credit for the detective work.
Castle : The way we figure it, she got the job on the hospital cleaning crew

Beckett : Maybe not.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: - My hands, they're shaking. It'll be okay.
UNK: We told Mrs. Talbot that you have no intention of taking Zane away.
UNK: She knows you just want to be a part of his life.
UNK: - Hello. - Mrs. Talbot.
UNK: Melissa Talbot : Please, call me Melissa.
