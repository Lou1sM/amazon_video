Castle : Well, he probably reminded Eliska of her own little boy.
Castle : She was trying to be nice to him, and next thing you know she's out of a job.
UNK: Yo, ex-husband's alibi checks out.
UNK: Neighbor remembers seeing him come home around 5 : 00.
UNK: Well, no surprises there. He was never our guy.
UNK: Okay, guys, let's put ourselves in Eliska's shoes.
UNK: She's suddenly unemployed, she's worried about making rent.
UNK: What kind of trouble can she get herself into?
UNK: The usual suspects are kind of hard to see with her, drugs, prostitution.
UNK: Okay, well, there's got to be something else, then.
Beckett : You know what? Let's go back to the building.
Beckett : See if there's anyone we missed on the first canvass.
UNK: Someone must've seen or heard something.
UNK: Thank you so much for your time.
UNK: If you can think of anything else, please don't hesitate to call.
UNK: Well, that's everybody on our list.
Castle : Let's hope Ryan and Esposito are having better luck upstairs.
