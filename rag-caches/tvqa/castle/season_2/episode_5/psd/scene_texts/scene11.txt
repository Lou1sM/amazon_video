Beckett : Can I ask you a question, Castle?
Castle : I already know what you're going to ask.
Castle : The dress code for the party is evening cocktail.
Castle : If you're stumped, just ask yourself, what would Nikki Heat wear?
UNK: When were you gonna tell me about the other book?
Castle : - You heard about that? - So it's true?
Castle : Well, it's not a done deal yet.
UNK: Well, did it ever occur to you to talk to me first?
Castle : Well, frankly, I thought you'd be relieved.
Beckett : Oh, don't flatter yourself.
Castle : Well, I mean, I'm flattered to even be considered.
Castle : Writing a certain British secret agent would be a very big opportunity for me.
Beckett : - I was talking about Nikki Heat. - Oh.
Beckett : Wait a minute. A certain British secret agent? Are you...
Castle : If they actually offer it to me. They may not.
Beckett : Yeah, but if they do?
UNK: Well, I would certainly consider it. Like I said, I thought you'd be relieved.
