UNK: Melissa Talbot : Detective Beckett. I didn't expect to see you here today.
Beckett : A clerk misplaced the notes from our first interview
Beckett : and your husband was very kind to let us go over it all again.
UNK: Melissa Talbot : - I see. - Happy to help.
Beckett : Have a wonderful lunch.
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : Yes, I'll hold. So, you're asking about last Thursday?
Beckett : That's right.
Nurse : That was a long day. We were booked solid from mid-morning on,
UNK: then stayed late for monthly inventory.
UNK: Dr. Talbot, too?
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : Hi, yes, it's Dr. Talbot's office calling.
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : Him, too, we wrapped up a little after 9 : 00.
UNK: Come on, we had him arguing with our vic on the day of her murder.
Beckett : It wasn't him.
Karpowski : Hey, Beckett, just got off the horn with the 74th in Brooklyn.
Karpowski : Uniform recognized your vic's name off the blotter,
Karpowski : he thinks from a call he answered about two years back.
UNK: - What kind of a call? - Doesn't remember exactly
Karpowski : and the incident report was never computerized,
Karpowski : but he's fairly sure someone filed a complaint against your vic.
UNK: That could be almost anything.
UNK: Yeah, well, they should have the file pulled by morning.
UNK: I think our vic isn't as squeaky clean as we've been making her out to be.
UNK: Well, whatever the complaint is, I'm gonna need the two of you
Beckett : to pick it up first thing in the morning.
UNK: Guys, I got two words to tide you over in the meantime, "open bar."
UNK: So this is how the other half lives.
UNK: Hi. Could you sign it?
Alexis : Isn't this great? You're acting again, I'm making straight A's
Alexis : - and Dad finished writing another book. - Cherish the moment, kiddo.
UNK: If there's one thing I've learned in life, nothing ever lasts.
