UNK: I am. I mean, I would be. If they offered it to you.
UNK: You sure we talked to 4-E last time?
Esposito : What, the robe lady? Yeah, she didn't know our vic,
UNK: but wanted us to help her with the ghost in her apartment.
Ryan : - Oh, yeah. - You guys a bust, too?
Esposito : Yeah, we talked to everybody who wasn't home last time. Nothing.
Beckett : Well, that's it, then. We hit everybody in the building.
UNK: Yep. Sorry.
UNK: - Excuse me. Sorry. - Pardon us.
UNK: Did you? Did you?
Ryan : - It was... - Miss!
Beckett : She was out of town for our first canvass,
UNK: but the night of the vic's murder,
Beckett : she remembers seeing her arguing with a man in the hallway.
UNK: Well-dressed, mid-40s.
Montgomery : - Doesn't exactly narrow things down. - No, but the pager on his belt does.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : What do you think, Castle? Look like someone we know?
Castle : Paging Dr. Talbot.
UNK: Dr. Talbot : I admit there's a similarity, but it wasn't me.
Beckett : Do you really want us to pull you out of here and put you in a lineup?
Beckett : Because that's exactly where this is headed.
UNK: Dr. Talbot : Okay, this is insane, I hardly knew the woman.
Beckett : We did some checking, Dr. Talbot.
Beckett : Before she worked in your apartment, she also worked at Bryant General.
Beckett : That's where you see your patients, isn't it?
Castle : What exactly was the nature of your relationship with this woman?
UNK: Dr. Talbot : There was no relationship.
UNK: All right, we're out of here. You're coming with us to the precinct.
UNK: You meet a nice class of people in a lineup. You'll be surprised.
UNK: Dr. Talbot : Okay, wait.
UNK: Dr. Talbot : There was a relationship.
UNK: Eliska and I, we were having an affair.
UNK: Dr. Talbot : We met when she was working at the hospital.
