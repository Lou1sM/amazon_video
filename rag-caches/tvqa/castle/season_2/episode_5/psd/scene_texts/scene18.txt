Montgomery : - You clean up nice, Detective. - Thank you, sir.
UNK: Castle's gonna be happy to see you. Have you read the dedication?
Beckett : No. What does it say?
Montgomery : Go see for yourself. Excuse me.
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : Excuse me.
UNK: Paula Haas : - That's her? - That's her.
UNK: Huh. That is one hell of a love letter you wrote her.
Castle : - A very hot chapter. - And she gets a whole book?
UNK: Well, she must be a pretty special girl.
UNK: Paula Haas : Let me ask you something, when she calls you, do you call her back?
