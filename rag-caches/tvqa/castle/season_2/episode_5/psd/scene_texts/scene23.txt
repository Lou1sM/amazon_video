UNK: Meanwhile, the letter's still en route. So, Talbot's afraid it'll connect them.
Beckett : The irony is it never would have connected them.
Beckett : We don't go through a victim's mail
Beckett : unless there's probable cause and a warrant first.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Teodor Hajek : - For what? - For using "irony" correctly.
UNK: Ever since that Alanis Morissette song
UNK: people use it when they actually mean "coincidence." Drives me nuts.
Beckett : Yeah, well, it must be your great grammatical influence over me.
Castle : I may be going, but I'm leaving something of myself behind.
UNK: Castle, it's her. It's Talbot's wife. Come on.
UNK: She's going for the mail.
Manager : Mrs. Talbot?
Castle : Whoa, you're not the wife. You're the nurse.
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : Dr. Talbot is a good man.
UNK: I've worked for him for 10 years.
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : I know he had nothing to do with what happened to that lady.
Beckett : What exactly did he tell you to do?
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : He kept a little apartment for her where they would meet.
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : He gave me a key to the mailbox. He said he'd sent her a check.
