Castle : That place rents by the week. She was killed last Thursday.
Beckett : How could she be paid up through this coming Friday?
Super : Eliska never missed a payment.
Super : Yeah, I found her rent money slid under my door on Friday.
Super : I didn't think anything of it 'cause I didn't know she was dead yet,
UNK: not until you guys showed up the next day.
Castle : Now, why would someone pay her rent after she's dead?
UNK: Whoever killed her must've figured there'd be less chance
UNK: she'd be reported missing that way.
UNK: Look, I don't wanna seem cold or anything,
Super : she was a nice lady, may she rest in peace,
Super : but can I rent the apartment? Should I give her stuff to her friend?
Super : Her friend? - Yeah.
Super : The lady who picks up her mail every day.
UNK: Someone is picking up her mail?
UNK: Yeah, she's got a key to the mailbox, I figured it was a friend, a relative.
Castle : What does this friend look like?
UNK: Well-dressed, early 40s, blond hair.
Castle : - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Melissa Talbot.
UNK: The super said he remembered her
Beckett : coming in the hallway around lunchtime.
UNK: - It's already past 2 : 00. - A threatening letter.
Castle : I've been sitting here thinking what reason would the wife have
Castle : to want to intercept Eliska's mail.
Castle : Maybe she sent her some kind of threatening letter.
UNK: A "keep your hands off my man" kind of thing.
UNK: She gets impatient, she confronts her, and then Eliska's dead.
