UNK: Talbot's Nurse : He'd felt bad about the way things had ended between them
UNK: and he wanted to give her some money.
UNK: Is that what's in here, a check?
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : He told me to look for an envelope stamped "confidential,"
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : with an address from New Jersey from his brokerage account.
UNK: He wanted me to get the check
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : so no one would be able to put the two of them together, that's all.
Castle : - You were helping him cover the affair. - It doesn't mean he killed her.
Castle : When you told us he worked late at the office that day,
Castle : were you telling the truth?
UNK: Talbot's Nurse : He didn't stay late that night. He left at 6 : 00.
Beckett : So the envelope came from an office park in Paramus.
Castle : Is there a brokerage firm of some kind there?
UNK: "Trueway Insurance, Chromo Diagnostic Lab Systems,
UNK: "Branby Financial Group."
UNK: That would be where the check came from, if Talbot was telling the truth.
UNK: I've got a feeling he wasn't even telling the truth about the affair with Eliska.
Castle : - He's hiding something. - The answer is in here.
Castle : How long before the warrant comes through and we can open it?
UNK: A couple of hours, at least.
Beckett : Hey, did you find the mom who filed the complaint?
Esposito : Found her, talked to her.
