UNK: Well? - He'll live.
Ryan : What, no brain damage?
Lanie : If he has some, it happened way before tonight
Lanie : - and was probably self-inflicted. - Good times.
Montgomery : - How's Lois Lane? - Who, reporter chick?
UNK: Yeah. We took her statement and we sent her home.
Ryan : We got an APB on the sedan, CSUs are combing the rooftop,
Ryan : and we got unis looking for surveillance footage at the crash site.
Esposito : You know what I don't get is, who would steal a dead body?
UNK: Plenty of people. Organ harvesters, cadaver-less med students, Satanists,
UNK: mad scientists looking to create their own monster.
Beckett : Or the guys who killed him might have left some evidence behind.
Castle : Boring. How about a spy having swallowed a top-secret microchip
UNK: that the enemy forces murder him over before the CIA can get a hold of him?
