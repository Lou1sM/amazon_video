Castle : The mob-run games.
UNK: Ron Bigby : Yeah, Triads. He did fine for a bit, you know, but luck's a fickle bitch.
UNK: Ron Bigby : He lost more than he had to the wrong guy.
Beckett : He couldn't make enough to cover his losses.
UNK: Ron Bigby : Yeah, that's when he remembered the night I told the story
UNK: Ron Bigby : about my own fiscal emergency,
UNK: Ron Bigby : about how I went to Mexico and made 50 grand in one day.
UNK: That's when I figured, "Hey, what the hell. Just pay it forward."
UNK: All right, this guy that he owed. Did he give you a description? A name?
UNK: Ron Bigby : No name. John thought he was Russian mafia because of all his tattoos.
UNK: Some tatted-up Russian mobster was after me,
Ryan : I could see taking a job as a drug mule.
Esposito : A tattooed Russian in New York City?
Esposito : Well, that narrows it down.
Beckett : We conduct an investigation based on the information we have,
Beckett : not the evidence we need.
UNK: Well, Bigby says that the Russian hangs out at the club in Chinatown.
Castle : Why don't we just go there?
Esposito : The games are word-of-mouth, bro. They don't just share with cops.
