Beckett : Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an interview to get back to.
Castle : What did I do that was so wrong?
Beckett : The one thing I asked you not to do.
Castle : Okay, so you asked me not to look into your mother's murder.
Castle : But look at what I found.
Beckett : It doesn't matter what you found. I put that all behind me a long time ago.
Beckett : We can get back to the interview now.
UNK: Nope, you're gonna have to reschedule. We just caught a body.
Beckett : - So sorry to step out on you, Amy. - Oh! Are you kidding? It's perfect.
Amy : A chance to see Castle in action. Our readers'll love it.
Montgomery : Well, we wouldn't want to disappoint your readers,
Montgomery : now, would we, Detective?
Castle : - Hey, can we talk about this, please? - There's nothing to talk about.
UNK: Well, just at least let me know what I can do to make it up to you.
Beckett : You could leave me alone.
UNK: Yes, well, I tried that, and it didn't work.
Castle : Hey, I could buy you a pony!
UNK: Focus, Castle. Crime scene, okay?
Castle : It's raining men.
UNK: Castle, what are you doing here?
Beckett : Don't worry. We're still mad at him.
UNK: A guy in a tree, Mom and Dad bickering. Seems like old times.
Beckett : How's it going up there?
Lanie : I got tree branches poking my boobs and spotlights shining up my booty.
