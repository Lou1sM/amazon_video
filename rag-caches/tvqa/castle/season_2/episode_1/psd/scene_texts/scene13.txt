Castle : Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
UNK: "Fine"? Masked gunmen, body snatchers?
Alexis : I texted you, like, a thousand times.
Castle : I'm sorry. My phone must have been off. How did you know?
Alexis : - Beckett called. - Really?
Martha : She just wanted to let us know you were all right.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Martha : So, has she forgiven you?
Castle : Not exactly, Mother. But I'm working on it.
Castle : She has agreed to let me help on the case.
UNK: Well, that's a start, I suppose.
Castle : It is more than a start. It is an opportunity.
Castle : She may have built a wall between us,
Castle : but I am going to build a door in that wall,
Castle : or put up a ladder, or dig a hole.
Martha : - You have a strategy? - Be my usual charming self.
UNK: Uh-huh. What about plan B?
Alexis : So was it awful? Were you scared?
UNK: Me, scared? No way. Come on.
Castle : Now excuse me while I change my shorts.
Ryan : - Dad. - No, I was scared,
Castle : but all they were after was the body.
Castle : - Why? - Why indeed?
UNK: "Dad, where are you?" "Dad, are you all right?"
UNK: "Dad, call us right away."
Castle : Your concern is touching.
Alexis : Okay, that one was after I knew you were all right.
Castle : Yeah, but I thought we were gonna go see that together.
Alexis : We were, and we still can.
Alexis : But he invited me to go see it with him next Friday.
Castle : You'd rather go with your boyfriend than your dad?
Castle : What is wrong with you?
Alexis : If you really want me to go with you, I will.
Montgomery : No, no. You tell Owen he has won this round,
