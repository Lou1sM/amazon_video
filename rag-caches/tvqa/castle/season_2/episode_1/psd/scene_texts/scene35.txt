Castle : Would you change this into something a little smaller that I can carry?
Castle : Now that is a big pile of money. But what's money to a mobster, right?
UNK: Walk.
UNK: Guy In White : - Who are you? - I told you, I'm, I'm a novelist.
UNK: Guy In White : The story. The dead man, the roof. Who told you? Who knows?
Castle : His family knows. His children know.
UNK: Guy In White : If he paid what he owed, he'd be home with them now.
UNK: Guy In White : But he crossed me. And now you have crossed me.
UNK: - No, no, no, no. I'm just a writer. - Do not lie! You are cop.
Beckett : Him, a cop? Don't make me laugh. He's barely even a man.
UNK: Cosmo Reporter amy : - Beckett? - But you are a man, aren't you?
UNK: A very handsome man.
Beckett : Richard, are you bothering this handsome man?
UNK: Guy In White : Go away.
Beckett : Okay. Boys and their guns. Am I supposed to be impressed?
UNK: Guy In White : It doesn't concern you.
UNK: Actually...
Beckett : It does.
Castle : Is it just my imagination or did you change?
UNK: Castle, could you get some backup, please?
UNK: Mrs Allen : - Yeah. Yeah. - Quiet.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: This way.
UNK: So, how is she?
Beckett : It's hard when everything you thought you knew turns out to be a lie.
Castle : Well, not everything was a lie. Not her husband's love.
Castle : I mean, sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons.
