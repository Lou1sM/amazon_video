Alexis : - You're writing? - It's time.
Alexis : And Beckett?
Alexis : I'm sorry, Dad.
Castle : So how was the movie?
Alexis : We didn't go.
UNK: Blue Shirt Guy : - Why not? - Owen.
Beckett : What happened?
Alexis : He was playing video games and lost track of time.
Alexis : By the time he showed up, it was too late.
UNK: Sorry, sweetie.
Alexis : And then when he did show up, he tried to act like it's no big deal.
Alexis : Like I'm overreacting. I mean, he didn't even call.
Alexis : Why do boys do that? Why do they always have to justify everything?
