UNK: Ms. Cosmo is gone, so I believe you can go home now.
UNK: Home? No. No, no, no. This case just got good. And I'm a witness.
Beckett : All right, I'll let you work this one case with me
Beckett : if you promise to leave me alone when it's over
Beckett : and not to weasel your way back in.
Castle : Deal. But fair warning, Detective. I will make you change your mind.
Beckett : - I won't. - You will.
Castle : So what's the next step? Victim's family?
