Castle : Do you mind if I take pictures?
Lanie : Knock yourself out.
Lanie : But if any of them end up on the Internet,
Lanie : I will hunt you down and hurt you.
Lanie : So, what's with the handsome robbery detective?
UNK: Demming?
Beckett : Oh, we're just working the case together. That's all.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Lanie : But then again, you have been working with Castle for a year
Lanie : and not a damn thing has happened, so...
Lanie : We had a pool going.
Lanie : I lost a lot of money on you two.
Beckett : Yahtzee. The killer left a print when he closed our victim's eye.
Beckett : Let's run it.
UNK: Huh.
UNK: What?
Lanie : We got a match on the print, but the guy it belongs to is dead.
