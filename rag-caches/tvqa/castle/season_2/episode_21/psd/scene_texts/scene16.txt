Tom : You know, if your mouse finger gets tired, we can switch.
Beckett : That's okay. I think I can handle it.
Tom : Oh, I get it. You don't want to give up the driver's seat.
Castle : Hey, I brought coffee.
UNK: Ah, you know what? It's okay. Demming already brought some.
Castle : Did he now?
Castle : Hey, Paul Finch.
Tom : Oh, yeah. He's casing the place.
Beckett : And look who his partner is.
Castle : That's his wife Monica. She said she had no idea what he was doing.
UNK: There's someone else with them.
UNK: That's...
Esposito : Ike Thornton.
Beckett : If he's working for Racine, what's he doing with Finch?
Esposito : So Ike was working with Finch?
Tom : Yeah, it looks that way.
Tom : I'm guessing he discovered Racine was keeping something valuable in the box.
Tom : He needed Finch's skills to help him get it.
Esposito : But if they were working together, why would he kill him?
Castle : Maybe Racine was right.
UNK: Maybe there is no honor amongst thieves.
Esposito : And maybe he didn't do it.
Beckett : We have him at the scene.
Esposito : Him working with Finch, what his wife said, it doesn't add.
Esposito : Something else is going on.
Castle : Looks like we're about to find out what.
Beckett : Here's the thing, Monica, we're not interested
Beckett : in whether you helped your husband case the bank.
Beckett : All we care about is finding the guy who killed him. Ike Thornton.
