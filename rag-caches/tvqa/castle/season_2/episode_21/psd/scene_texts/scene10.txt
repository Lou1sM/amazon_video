Racine : who can attest to my whereabouts,
Racine : but you don't think I killed Finch.
Racine : You assume I had somebody do it for me,
Racine : so you're here just to
Racine : count coup, aren't you?
Tom : Sorry. What was that?
Castle : The Plains Indians considered it an act of bravery
Castle : to get close enough to one of their enemies
Castle : to touch him with a coup stick. Is my hair...
Tom : - Looks good. - Thanks.
Racine : This item or items that were in the safety deposit box,
Racine : if they're so valuable, why aren't you out chasing down Mr. Finch's associate
UNK: in this endeavor? After all, you know what the old saying is,
UNK: "no honor among thieves."
Castle : See, what'd I say? Waste of time.
Tom : Well played, Detective.
Beckett : Thank you, Detective.
Castle : "Well played"? All he did was deny it.
Beckett : You can learn a lot from a denial.
Beckett : Like what?
Tom : Like Racine hasn't found Finch's partner yet.
Castle : Because Racine would never point us in that direction
Castle : if he already knew who or where the partner was.
Tom : He must want this guy pretty bad
Tom : if he's willing to have the cops do his legwork for him.
Castle : How does it help Racine if we find Finch's partner first?
Tom : Racine's connected.
Tom : He'd have no trouble having Finch's partner killed in jail.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : Okay. We'll be right there.
Beckett : Lanie's ready to fume the body.
Beckett : All right, you guys head back to the morgue.
Tom : I'm gonna go see if Finch's financials have come in yet.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : - What? - Nothing.
Castle : That is so cool.
