Monica : You think Ike Thornton killed Paul?
Monica : Let me tell you the kind of man Ike is.
Monica : About 12 years back, he collared Paul and his kid brother Barry on a heist.
Monica : Ike saw that Barry was a first-timer, so he cut him a break.
Monica : Paul went to jail for five years,
Monica : but he never forgot what Ike did for his brother.
Monica : That's why he did this last job with him, as payback.
UNK: Payback's a bitch,
Beckett : because we found Ike's fingerprints on your husband's body.
Monica : I don't believe it.
Beckett : It doesn't matter if you don't believe it. The fact is, Ike was there.
Beckett : He tortured and killed your husband.
Tom : What was in the box, Monica? What did they steal from Racine?
Tom : It must have been pretty valuable
Tom : if Ike decided to kill your husband so he wouldn't have to split it.
Tom : Split it? There was nothing to split.
Tom : What was in the box?
Monica : A book. A ledger.
Monica : A ledger?
UNK: Something that showed all of Racine's pays and owes
UNK: on all of his businesses, not just his legitimate ones.
Castle : An accounting of all of Racine's illegal operations
Castle : could be worth a bundle in blackmail.
Monica : It could if they'd gotten it,
Monica : but when they hit the bank, the box was empty.
UNK: Empty?
Monica : The ledger wasn't there.
Castle : So a guy tortures and kills his partner
Castle : after breaking into a bank to steal something from his boss
Castle : that wasn't actually there.
Tom : It sounds crazy when you say it like that.
Esposito : Look, I know he was my partner, but no matter how I slice it,
Esposito : it makes no sense that Ike would kill Finch.
Castle : - Detective Beckett. - Lieutenant Holliwell.
