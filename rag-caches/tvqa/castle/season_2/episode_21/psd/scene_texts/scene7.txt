Beckett : I'm sure that Racine is the kind of guy who has his sources.
Tom : So you like our stamp collector for doing the deed on Racine's behalf?
Beckett : Sure, except we called.
Beckett : He has witnesses willing to corroborate his whereabouts.
Castle : - Of course he does. - And we have no proof otherwise.
Tom : Oh, speaking of which, they brought up the CSU report on the crime scene.
Tom : The car was wiped down.
Tom : Other than Finch and his wife, we got no usable prints.
Beckett : And we still don't have an ID on that metal symbol we found.
Castle : Meanwhile, our stamp collector has an alibi,
Castle : and we currently have no evidence.
