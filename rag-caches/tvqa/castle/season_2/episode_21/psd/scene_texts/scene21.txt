Ike : You're a good cop, Javi.
Ike : But I put this down, you're gonna take me in.
Ike : And I can't let you do that, not yet.
Ike : - Not when I'm so close. - So close to what?
Ike : There is a dirty cop on Racine's payroll.
Ike : So in order to throw them off of his guy, Racine dirtied me up.
Ike : And IA bought it hook, line and sinker.
Esposito : Why didn't you just come to me?
Ike : Look, cases like mine are contagious, brother.
Ike : I couldn't let you catch what I had.
Ike : Racine's guy fed them so much garbage,
Ike : they could lock me up.
UNK: And if I had let them,
UNK: Racine would have had me shanked at Rikers
Ike : before I could clear my name.
