Esposito : Hey, he loves baseball cards.
Esposito : Why don't you take him upstairs and show him yours?
Tom : - Come on. Yeah, let's go.
Esposito : How long have you known?
Esposito : Carol, it'll be a lot easier for him if you just tell me where he is.
Carol : So you can arrest him?
Esposito : Carol, he killed a man.
UNK: No.

UNK: Please.
UNK: Please.
