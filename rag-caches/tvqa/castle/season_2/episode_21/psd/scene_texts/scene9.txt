Beckett : A safe deposit box at Manhattan Mutual
Beckett : was broken into the other night, Mr. Racine.
Beckett : It was registered to an associate of yours, Fred Cana.
Racine : You don't say. What's this world coming to, huh?
Racine : Mr. Cana claims that the box contained his stamp collection?
Racine : I've never known Mr. Cana to lie
Ryan : to me.
Beckett : We believe that it held something a little bit more valuable.
Beckett : Maybe something of yours.
Racine : Oh, really? And why is that?
Beckett : Because one of the guys involved in the robbery
Beckett : was found murdered in a parking garage last night.
Castle : Actually, Mr. Finch was tortured before he was killed.
Castle : Now, why would someone do that if all he stole were stamps?
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : Where were you last night?
UNK: Home.
Racine : And I have around-the-clock bodyguards
