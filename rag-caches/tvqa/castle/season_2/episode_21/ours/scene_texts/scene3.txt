Beckett : was broken into the other night, Mr. Racine.
Beckett : It was registered to an associate of yours, Fred Cana.
Racine : You don't say. What's this world coming to, huh?
Racine : Mr. Cana claims that the box contained his stamp collection?
Racine : I've never known Mr. Cana to lie
Ryan : to me.
Beckett : We believe that it held something a little bit more valuable.
Beckett : Maybe something of yours.
Racine : Oh, really? And why is that?
Beckett : Because one of the guys involved in the robbery
Beckett : was found murdered in a parking garage last night.
Castle : Actually, Mr. Finch was tortured before he was killed.
Castle : Now, why would someone do that if all he stole were stamps?
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : Where were you last night?
UNK: Home.
Racine : And I have around-the-clock bodyguards
Racine : who can attest to my whereabouts,
Racine : but you don't think I killed Finch.
Racine : You assume I had somebody do it for me,
Racine : so you're here just to
Racine : count coup, aren't you?
Tom : Sorry. What was that?
Castle : The Plains Indians considered it an act of bravery
Castle : to get close enough to one of their enemies
Castle : to touch him with a coup stick. Is my hair...
Tom : - Looks good. - Thanks.
Racine : This item or items that were in the safety deposit box,
Racine : if they're so valuable, why aren't you out chasing down Mr. Finch's associate
UNK: in this endeavor? After all, you know what the old saying is,
UNK: "no honor among thieves."
Castle : See, what'd I say? Waste of time.
