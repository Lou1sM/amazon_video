Beckett : Too much for you?
Beckett : No, no. I'm just a little slow to get started.
Tom : But I think I'm starting to find my rhythm now.
Ryan : Let's go. Hurry up.
UNK: Mrs. Finch : Ow! What?
Castle : Hey, man. What's up? Showering?
Lanie : - Got it. - Let's go.
UNK: - Any leads on Thornton? - None.
Tom : How's Esposito taking all this?
Beckett : How do you think?
Beckett : I mean, here's a guy who's been carrying his 54th key fob
Beckett : in honor of his partner's sacrifice.
Tom : - I had one of those. - Oh, yeah?
UNK: Yeah.
Tom : But I lost mine years ago.
Tom : Come on.
Beckett : All right.
Castle : Bet this guy does a lot of sexting, too.
Ryan : It's uploading now.
UNK: I gotta tell you, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
Beckett : You know, I hear it helps if you think about baseball.
Tom : So what do you do for fun, Kate, huh?
Tom : When you're not trying to take someone's head off?
Beckett : I'm actually kind of a homebody.
Beckett : You know, the night before I met you, I went home to read a book.
Tom : No kidding?
UNK: Whoa!
Beckett : What about you?
Tom : What about me what? What do I do for fun?
Tom : Or what was I doing the night before we met?
UNK: Seriously.
Tom : Why don't you just ask me if I have an alibi for Finch's murder?
Beckett : Okay. So where were you?
Ryan : I ran all his numbers through the reverse directory.
Ryan : They're all coming clean.
Beckett : That's because it wasn't Demming.
