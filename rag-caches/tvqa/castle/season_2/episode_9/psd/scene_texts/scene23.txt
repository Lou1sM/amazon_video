Castle : - What was that for? - For being the best dad ever.
Castle : It's true, you know. I have the novelty mug to prove it.
UNK: Mmm.
Alexis : Thanks for trusting me.
Alexis : For not pushing when you knew I was working something out.
Castle : Well, I knew when you were ready you would tell me.
Alexis : So, here it is.
Alexis : My school is starting a foreign exchange program to France.
Alexis : - France? - Yeah.
Castle : - You weren't kicked out of school? - No.
Alexis : No, the program lasts three weeks and so I'd miss your birthday.
Alexis : And I knew that Beckett had spent a semester abroad in college
Alexis : and I wanted to ask her if the experience was worth it.
Castle : And what did she say?
Alexis : She said that I'd be going off to college in a couple years
Alexis : and that everything was going to change.
Alexis : And maybe it'd be good if we got a taste of that change now.
Castle : - Well, she is a smart woman. - Yeah, she is.
Alexis : But I decided not to go anyway.
Alexis : Because two years will be here soon enough.
Alexis : And I already got you your present and I wanna watch you open it.
Castle : - I say we celebrate with ice cream. - We'd be fools not to.
Castle : - Serve me. - Chocolate or vanilla?
Castle : Duh. Chocolate.
Alexis : Oh, and while we're eating, we can talk about colleges.
Alexis : I picked up a couple brochures at the guidance office,
Alexis : and you know what looks really cool?
Man : - What? - Oxford.
Castle : Oxford? You know... You know that's in England, right?
UNK: Yeah.
