UNK: When Danton discovers that Buckley's brother-in-law is a client,
Castle : he sends a message, "Back off, or your family gets hurt."
Beckett : And then, when Buckley doesn't back down, Danton kills him.
Castle : - So, how do we find Danton? - We talk to one of the call girls.
Beckett : Call that number and tell him to bring one of his girls over.
Castle : And tell her to wear something sexy. No reason we can't enjoy this interview.
