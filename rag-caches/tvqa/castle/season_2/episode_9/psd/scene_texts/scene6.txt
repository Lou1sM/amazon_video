Beckett : who saw the two of you arguing yesterday morning.
Beckett : - So, that means you're lying to me. - She hates being lied to.
UNK: Paul Cho : - I don't know what you're talking about. - Great. Let's go down to the precinct.
Beckett : I'll arrange a perp walk and you can put on a show for the cameras.
Castle : - Love a good perp walk. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
UNK: Paul Cho : The night before last, I was attacked by a man in a ski mask.
UNK: Paul Cho : He warned me to tell Buckley to back off Danton
UNK: Paul Cho : - or he would ruin me. - Who's Danton?
UNK: John Knox : I don't know, but Jack definitely knew him.
UNK: Paul Cho : He said he wasn't going to let him get away with this.
UNK: Paul Cho : That's why we were fighting. I told Jack to listen for once in his life.
UNK: Paul Cho : - He had to protect me. - From what?
UNK: Paul Cho : - That's none of your business. - Perp walk it is.
UNK: All right, all right.
UNK: Paul Cho : I have a slight fondness for girls.
Castle : Young girls?
Castle : Fat girls?
Castle : School girls?
UNK: Paul Cho : Call girls.
Beckett : Who else knows about this fondness?
UNK: Paul Cho : - Just the girls. - Actually, the girls and their pimp.
Beckett : Whose name is probably Danton.
UNK: Paul Cho : Oh, okay, fine. But I wasn't really lying. I... I've actually never met Danton.
UNK: Paul Cho : I got the phone number for the agency from a friend.
UNK: Paul Cho : I call it and they send over a girl.
Castle : So, Buckley is investigating Danton's call-girl ring.
