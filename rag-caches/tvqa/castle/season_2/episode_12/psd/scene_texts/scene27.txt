Esposito : Problem is, Sophie withdrew her last $ 100 to fly to New York.
Esposito : As far as I can tell, she didn't have the 200 bucks to give.
Castle : So, who paid for the drugs?
Beckett : Forget the drugs. I've been a bridesmaid six times.
Beckett : How did she pay for the dress?
Beckett : Okay, thank you.
Beckett : So, not only did Sophie pay for her flight in cash,
Beckett : but she also made her last three rent payments in cash, as well.
Castle : - Any idea where it all came from? - Not yet.
