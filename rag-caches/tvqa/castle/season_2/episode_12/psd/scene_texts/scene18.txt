UNK: Castle.
Beckett : Sophie's missing earring. This could be where she was killed.
Greg : Hey, what are you doing in my room?
Greg : This is crazy. I did not kill Sophie Ronson.
Castle : Then how did her earring end up in your room?
Beckett : You have a chance to come clean here, Greg. If I were you, I would take it.
