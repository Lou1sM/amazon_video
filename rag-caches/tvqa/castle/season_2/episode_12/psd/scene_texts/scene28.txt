Castle : So, six times a bridesmaid, huh?
Castle : You wouldn't happen to have any pictures, would you?
Ryan : Who feels like watching a little bridal shop surveillance video?
UNK: Is it good? Will I be shocked?
Esposito : Oh, you definitely did not see this one coming.
Beckett : Okay, there's Sophie.
Beckett : - Greg's Uncle Teddy. - He said he barely knew her.
Ryan : Oh, he definitely knew her. According to the bridal shop owner,
Ryan : when Teddy was paying for the dress,
Ryan : Sophie told him she wasn't sure if she could go through with it.
Esposito : But Teddy said, after all he'd done for her, she couldn't back out now.
Castle : Now, I've heard of brides getting cold feet, but bridesmaids?
Beckett : - Did he pay for the dress in cash? - Yeah. How'd you know?
