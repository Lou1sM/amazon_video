Castle : I missed you, too.
Beckett : What did I tell you?
Martha : - What? - Did I or did I not make myself clear?
UNK: Yes.
Beckett : Do you know how much it annoys me knowing what you're doing?
Beckett : Touching things that shouldn't be touched.
Beckett : Yanking on things that shouldn't be yanked.
Kyra : No, no. Nobody yanked on anything.
Beckett : Really? Then how do you explain this?
Castle : - Huh? - Oh, don't give me that look.
Beckett : I've told you a million times not to mess with my chair.
Castle : Right. No, I'm sorry. And it won't happen again.
Castle : I saw her last night.
