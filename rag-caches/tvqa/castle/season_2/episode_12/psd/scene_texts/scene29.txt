Beckett : All that cash means that Uncle Sugar Daddy
Beckett : didn't want a paper trail tying him to whatever Sophie was doing for him.
Castle : Yeah, but what could it be?
Castle : And why was it so important for Sophie to go to Greg's wedding?
Greg : This is ridiculous.
Greg : You don't have enough to build a case against me,
Greg : so you go after someone else in my family?
Beckett : - We're trying to get to the truth. - By hauling in my uncle?
UNK: For God's sakes, he barely knew Sophie.
UNK: And yet he paid for her $ 700 dress and her plane ticket out here.
Greg : He bought her dress?
Beckett : If he barely knew her, why would he do that?
Greg : We heard through the grapevine that Sophie might have some trouble
Greg : making the money to come out here to the wedding.
Greg : Maybe Teddy was trying to help her out, for us.
UNK: That doesn't explain the $ 1,500 that he paid her the last three months.
Greg : - He was... He was paying her? - Mmm-hmm.
Greg : - For what? - Some kind of deal they got going on.
Castle : We think it could have something to do
Castle : with the way she was behaving the night before your wedding.
Greg : Yeah, sure, he paid Sophie to roofie a groomsman
Greg : and then to climb into bed with me.
Beckett : Look, we know how this sounds.
Greg : Yeah, it sounds like something out of one of Rick's little books.
