UNK: They think they found Mike. Come on.
UNK: Mike Weitz : Help! Anybody! Help!
Beckett : Mr. Weitz? Mike.
UNK: Where's that bitch, Sophie? I'll kill her!
Castle : Timing very poor.
Castle : - What happened? - That little freak drugged me.
UNK: All right, Mike.
Beckett : Walk me through what happened with you and Sophie last night.
UNK: Mike Weitz : She came on to me is what happened. Acted all flirty, brought me a drink.
Castle : - A drink spiked with roofies. - Yeah. Nuts, right?
UNK: Mike Weitz : I mean, who roofies a guy? All a girl has to do is ask.
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : - Did the two of you have history? - No.
UNK: I mean, I saw her last year at Greg and Kyra's engagement party.
