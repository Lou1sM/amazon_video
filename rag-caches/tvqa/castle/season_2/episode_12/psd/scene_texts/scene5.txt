Beckett : Have hotel security start searching the premises.
Kyra : You think we're going to find another body?
Beckett : More likely, Mike's our killer, and he ran off after strangling Sophie,
Beckett : so put an APB out, get Mike's photos to all airports and train stations.
Ryan : I'll check back with the wedding guests.
Ryan : See if I can get a clearer picture of Mike and Sophie's interactions.
Beckett : Okay, thank you.
Castle : Or we could watch last night's festivities for ourselves.
