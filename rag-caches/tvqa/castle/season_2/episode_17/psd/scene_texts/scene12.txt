UNK: She's not picking up. Call the precinct. Tell them to get over there right away.
Castle : Tell them we were wrong. Tell them the killer's still alive.
Castle : You lock this door behind me. Don't let anyone in.
Martha : Captain Montgomery, please. Yes, tell him it's an emergency.
UNK: Come on, Beckett, pick it. Pick up the phone! Pick it up!
Beckett : What, Castle?
Castle : It wasn't Ben Conrad! He's not the killer! The killer's still alive!
