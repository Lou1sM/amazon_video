Castle : Yeah, Paula, that sounds perfect. Yeah, close the deal.
Castle : Thank you, and to you.
Castle : - Hey. - Hey.
Castle : Ask me why I'm here.
Beckett : You know, I ask myself that question every day.
Castle : That was Paula, my agent, with big news
UNK: - Want to guess? - Guessing would imply caring.
Castle : I'll give you a hint. The headlines in the trades might read,
UNK: "Castle Bestseller to Heat Up Big Screen."
Beckett : Your book is being made into a movie?
Castle : And you are about to be immortalized on the silver screen.
Beckett : Actually, Nikki Heat is going to be immortalized,
Beckett : - not me. - Yes, well, technically,
UNK: but it'll be widely publicized that you are the inspiration,
Castle : so, who would you like to play you in the movie?
Ryan : Whoa! Are you kidding? They're really making a Nikki Heat movie?
Ryan : Dude, did I call it or what?
Esposito : - Congrats, bro. - Thank you!
UNK: What do you think, I mean, James McAvoy for Detective Raley?
Esposito : I'm gonna go with Javier Bardem.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : Do you have an address?
UNK: Okay. Who is this?
