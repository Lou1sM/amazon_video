Man : Lead just came in now. Let's get it to Avery.
Beckett : What have you got?
Avery : Lab results came back on that bandage.
UNK: It tested positive for formaldehyde and methanol and ethanol.
UNK: Castle/shaw : - Embalming fluid. - Embalming fluid.
Shaw : The lab found traces of formaldehyde at Grand Central
Shaw : - and ethanol at the carousel. - Our killer works at a mortuary.
Beckett : Or he could be a hospital employee, or a janitor at a morgue.
Shaw : No. Castle's theory is more likely. Bring up all the mortuaries in the city.
UNK: We got over 1,000 in New York City area alone.
Avery : We can't hit all these before midnight.
Castle : Can you cross-reference mortuary experience
Castle : with criminal records?
UNK: - Or job-finder groups for ex-cons. - Yes.
Avery : I can try.
Avery : - Six names. Mobilize the troops.
Shaw : I want every one of these guys in our custody before midnight.
Shaw : I see what you mean about him being helpful.
Montgomery : Any of these undertakers look good for it?
Castle : They all say the same thing. "We work with dead bodies all day,
UNK: "we don't need to make more."
Beckett : He baited us, just like with that fingerprint.
Beckett : We're wasting our time.
Ryan : He's on the phone. He's asking for Nikki Heat.
Shaw : - We're tracing the call. - Hello?
UNK: Man On The Phone : Nikki? You were supposed to stop me.
Beckett : Yes, just you and me. We can figure this out.
Beckett : I can help you. You just need to trust me.
