UNK: Castle?
Beckett : - What are you doing here? - Wine?
Castle : So, what happened to your security detail?
Castle : - I didn't see anyone outside. - I sent them home after I got in.
Beckett : What? The windows are locked, the door is locked. I'm armed.
Beckett : So our guy killed the others where they were found.
Beckett : Why not this girl?
Beckett : Why didn't he just leave her in the garage where we'd find her?
Castle : He's changing it up.
Beckett : Or this victim is special.
Beckett : - No, thanks. - No, no, no.
Castle : Agent Shaw said we need to decompress.
Beckett : - Oh, well, if Special Agent Shaw said so. - What is that supposed to mean?
Beckett : Nothing. I just see the way that you listen to her,
Beckett : the way that you look at all of her fancy equipment.
Beckett : Now my murder board's not enough for you?
Beckett : Now you need a smart board?
Castle : - Are you jealous? - I'm not jealous.
Beckett : I'm just embarrassed the way that you act like a 10-year-old
