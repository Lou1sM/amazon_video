Castle : Mother, whatever you decide, I will support you.
Castle : Same way I have since the last man you lived with stole your life savings.
Lanie : Cause of death is multiple gunshot wounds.
Lanie : Tox indicates he had a martini about an hour before he died.
Lanie : Other than that, there is nothing interesting about the body.
Beckett : So, then why the call?
UNK: The body isn't interesting, excuse me, but the bullets are.
Lanie : Check out the marking on the end of the slugs.
Beckett : - After-market factory stamps? - No.
Castle : Those aren't stamps, they're letters.
UNK: I think they're hand-etched.
UNK: Spell something. They spell "Kinki."
UNK: No.
UNK: "Nikki." Nikki Heat.
Beckett : That's why he called me. That's why he said he was a fan.
Beckett : He dedicated this murder to me.
Montgomery : Does he realize she's a fictional character
UNK: and not a real person?
Castle : Obviously he's delusional.
Castle : But given that Nikki Heat is based on Detective Beckett,
Castle : maybe he's confusing the two.
Castle : And we showed Alex Peterman's family the sketch of our suspect.
Castle : He did not look familiar.
Montgomery : - How are we on forensics? - CSU grabbed about 200 fingerprints,
Beckett : a thousand fibers and sixty-odd DNA samples,
Beckett : and that was just from the phone box. They're working them up now.
Beckett : After they clear their backlog.
Ryan : Beckett, guy on the phone's asking for Detective Heat.
Beckett : Yes, I did.
Lanie : Same MO.
UNK: She was shot four times with the.45.
Lanie : There are contusions on the victim's left side
Lanie : consistent with the muzzle of a.45 being jammed into her ribs.
