Beckett : I thought there was a backlog at the lab.
Shaw : I have a federal fast pass, so I get to jump the line.
Shaw : Currently we are running 35 solid leads
Shaw : based on DNA prints, trace evidence found from both crime scenes,
UNK: and we're running it through the FBI data matrix.
Shaw : The matrix also looks for a connection between the victims,
Shaw : in case the killer has a type or a favorite hunting ground,
Shaw : or isn't killing randomly.
Castle : Both Alex Peterman and Michelle Lewis
Castle : belonged to the same Wessex Gym,
Castle : but they went to different locations.
Castle : They were both members of MOMA. Hmm...
Castle : Both adopted their dogs from the same ASPCA.
Beckett : Wow. Sounds like it does your job for you.
Shaw : A machine can collate, it can't think. It takes a mind to hunt a mind.
Shaw : Take this guy.
Shaw : He calls the police to report his own crime.
UNK: Likes to kill in heavily-populated areas and uses bullets as messages.
UNK: Now, most of these stalker-types can barely tie their own shoes.
Shaw : This one's different. Smarter.
Beckett : You almost sound like you admire him.
