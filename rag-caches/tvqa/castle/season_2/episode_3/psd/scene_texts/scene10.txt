Castle : What was it that Teddy was saying about his new face?
Castle : Her picture in every magazine,
Castle : a billboard in Times Square, a huge paycheck.
Castle : Definitely worth killing for.
Beckett : Castle, you're talking about one girl murdering another for a job.
Castle : It's not a job, it's a campaign, a career maker.
Castle : Jealousy is a classic motive.
Beckett : I hear.
Castle : Sierra wants to be Teddy's favorite, but she's always second choice.
Castle : Sierra thinks, "What if Jenna was gone? Then I'd be number one.
UNK: "Then I would finally get everything that I deserve."
Castle : And then one night, she sees her chance.
Castle : She lures Jenna somewhere quiet, deserted.
Castle : And when Jenna turns her back, Sierra stabs her.
Beckett : With the statue of the Washington Monument
Beckett : that she carries in her purse?
Castle : And then steals her shoes.
Castle : Not a perfect theory, but we're here anyway,
Castle : so no harm in learning a little bit more about what makes Sierra Goodwin tick.
