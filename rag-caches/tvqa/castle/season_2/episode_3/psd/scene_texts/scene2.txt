UNK: - but it just kept going to voice mail. - When did Jenna leave the party?
Sierra : Around midnight. I assumed she was going home.
Beckett : Mr. Farrow mentioned that she seemed agitated lately.
Sierra : Tomorrow, Teddy's announcing the new face of his collection.
Sierra : Jenna was up for the job and she was a little tense,
Sierra : - but she didn't have any reason to be. - Why not?
Sierra : She was a lock. Jenna was Teddy's favorite.
Sierra : Oh, God. Does Travis know? Her husband?
Sierra : He's gonna be devastated. They were so in love.
UNK: I went to bed around 11 : 00, I figured she'd wake me when she got in.
UNK: But at 3 : 00 a.m. She wasn't home, so I called her cell phone.
Travis : She wasn't there. I called the cops. They said I had to wait 48 hours
