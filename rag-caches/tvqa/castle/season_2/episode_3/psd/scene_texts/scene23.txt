Beckett : - He wouldn't want to relive her death. - Well, what about Sierra?
Castle : What about Wyatt Monroe? They just go free?
Castle : That doesn't sound like justice.
Beckett : Well, I spoke with Teddy Farrow this morning.
Beckett : Now that he understands what those two did to Jenna,

Beckett : - No one will hire them again. - You mean poetic justice.
Castle : Well, as a writer, I guess I can live with that.
Beckett : I wish I could feel that way. I wish I could feel a sense of victory.
