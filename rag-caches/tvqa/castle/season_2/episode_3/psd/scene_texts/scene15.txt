Wyatt : She smacked the Hilo into a bookshelf, the tip broke off.
Wyatt : I tried to grab it, she cut me with the edge,
UNK: so I backed off and she left.
Beckett : You know, that's a great story,
Beckett : - but I don't believe you. - Just listen to the recording
Wyatt : - on her phone. I'm telling you the truth. Her purse was never found.

Ryan : Here I thought modeling was glamorous.

Martha : I called my agent and told him to pass on the play.

Martha : No. I feel rotten and old. I feel like I'm dying offstage.
Martha : It's a powerful thing, kiddo. To be young, beautiful, talented.
