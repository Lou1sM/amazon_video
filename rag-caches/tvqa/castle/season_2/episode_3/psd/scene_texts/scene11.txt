UNK: And I see just the girl to clue us in.
UNK: Perfect!
UNK: Male Photographer : Move! There you go, that's it!
UNK: Rick!
Castle : That's "Mr. Castle" to you, missy. Rina, this is Detective Beckett.
Castle : Detective Beckett, Rina. She used to baby-sit for me.
Castle : - Or, I mean, Alexis. - You don't say.
Castle : - Actually, we're here about Jenna. - That was so terrible.
Castle : Yeah. Was it true that she and Sierra Goodwin were kind of BFFs?
Rina : I wouldn't say BFFs. Sierra's more of a frenemy.
Beckett : - How so? - She doesn't play well with others.
Castle : She ever push anybody down the stairs?
Rina : No. Stupid stuff, really. Lying about when a call time is.
Rina : Itching powder in your underwear.
Rina : Wait, and this one time,
Rina : she crushed up a diet pill and dropped it into another model's champagne.
Beckett : - You're saying she dosed someone? - The girl got all wired
Rina : and called Calvin Klein a boring old fart, to his face.
UNK: Oh!
Beckett : Thank you, Rina. You've been very helpful.
UNK: Sierra!
UNK: Man 2 : Sierra, over here!
Castle : You got something you want to share with the class?
Beckett : I was just thinking, maybe Jenna didn't use drugs.
