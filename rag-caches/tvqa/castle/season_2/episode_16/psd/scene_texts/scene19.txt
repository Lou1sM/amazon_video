Castle : - You made the team. - No. Try-outs aren't for another month,
Alexis : but Ashley let me take her uniform home to see how it fit.
Castle : And what do you think?
Alexis : I think it's totally not me, which is why I kind of like it.
Castle : It's not you, so you like it?
UNK: Yeah.
Alexis : - because you were bored with him? - Yeah?
Alexis : Sometimes I feel that way about me. Like I'm hiding inside my comfort zone
Alexis : and maybe it's time to venture out a little.
Castle : Well, does that venture have to include pom-poms?
Alexis : I don't want to look back on high school and feel like I missed out on something.
Alexis : So, promise you'll be supportive.
Castle : Yeah, I... I promise.
Alexis : Go, Dad!
Alexis : Move, move, move, get out of the way,
UNK: 'cause Bears are coming and we're ready to play.
