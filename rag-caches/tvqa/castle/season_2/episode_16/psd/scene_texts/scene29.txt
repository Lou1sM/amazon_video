Beckett : Did you know that lip prints are a lot like fingerprints?
Beckett : No two are exactly alike.
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : We found this on a wine glass in Jessica's apartment.
Beckett : What do you think we'll find when we compare it to your lips?
UNK: Lady Irena : That stain could've been there for months.
Beckett : But it wasn't.
UNK: We checked with your car service.
UNK: They said they dropped you off at 9 : 00 p.m. In front of Jessica's place
Kelly : the night she was killed.
Beckett : You were the last one to see her alive.
Beckett : What happened that night?
Castle : Did you find out who she really was?
Castle : That she was studying her clients without their permission?
Castle : I mean, if word of that got out, it would have destroyed your business.
Castle : That can't have made you happy.
UNK: Lady Irena : And you're grasping at straws, and that can't make you happy.
