Stevenson : Venom was Jessica's guide to that world.
Stevenson : If you want to know more about the people Jessica was studying,
Stevenson : you'll have to ask Venom.
Stevenson : Kelly, this is Detective Beckett and Richard Castle.
Stevenson : They need to see Jessica's research.
Castle : She kept her notes locked up?
Kelly : She was a finalist for the Kellerman Fellowship.
Kelly : When you're competing against other people in the department,
Kelly : the last thing you want to do is leave your notes lying around.
UNK: - Well, looks like a lot of late nights. When Tyler was on shift,
Kelly : she'd just pull an all-nighter and go visit him on his breaks.
Matt : Kelly, did you hear how they found her?
Esposito : - Matt. - Tied to the monkey bars
Matt : on a playground in her underwear!
Kelly : Matt, this is Detective Beckett.
Kelly : She's here investigating Jessica's death.
Kelly : Matt, Jess, and I all started the PhD program at the same time.
Beckett : I can tell you were close.
Matt : - I'm sorry, it's just... - Kelly, did Jessica have
Beckett : any enemies in the department?
Beckett : Anyone in school that she didn't get along with?
Matt : Just because we were competing for the same fellowship
Matt : doesn't mean that we weren't civil.
Kelly : Not everyone was civil. In the last few weeks,
Kelly : Jessica was getting these phone calls on her office line.
Beckett : What kind of calls? Heavy breathing. Moaning.
Kelly : Made you want to take a hand sanitizer shower.
Castle : Seems a little immature for grad students.
Matt : Look, I'm studying the impact of AIDS treatments in inner city clinics.
Matt : Kelly's is about overcoming the glass ceiling.
Matt : And Jessica was watching a dominatrix dig her stiletto into some loser's chest.
