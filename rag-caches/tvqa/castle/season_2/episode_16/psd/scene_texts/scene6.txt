Esposito : There she is now.
UNK: - Hello? Detective Ryan. - You guys, give him a break.
Beckett : I wouldn't bring my boyfriend around here either.
Castle : Boyfriend? Did I miss something?
Ryan : So, that was Barry from The Love Shackle.
Ryan : He says the cuff might be theirs,
UNK: but he'd have to examine them closely to know for sure.
Beckett : Well, then have Evidence pull them and tell them I'm coming.
UNK: Oh, field trip to a sex store. I love this case.
Ryan : Look at him following her. Who's whipped, huh? Me or him?
