Castle : Can you die from sodium poisoning?
Martha : Ooh, you have a point.
Alexis : Hey! That smells good.
Alexis : But I already ate.
UNK: Ryan And Esposito : Oh, no!
Castle : So, did you and Ashley do cheerleading practice?
Alexis : No. Turns out cheerleading conflicts with my fencing schedule,
Alexis : my violin lessons, and French Club. Cheerleading's more of a lifestyle.
UNK: And as much as I'd like to visit, it's not really a place I'd like to live.
Martha : I told you she'd figure it out.
Castle : Well, we both learned a valuable lesson today.
Castle : You learned that you can expand your horizons and grow.
Castle : I learned that, if that involves short skirts and boys,
UNK: - I'm not going to like it. - Fair enough.
Martha : Fine. Now that you've both learned your lessons,
Martha : how about starting on the dishes?
UNK: We are gonna need a fire hose to clean this up.
Martha : I cooked. Someone else cleans up.
Castle : Clean up.
Castle : - Who washed the pillowcase? - What?
Castle : Esposito said CSU didn't find anything until they stripped the bed.
Castle : That means there was saliva on the pillow, but not on the pillowcase.
Beckett : You're right, someone washed the pillowcase.
UNK: But the washerldryer cycle would've taken at least an hour.
Castle : At which point, the roommate would've been home.
