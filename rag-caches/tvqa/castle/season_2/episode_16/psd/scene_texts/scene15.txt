Castle : You thinking what I'm thinking?
Beckett : Jessica's boyfriend discovered her secret identity.
Castle : And instead of proposing to her, he kills her.
Tyler : Jessica was the love of my life. Why would I want to hurt her?
Beckett : Because she hurt you.
Tyler : - What the hell are you talking about? You said so yourself,
Beckett : you wanted her to stop.
UNK: You were going to make her study something else.
UNK: It must've been a real shocker
Beckett : when you realized she wasn't just studying that world,
Beckett : she was living it.
Tyler : What the hell is this?
Tyler : This is crazy. You're telling me this is real?
Tyler : You're telling me Jessica was one of them?
Beckett : Why did you go to the dungeon last week? Was it to confront her?
Beckett : - The dungeon? - We have a witness who saw you there.
Beckett : It's completely understandable.
Beckett : The woman that you loved lied to you.
Beckett : I could see how you could lose control and go into a jealous rage.
Castle : And then, in a panic, decide to stage the body in a manner so unusual,
Castle : we'd naturally assume it was someone in the bondage world.
Tyler : I never went to a dungeon. There was no jealous rage
Tyler : because I didn't know.
Tyler : I was going to marry her.
Tyler : We just signed a lease to move in together three days ago.
