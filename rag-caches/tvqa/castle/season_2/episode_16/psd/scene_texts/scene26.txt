Castle : if your murder alibi is a blackmailing scheme.
Beckett : Yeah, but if he's telling the truth, then we have no motive.
UNK: Well, hello, gentlemen, how was your trip to the dungeon?
Ryan : Well, we learned that Esposito's not very good with laces.
Esposito : There were a lot of laces... I loosened them for you.
UNK: Yeah, sure.
UNK: None of the girls admit to Jessica
UNK: sharing any of her clients' secrets with them.
UNK: One of them thought that she might've been seeing clients
Esposito : outside of the dungeon, which might explain the hole in our timeline.
Ryan : But we ran through her phones and financials again,
Ryan : we can't find any record of it.
Beckett : How about you? I hear you have a suspect.
Beckett : Had. Matt was telling the truth. Jessica pulled out of the fellowship.
