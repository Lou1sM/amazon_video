Beckett : In the end, Castle was right. The murder was a crime of passion.
Beckett : The cuffs, the caramel were all just theater to throw us off.
Castle : I can't help but think that if Matt hadn't copied Jessica's research,
UNK: Danielle never would have read it and none of this would have happened.
Montgomery : Well, now he won't get his precious little fellowship or his degree.
UNK: But what about Lady Irena? What was she doing at the apartment?
UNK: Some of the girls thought that Jessica was working off the book,
UNK: so Irena came by to tell her to knock it off.
Castle : They had a glass of wine and she left. She just did it on the wrong night.
Montgomery : Yeah, but why'd she give you such a hard time then?
Beckett : Because she's a lawyer.
Castle : And a dominatrix.
Ryan : Hey, you made it!
Ryan : Guys, I want you to meet Jenny.
Caslte : - Hi. - Welcome.
Beckett : We've heard wonderful things about you.
Jenny : The same goes for all of you. I feel like I know you guys already.
Jenny : And thanks for being such a great partner.
Jenny : You know, make sure you keep him safe out there.
Esposito : You got it.
Ryan : We have a movie to catch. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Beckett : You guys have a great time.
Esposito : Damn. If I had a girl like that, I might be whipped by her, too.
Castle : Now we know why he didn't bring her around sooner.
Beckett : So the two of you don't act like idiots around her?
Esposito : No, so we wouldn't try to steal her from him.
Castle : So, what about this imaginary boyfriend of yours,
UNK: are we going to see him around here? Or is he at home tied to a bed?
Beckett : What's the matter, Ricky? You jealous?
Castle : No. You only get to punish him at night. You punish me all day.
Beckett : - Well, you deserve it. - What did I do to you?
Beckett : Let's just start with the first day we met.
