Alexis : Six, seven, eight.
UNK: One and two, three and four...
Alexis : No. Ashley gave me some of her cheer routine.
Alexis : She's been on the JV for two years and she wants me to try out for the squad.
UNK: Cheerleading?
Alexis : Yeah, why?
Castle : Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
Alexis : What's wrong with cheerleading?
Castle : No, no, nothing's, nothing's...
Castle : I'm just, I didn't know you wanted to be one.
Alexis : Me either. But I watched Ashley practice and it looks like fun.
Alexis : And my college counselor, Ms. Schaefer,
Alexis : said I need to consider diversifying my activities.
Alexis : I figure I'm a natural because I root for you all the time.
Alexis : I gotta go.
Alexis : - Love you. - Have fun.
Alexis : Five, six, seven, eight.
UNK: Cheerleading?
UNK: So?
Martha : The time you wanted to play hockey
Martha : because all the cool guys in school were playing it?
Castle : Yeah, but I didn't join the team.
Martha : Well, no, because you knocked out two teeth in the first practice.
Martha : Darling, let Alexis figure this out on her own. Hmm?
Castle : This coming from the woman
Castle : who just last week told me not to reserve a seat on the space shuttle.
Martha : Have to rethink that.
Castle : - Really? - Mmm-hmm.
