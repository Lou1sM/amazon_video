UNK: Did you ever want to be a cheerleader?
Beckett : No. Did you?
Castle : Not me. Alexis. She wants to try out for the team.
Alexis : - So? - So? You see what they wear?
UNK: If she wants to join a team, why not join mathletes?
Beckett : Why can't she do both?
Beckett : Besides, kids try on personalities the way they try on clothes.
Beckett : It's the way that they figure out who they are.
Castle : What are you looking for?
Beckett : According to the security footage,
Beckett : the boyfriend never left the hospital during his shift.
Beckett : It wasn't him.
Castle : Maybe he faked the footage.
Beckett : He's an intern, not Jason Bourne.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: There goes my Subject B theory.
UNK: So Jessica left the dungeon at 7 : 30,
UNK: and she was killed sometime between 10 : 00 and 11 : 00.
UNK: If she didn't go home or to the university, then where did she go?
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: There's something in here you gotta see.
Esposito : It's one of Jessica's subjects. She calls him Sam-l-Am.
Castle : Because he has a Dr. Seuss fetish?
Ryan : Because he's a SAM, a Smart-Ass Masochist.
Ryan : According to her notes, a SAM pretends he wants to be submissive,
Ryan : but what he actually wants to do is dominate his mistress,
Ryan : - usually with passive-aggression. - Instead of asking for what he wants,
Esposito : he makes a game out of making the other people upset
