UNK: Ow!
UNK: Hey, Irish. You wanna help out your little buddy here?
Mistress : He seems to be all thumbs.
Beckett : You were her office mate, Kelly.
UNK: It would have been very easy for you to access her files.
Kelly : No, it wouldn't. I told you, she was very private about her work.
Castle : You mean to tell me she didn't once slip out to the bathroom
Castle : and just leave her notes sitting on the desk?
Kelly : If she did, I wouldn't be interested.
