Beckett : - I think it's more than just a hunch. - Well, gee, I'm sorry.
UNK: Lady Irena : Unless you have a court order, my hands are tied, so to speak.
Beckett : You're pretty well-versed in law for a dominatrix.
UNK: Lady Irena : Don't let the leather fool you. I used to be a partner at a law firm.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: Lady Irena : When you dominate and manipulate men
UNK: Lady Irena : in every boardroom and courtroom that you're in,
UNK: Lady Irena : this just seemed like the natural progression.
UNK: Lady Irena : It's called Mistress Red.
Beckett : Excuse me?
UNK: Lady Irena : My lipstick. I noticed you couldn't stop staring.
UNK: I'm sorry. It was just hypnotic.
Beckett : It's not you. It's her.
Castle : If you're so upset, we could find someone for you to go medieval on.
Castle : Like him, perhaps?
Beckett : She wants to protect her clients. What about her girls?
UNK: Mistress Sapphire : Hey, you the cop?
Beckett : - I'm Detective Beckett. - I'm Mistress Sapphire.
UNK: Mistress Sapphire : So it's true? She's dead?
Beckett : Yes. I'm sorry.
UNK: Mistress Sapphire : This weird thing happened last week I think you should know about.
Castle : - With one of her clients? Sort of.
UNK: Mistress Sapphire : A first-time client came in for a session, but he left just after a few minutes.
UNK: Mistress Sapphire : I found her in the locker room, crying.
Beckett : Did she tell you why? - No.
Beckett : This client, do you remember anything about him?
UNK: Mistress Sapphire : It was a week ago and I only saw him from behind,
UNK: Mistress Sapphire : but he was wearing one of those medical shirts.
Beckett : - Scrubs. - Yes.
