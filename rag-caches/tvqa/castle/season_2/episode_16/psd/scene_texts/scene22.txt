Beckett : Mr. Caraway, where were you?
Caraway : I was with my wife. It was our anniversary.
Esposito : His wife confirms it.
Esposito : He was with her at the anniversary party all night.
Beckett : This staging was way too specific to be just a coincidence. Somebody knew.
Esposito : Maybe she told someone.
Castle : Maybe someone had access to the research.
Castle : Filing cabinet's not Fort Knox.
UNK: Anyone with access would have read exactly what we read
UNK: and could've used it to throw us off their trail.
UNK: Okay, you and Ryan go back to the dungeon.
Beckett : See if any of the girls swap stories after work.
Beckett : Meanwhile, Castle and I will go to the university
Beckett : and see who had access to her research.
UNK: Okay.
Mistress : No. Mistress Venom never mentioned him to me
Mistress : or any of her other clients.
Esposito : Really? Come on.
Esposito : You girls don't share shop talk?
Mistress : You work here long enough,
Mistress : and the kinkiest things you could ever imagine
Mistress : are just another day at the office.
Mistress : The only time we trade info is if we share clients,
Mistress : but Mistress Venom didn't share.
Mistress : Do you mind un-strapping my boot?
Ryan : - Thank you, Mistress Amber? - Yes.
UNK: Mistress Scorpion. Okay. Getting confused, I'm sorry.
UNK: If you like.
UNK: Faster.
Esposito : Is there a possibility
Esposito : that she may have mentioned one client's fetishes to another client?
Mistress : Absolutely not. Lady Irena beats confidentiality rules into our heads.
