UNK: Lady Irena : Detective, at this time, I'm exercising my right to legal counsel.
UNK: Lady Irena : I won't be answering any further questions.
Ryan : Yo, how'd it go with Lady Irena?
UNK: She's lawyering up. What did you guys find at Jessica's apartment?
UNK: Well, looks like we found the crime scene.
Esposito : Irena was pretty good at cleaning up after herself.
Esposito : There was no trace or blood evidence,
Esposito : but the area around Jessica's bedside table lit up like a Christmas tree.
Esposito : It'd been scrubbed down with bleach.
Beckett : That's why we didn't find Jessica's research. Irena got rid of it all.
Ryan : Yeah, but she didn't quite clean everything.
Ryan : Once CSU stripped the bed, a swab test revealed dried saliva
Ryan : in one of her pillows from her screams as she was smothered.
Castle : Looks like she'd do anything to protect her business. Even kill.
