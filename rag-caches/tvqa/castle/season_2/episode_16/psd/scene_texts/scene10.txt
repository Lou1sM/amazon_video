Castle : She studied these guys like lab rats.
Beckett : But she only identifies them by nickname.
UNK: Ladyboy, Pin Cushion, and Scared Bunny.
Castle : You know, if they didn't know what Jessica was doing

Castle : I wonder what attracted her to all of this?
Beckett : Well, according to her thesis proposal, she became interested in S&M
Beckett : after witnessing a dysfunctional relationship up close.

Castle : Hey, I would drive if you would let me!
Castle : That actually didn't prove my point like I thought it would.
Beckett : You know, it says here that Mistress Venom works in a bondage club
Beckett : somewhere in Dungeon Alley, but it doesn't say which one.
Beckett : Dungeon Alley.

Beckett : There's a whole slew of fetish clubs there.
Castle : Yes, I know where Dungeon Alley is. I want to know, how do you know?

UNK: Hmm.
Castle : You know, you should moonlight.
Castle : Seriously, you would make a fortune.
Castle : Come on, haven't you ever wanted to do something with your handcuffs
Castle : other than arrest criminals?
UNK: No,
Beckett : but there is one hot, wild,
Beckett : kinky thing that I do like doing.
