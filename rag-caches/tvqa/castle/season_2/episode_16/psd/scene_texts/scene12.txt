Beckett : That must be where Mistress Venom works. Did you get an address?
Esposito : Yeah. An office building on 38th.
Ryan : Conveniently located for all your lunchtime spanking needs.
Ryan : All right, you guys look through her notes,
Beckett : see if there's anything that's there that might implicate one of her clients.
Beckett : Meanwhile, Castle and I will go and meet this Mistress Venom.
Castle : Whips, women, and murder. Sounds like my lucky day!
Beckett : I'm so glad you're excited by this.
Beckett : Hi. My name is Kate, and my boyfriend has been a very bad boy.
Beckett : Yes, that's right. His name's Ricky.
Castle : What are you doing?
Beckett : Actually, a friend of mine recommended a Mistress Venom.
Esposito : - Wait. - Is she available today?
UNK: - 4 : 00 p. M? Sure, that's perfect. - No.
Beckett : Thank you.
Castle : Okay, that's very funny. Now call her back.
UNK: Uh-uh, Castle, this is the perfect way to get Venom without tipping our hand.
Beckett : What's the matter, Castle? You afraid of a little role play?
Castle : Yeah, you better run.
Castle : This place looks like a law firm.
UNK: What'd you think it was going to be? Torture wheels and women in corsets?
Castle : - Well, yeah. - That's in the back.
Receptionist : Welcome to Lady Irena's House of Pain.
Receptionist : How can I serve you?

UNK: You see what I have to deal with?
