Beckett : So, you didn't see a stack of paperwork?
Danielle : No. I would've noticed that. Maybe she took them up to school.
Castle : No, it wasn't there either.
Danielle : Are you sure Matt's telling the truth?
Castle : Most people lie to avoid suspicion,
Castle : not a lot of people lie to incriminate themselves.
Beckett : That night that you came home,
Beckett : did you notice anything different or out of place?
Danielle : Now that you mention it, I did find something odd.
UNK: Earlier today I was emptying the dishwasher
Danielle : and I found a wine glass with lipstick on it.
Danielle : Didn't seem like Jessica's shade, and it wasn't one of mine.
UNK: I put it aside to hand wash it later.
Beckett : Recognize this shade?
Castle : If I'm not mistaken, and I rarely am, that's Mistress Red.
