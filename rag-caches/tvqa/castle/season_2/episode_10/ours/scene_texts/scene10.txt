Castle : I know.
Alexis : I just really wanted to get those pictures back to the victim's family.
Alexis : I mean, I'd want them if they were pictures that you'd carried around.
Castle : If you're imagining a scenario where I am no longer here,
UNK: and watching over your every move, and protecting you from every danger,
Castle : I can assure you that will never happen.
Alexis : - I'm just saying I think it's important. - No, you're right.
Castle : But remember, there's a reason why a lot of this stuff goes unclaimed.
Alexis : I guess I just need to focus on cataloging for the rest of my time here.
Castle : And before you know it,
Castle : you'll be retired from law enforcement and back in the 11 th grade.
Alexis : - Thanks, Dad. - For what? You're welcome.
Alexis : You just gave me a new lead.
Castle : So, I'll finish your cocoa.
