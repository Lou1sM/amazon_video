UNK: Sarah Reed : No. At the time, I just dismissed it. But now...
UNK: Sarah Reed : It makes me wonder if I'm the only person in the whole situation
UNK: Sarah Reed : who didn't know what was really going on.
UNK: Sarah Reed : Silver hybrid.
Castle : I guess Helen did know about her husband's affair.
Beckett : That'd be a pretty strong motive.
UNK: Helen Parker : You came all this way because she told you some crazy story
UNK: Helen Parker : about me being parked outside the apartment.
Beckett : Mrs. Parker, we have to take every lead seriously.
UNK: Helen Parker : Did you ever think that maybe she made this up
UNK: Helen Parker : to take the attention off of herself?
Castle : - She was specific about your car. - A silver hybrid?
UNK: Helen Parker : That's like saying somebody was wearing black shoes.
Beckett : That still doesn't answer the question.
UNK: No.
