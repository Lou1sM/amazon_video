Ryan : Maybe it was a pride thing.
Castle : Yeah, but you factor in the sublet, not to mention gas,
Castle : that's a high price to pay for pride.
Beckett : Yeah, well, never underestimate the fragility of the male ego.
Ryan : - See, that's just a stereotype... - Don't. Don't. That's...
UNK: She is baiting us, all right.
Castle : Just ignore her, and she'll lose her witchy powers.
Beckett : You wish. All right, let's go off to Parker's office.

Castle : - I was looking. - Yeah.
UNK: Yeah?
Ryan : For the record, I did not.
Castle : I don't know. Maybe I should've seen it.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : His resume was almost too good to be true.
UNK: Top of his class at Berkeley, Stanford Business School.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : He must've really needed this job to lie so bad.
Castle : So, there's no other reason you can think of as to why he lied?
Alexis : - No. - When you hired him,
Beckett : did you look into any of his references?

UNK: Lance Carlberg : And I got nothing but glowing recommendations.
Castle : For a guy who didn't exist.
Beckett : I'd like to take a look at a copy of his resume, if you still have it.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : I'll have human resources e-mail it over to you.
Beckett : Before we go, did you know
Beckett : that Mr. Parker was romantically involved with one of your employees?
UNK: Lance Carlberg : Sarah, yeah, she's one of my best engineers.
