Beckett : We just don't have the proof yet.
UNK: Obviously, no one wants to get to the bottom of this more than I do,
UNK: Lance Carlberg : so you'll have our complete cooperation.
Castle : What do you think Connecticut Solutions was after?
UNK: Lance Carlberg : Well, it's our battery recycling technology.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : I'm sure you both know you're not supposed to dump
UNK: Lance Carlberg : your batteries in with your trash.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : Now batteries need to be disposed of properly,
UNK: Lance Carlberg : or else the acids and the heavy metals will leach out...
Castle : - And get into the water table. - Exactly, yes.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : The problem is, storing battery sludge can be quite expensive.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : But we've figured out a way to actually recycle the stuff.
Castle : So when you bid on a contract to haul away old batteries,
Castle : you can do it cheaper.
Beckett : Which is why Connecticut Solutions lost half of its market share to you.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : Bottom line is they can't compete.
Castle : Was Sarah Reed on the team of engineers
Castle : - that developed that technology? - Yeah. That's right.
Castle : That's probably why Sam Parker went out of his way to romance her.
Castle : For access. It's pretty smart.
UNK: Lance Carlberg : Pardon me, but don't you mean despicable?
Castle : The two aren't mutually exclusive.
Beckett : Would you mind if our forensic IT team
Beckett : took a look at Sarah's computer
UNK: and Sam's, Jake's, as well?
Beckett : They should be able to tell us whether your security was compromised,
