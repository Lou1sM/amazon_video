Castle : He knew you were more than just a flirty engineer.
Beckett : He played along not to arouse suspicion,
Beckett : but I think you already knew that.
Beckett : You knew that he made you, and that he found the secret method.
Beckett : And that's why you killed him.
UNK: but there's one problem.
Ryan : The night Sam was killed, I was at my daughter's recital,
UNK: Laura Branston sarah Reed : and there's about 20 other parents that can vouch for that.
Castle : I like her,
Castle : for the murder.
Castle : See that crazy look in her eye? That's crazy killer look.
Esposito : Yo. Sarah's alibi checks out.
Esposito : Dance teacher puts her in the front row at the time of the murder.
Castle : She's still got crazy eyes.
Beckett : He never loved her, she never loved him,
Beckett : and they both thought that they were playing each other.
Ryan : Which still doesn't explain who killed him.
Beckett : We're missing something.
Castle : The pen. If Sarah's relationship with Sam was a fake...
Beckett : Then why did she give him her grandfather's special pen?
Castle : And what was Sarah really looking for in Sam's office last night?
Beckett : Nothing. This doesn't make any sense. We went through Sarah's purse.
Beckett : If there was something in it, we would have found it.
Beckett : - Castle, what are you doing? - I'm writing a scene.
Castle : Let's say Sarah found what it was she was looking for.
Castle : She had it in her hand.
Castle : That's when she would've heard Helen coming out of the house.
