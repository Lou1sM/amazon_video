UNK: Helen Parker : In the six months Sam had the apartment,
UNK: Helen Parker : I never went there.
Castle : You never popped down just once for a date night?
Alexis : I mean, Connecticut's not that far a drive.
UNK: Helen Parker : Well, when you have two children under the age of 10,
UNK: Helen Parker : popping down for date night midweek is nearly impossible.
UNK: Helen Parker : Sam only came home every weekend, and I would see him then.
Beckett : Okay. Well, we just needed to check.
Beckett : It's possible that Miss Reed was mistaken.
UNK: Helen Parker : Did it ever occur to you
UNK: Helen Parker : that maybe she was the one that knew he was lying?
Beckett : We're considering every scenario.
UNK: Helen Parker : We got a lot of hang-ups last month. Do you think that's a coincidence?
Beckett : Did you tell Sam about it?
UNK: Helen Parker : I did. He said it was telemarketers, but it was her.
Beckett : How can you be sure?
UNK: I know she has our phone number. She's called since Sam was killed.
Castle : Sarah called you?
UNK: Helen Parker : She called about the funeral details. Can you believe that?
UNK: Helen Parker : If she thinks she's gonna show her face here, she's sadly mistaken.
Beckett : Was that the only time you heard from Sarah?
UNK: No. She called this morning and left some ridiculous message
UNK: Helen Parker : about getting things back from Sam that she had given him.
