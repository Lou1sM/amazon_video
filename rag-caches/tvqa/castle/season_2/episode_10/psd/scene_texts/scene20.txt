Castle : Was she leaving the building?
UNK: Sarah Reed : No. She was sitting in her car across the street.
Beckett : - And you're sure it was Helen Parker? - I'm sure of it now.
Castle : A positive identification from all the way across the street in a car?
UNK: Sarah Reed : I made a note of it because the way she was staring at me was creepy.
UNK: Sarah Reed : Like she was sizing me up.
Beckett : Miss Reed, the past 24 hours have been overwhelming, to say the least.
Castle : It's not uncommon
Castle : for witnesses' memories to be confused after a traumatic event.
Beckett : - We just need to be absolutely sure. - Look, I know what I saw.
UNK: Sarah Reed : She was sitting in a silver hybrid staring at the front of the building.
