UNK: Out of the car, you.
Esposito : Come on, let me see your hands. Turn around.
Castle : You know, Detective Beckett here didn't think we could con a con artist.
Castle : But I told her you just weren't that smart.
Castle : You did, after all, fall for the oldest con in the book.
Castle : The Lazy Susan.
UNK: "The Lazy Susan"?
Castle : It's either that or the Grumpy Beaver. I always get them mixed up.
UNK: Detective!
Beckett : Thank you so much for your help.
UNK: Absolutely. It's my job to protect our clients.
Castle : Wow, whoa, hang on a second.
Castle : I thought you said you hated con movies.
Beckett : Oh, Castle, you are such an easy mark, aren't you?
Ryan : Hey, I got something.
Castle : When you see how it's done, it really takes the magic out of it.
UNK: Detective?
UNK: Is Steven really dead?
Beckett : I'm afraid so.
UNK: Elise Finnegan : Then it was all a lie.
Beckett : No, Elise. You need to know that Steven loved you very much.
Beckett : He changed his ways because you made him want to be a better man.
Martha : Thank you.
Castle : - No hot date tonight? - No, just the paperwork.
Castle : One of the many reasons I'm glad I'm not actually a cop.
UNK: Uh-huh.
Castle : - Have a good one. - Yeah, you, too.
UNK: Aha!
Beckett : Castle, what are you doing here?
Castle : - I knew you were reading it. - I...
Castle : - It's on page 105, by the way. - What?
Castle : That sex scene you're looking for. And Agent Gray was right. It's steamy.
UNK: Gerry Finnegan : - I wasn't... - See you tomorrow.
Castle : - Wait, who's getting a lesson? - Gram.
UNK: Very good. Very good.
UNK: - That's nice. Yeah?
Dylan : Very nice.
UNK: You really have to have good posture.
Castle : I'm sorry for how I acted.
Castle : There's no one in the world I trust more than I trust you.
Castle : And I'm gonna try to be more respectful.
Castle : Just promise me one thing?
Castle : Be patient with me.
Castle : I've never had a teenage daughter before.
Alexis : - Deal. - Thanks.
Alexis : Aren't you worried about Dylan's intentions towards Gram?
Castle : I'm hoping they involve running away together, but I'm not that lucky.
Castle : Speaking of running away, how about we have dinner out?
Alexis : - Yes. Please. - Thank you.
UNK: Okay, come on.
