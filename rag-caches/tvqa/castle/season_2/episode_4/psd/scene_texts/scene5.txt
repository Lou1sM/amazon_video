Castle : High in fat and protein.
Castle : Basically, it's beef and grease kind of melted together into a jerky.
UNK: You'd think it'd be disgusting but it's surprisingly...
Castle : I'll fill you in later.
UNK: When was the last time you saw Mr. Fletcher?
UNK: He came by the school two weeks ago
UNK: to pick up a stack of letters the kids wrote to him for his trip.
UNK: He was supposed to get on a plane to Greenland the next day.
Ryan : We got an ID on the building, 79th and Amsterdam.
Beckett : Right. Tell Lanie that we'll meet her there.
Ryan : Uniforms said the door was unlocked when they got here.
Ryan : - Either the victim left it that way or... - Or the killer had a key.
Beckett : All right. Talk to the neighbors. See if Fletcher had any regular visitors.
Beckett : But first, I'm thinking our vic might've been a squirrel.
UNK: - Mmm. I'll check the bedroom. - I'm sorry, "a squirrel"?
Beckett : Likes to hide his nuts for the winter.
Castle : - And by "nuts," you mean... - Valuables, secrets.
Beckett : Anything a guy living a lie wouldn't want someone to find.
Castle : Oh, yeah.
UNK: - But with, like, a winterland twist. - Hmm.
Beckett : Lanie, what do we got?
Lanie : Victim was shot once in the face with a large caliber bullet.
UNK: Ouch.
Lanie : Oh, I don't think he felt much with a bullet that size.
Beckett : Face shots usually indicate a deep anger in the shooter.
Beckett : Literally trying to erase what makes the victim a person.
Castle : Well, con men do leave a wake of angry people.
Beckett : It's amazing that this is all it took to fake two weeks in the Arctic.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Castle : The wonders of modern technology.
Castle : A lot of criminals today don't take advantage.
Castle : I blame the parents.
Castle : I'll give this to Fletcher, he did do his homework.
UNK: Oh!
Castle : This is a library book.
Castle : Something tells me he wasn't planning on returning it.
