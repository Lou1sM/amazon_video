UNK: Gerry Finnegan : So I never said a word about it to anybody.
UNK: Gerry Finnegan : And then when you showed up here yesterday, I...
UNK: Gerry Finnegan : I just couldn't tell Elise.
Beckett : The private investigator that you hired, did he take any photographs?
UNK: Gerry Finnegan : Yes. He followed Steven for a week.
UNK: Gerry Finnegan : He offered me the photos,
UNK: but I said I didn't want them in the house where Elise might see them.
Castle : What are you thinking?
Beckett : That Fletcher's killer might be in one of those photographs.
Castle : You think it's possible that Fletcher was telling Gerry the truth?
Beckett : That he's suddenly a con man with a heart of gold?
Beckett : No, that's just another con.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Castle : - You don't think people can change? - No.
Beckett : I've seen too many repeat offenders to believe for one second
Beckett : that a guy who promises never to beat his wife again actually won't.
Castle : - That's a pretty bleak attitude. - Not bleak. Realistic.
