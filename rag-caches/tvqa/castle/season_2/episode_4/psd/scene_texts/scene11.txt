Martha : Oh, Dylan had a cancellation. Alexis begged him to let her take the slot.
Beckett : - What are you doing? - Nothing.
Castle : - Why'd it just get so quiet? - Maybe he's teaching her something.
Castle : - Maybe he's filling her head full of lies. - What are you talking about?
Castle : All right, that's it. I'm going up.
UNK: Oh.
Alexis : So, when I start the piece, should it be up-bow?
Dylan : - Yeah, I would. - Okay.
Castle : Hey, you guys. I had no idea you were even here.
Dylan : Well, she's a very talented girl and a real hard worker.
Dylan : and we'll take another stab at Brahms next week.
Alexis : - Okay. Great. - All right. Have a good night.
Castle : You, too.
Martha : - Night, Dylan. - Bye.
