Beckett : You have a guy in the CIA?
UNK: When are you going to learn? I've got a guy everywhere.
Castle : Thai food is pleasing to the tongue.
UNK: It's secret code.
Castle : He'll call me back.
Castle : Now, this guy was invaluable for the really hard-core secret agent stuff.
Castle : This guy is a machine.
Castle : I've interviewed serial killers, hit men. Agent Gray...
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Castle : By far the deadliest man I've ever met.
Castle : He once killed a North Korean agent with a melon baller.
UNK: It was an ice-cream scoop, Castle.
UNK: Agent Gray : And that information was supposed to remain private.
UNK: Sorry.
Beckett : Agent Gray. Not quite what I pictured based on Castle's description.
UNK: I live in a world where nothing is as it seems, Detective.
UNK: For good reason.
UNK: Transparency gets you killed.
