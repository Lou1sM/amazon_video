Beckett : - It's Fletcher, right? - Honestly, I'm not 100% sure.
Lanie : His prints match the ones found at the apartment.
Lanie : But we never got a fingerprint match on his real identity,
Lanie : so I have nothing else to compare it to.
Lanie : Plus, Fletcher has seven known identities,
Lanie : and so far I haven't found a single one that went to the dentist,
Lanie : so I have no dental records to compare.
Beckett : Okay, bottom line?
UNK: This body could or could not be a man whose alias is Steven Fletcher.
Beckett : - But we saw him die. - Or did we?
Beckett : I hate this case.
Castle : I know. Isn't it great?
