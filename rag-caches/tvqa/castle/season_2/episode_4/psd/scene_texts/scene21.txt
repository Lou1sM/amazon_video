UNK: Wait. How did you get a copy of the book?
Beckett : Look, can you just tell us that Fletcher wasn't a spook
Beckett : so we can get on with the case?
UNK: Agent Gray : Not here.
UNK: Agent Gray : Get out.
UNK: Agent Gray : Officially, I am not at liberty to confirm or deny
UNK: Agent Gray : whether anyone is an agent.
UNK: Agent Gray : But unofficially,
UNK: Agent Gray : we've never heard of your boy.
Castle : So cool.
Castle : I can't believe Fletcher conned me.
Beckett : We need to take another run at Elise,
Beckett : see if there's anything else she's holding out on us.
UNK: Dad! We need to talk.
Castle : - Sweetie. - Sit!
Alexis : Dylan called.
UNK: Did you call Juilliard and check on him?
Esposito : - Maybe. - I can't believe you.
Alexis : After I told you how much taking lessons from him means to me.
Castle : - Sweetie. - No, no, quiet!
Alexis : Am I a trouble-maker, Dad?
Alexis : Do I get drunk, disobey authority, steal police horses naked?
Alexis : No. That'd be you.
Alexis : I seem to be the only person in this family blessed with good judgment,
Alexis : and, yet, you don't trust me.
UNK: I trust you. It's just, it's a dangerous world out there and people lie.
Alexis : You don't think I know that? I'm in high school.
Alexis : It's like the wild, wild West with hormones.
