UNK: I mean, it's the great thing about New York.
Alexis : Yeah, and if there wasn't a connection, you could always pretend there is one.
UNK: Besides the rehearsal, we have another drama going on here this evening.
UNK: Oh. Owen?
Alexis : You know how Thalia said she had a crush on Owen at Camp Chumash?
Castle : Serendipity at Serendipity. Yeah.
Alexis : No. More like subterfuge at Serendipity.
Alexis : She never even went to Camp Chumash, but her friend did,
Alexis : and Thalia wanted to meet Owen, so she staged the whole thing.
UNK: That is so budding-sociopath.
