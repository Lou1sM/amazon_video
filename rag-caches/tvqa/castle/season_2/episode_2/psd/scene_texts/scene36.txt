Cosway : Do you guys have any suspects at all yet, or...
Castle : We're looking at someone right now.
Cosway : Okay, well, actually, I have to meet the movers at Ashley's office,
Cosway : - so if you don't mind walking with me... - Not at all.
Beckett : Could you tell us what you did right after the basketball game?
UNK: After? Why do you ask?
Beckett : We're just trying to get our timeline straight.
Cosway : Not accusing me of killing my wife again, are you?
Beckett : I can assure you that we are 100% certain you did not kill Ashley.
Beckett : It's just, the night of the murder,
Beckett : you said that you were on your way to pick her up right after the game.
Cosway : Yeah, so?
Beckett : Well, then why did it take you two hours
Beckett : to get from the Garden to 18th Street?
Cosway : Look, I knew Ash wanted to work late, all right.
Cosway : I didn't want to bother her, so I just killed some time.
UNK: Ooh.
Castle : Sorry. Go ahead.
Cosway : - And then I stopped at a newsstand. - Where?
UNK: Somewhere on Seventh. Maybe it was 26th.
Cosway : I don't know. Anyway, I bought myself a slice of pizza. At Ray's.
Castle : Original Famous or Famous Original?
Castle : There's one on 28th and there's one on 23rd. I can't remember which.
Cosway : I'm a little confused here, you know.
Cosway : There is somebody out there that killed my wife.
Beckett : Mr. Cosway, we're just trying to figure this out.
Cosway : Um, I, uh... After that, I went home.
Beckett : Is there anyone that can vouch for that?
Cosway : Yeah, I'm sure somebody in my building.
Beckett : - Thank you so much for your time. - Of course.
Beckett : - Looks like we found our body of water. - Strangers on a boat?
