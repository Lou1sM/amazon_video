UNK: watching the game till it finished at 10 : 00.
UNK: And then he made the call from Ashley's office at 11 : 47.
Castle : Garden is on 32nd. Her office is on 18th.
UNK: It would've taken him max 20 minutes.
UNK: So why did it take him two hours?
UNK: Because, Esposito, he jumped in a cab, went uptown, killed Frank.
UNK: Which happened at 11 : 00.
UNK: He easily makes it back to his wife's office in time to find her body at 11 : 47.
UNK: And we know that Eric clocked out of work at 6 : 03.
UNK: And Ashley's killed at 8 : 00.
UNK: He shows up for the party at the bar at 9 : 15.
UNK: Something tells me their alibis are not going to be so airtight
UNK: for the other murders.
Beckett : Mr. Cosway. We were just coming to see you.
Cosway : Oh, hey. You guys have news? I mean, is it the old patient of Ashley's?
Cosway : - That turn out to be anything, or... - No, but we are making progress.
Cosway : Okay. What can I do for you?
Beckett : Just like to ask you a few questions about the night of the murder.
