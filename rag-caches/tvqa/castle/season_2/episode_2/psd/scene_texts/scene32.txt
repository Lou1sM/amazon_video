Beckett : I guess you could say, "What does it matter?
UNK: "The person that you love is dead." But knowing why matters.
Esposito : - Yo, fish tank's a bust. - What?
Beckett : Lanie called. Water sample is not a match.
Esposito : You believe that? We're nowhere.
Beckett : What is it with these two cases?
Ryan : Yeah, Grovner was almost too good to be true.
Castle : - Not almost. - Yeah, and you guys and the husband.
Beckett : I was sure it was him. And your son-in-law.
UNK: I know. Same deal. Felt it.
UNK: Okay, it's not the fish tank, but they are connected.
UNK: We just have to figure out how.
Beckett : It's just we've been over these cases so many times,
Beckett : it's hard to see straight anymore.
Beckett : All right. We'll start over. Fresh eyes. You take our murder, we'll take yours.
