UNK: Put up your hands so we see them!
Beckett : Wesley Grovner, I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
UNK: What? I miss another parole meeting?
UNK: He's clean. So to speak.
Beckett : Where were you last Tuesday night?
UNK: Am I being Punk'd?
UNK: If by "Punk'd" you mean "arrested for murder," yeah.
Grovner : You think I went somewhere Tuesday night and killed somebody?
Castle : Actually, two somebodies.
UNK: Hey! I'm Houdini. Nice bling, huh?
UNK: Oops.
Grovner : Check this out.
Grovner : This stoop is the edge of my Earth since I busted parole a week ago.
Grovner : Whatever you think I did, I ain't your guy.
Castle : That's quite the coincidence.
Martha : How dare you! How dare you take my dress!
Martha : - You're as thoughtless as your father! I'm sorry, I just...
Alexis : Stop! No! I didn't... I didn't take anything!
Cosway : - I didn't! - I ought to break your little wrists!
Castle : Mother, have you finally...
Martha : - Have I finally what, dear? - Hey, Dad.
Castle : - You're rehearsing. Yes, I have a call back.
Martha : Oh, and you believed us? Oh, my God. That's marvelous.
Castle : You know, I am a better actress than I think I am.
Alexis : You okay, Dad? You look upset.
Castle : Turns out something I was so sure of was just a coincidence.
Martha : - Is this about the murder? - Exactly.
Castle : It so happens that our two victims were connected.
Castle : It just had nothing to do with their deaths.
Martha : You know, I bet if you looked hard enough
Martha : you'd find a connection between everybody in this city.
