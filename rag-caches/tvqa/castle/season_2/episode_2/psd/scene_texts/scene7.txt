UNK: because things have been a little rocky with us lately.
Castle : Nothing smoothes rocky like Rocky Road.
Castle : Just remember, it's a school night. Be home by midnight.
UNK: - Dad, I'll be home by 9 : 00. Love you. - Love you.
Martha : - Yeah, bye, darling. - Bye, guys.
Martha : Young love. First, banana splits. Then splitting assets.
Castle : - Mother, you are a hopeless romantic. - I know.
Martha : - Oops, I'm off to an audition. - And I have a bet to win.
UNK: Brandy Rossi : Yes, Detective, that's my credit card. I had dinner with her last night.
UNK: Brandy Rossi : She's my best friend. When I left her there, she was alive.
Beckett : - What time did you leave, Ms. Rossi? - Around 7 : 00.
Castle : Then where did you go?
UNK: To drinks with other associates from my firm.
UNK: I was at the Gansevoort bar until 11 : 00.
Beckett : Did you make plans to have dinner together or did you just show up?
Rossi : She called me. She said she wanted to talk.
