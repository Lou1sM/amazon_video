Beckett : - Why'd you do that? - Do what?
Castle : All right, I'm just gonna say it, I've got a feeling.
Castle : Doesn't happen often, but I am feeling it, this is our guy.
Beckett : Mr. Ross?
UNK: Hal Ross : What's up? Garbage on my sidewalk again?
Beckett : Would you mind putting that down?
UNK: Where were you last night between the hours of... When was that again?
UNK: What are you talking about?
Beckett : - Are you familiar with Ashley Cosway? - Well, yeah, sure. The doc.
Castle : - Well, she was murdered last night. - What? The doc's dead?
UNK: Can you confirm your whereabouts between 7 : 30 and 9 : 00 last night?
UNK: Yeah, sure. I was here. I'm open till 10 : 00 every night.
Beckett : - Can anyone corroborate that? - My employees.
UNK: Well, how convenient that your alibis are on your payroll.
Ross : What would make you think that I killed the doc?
Beckett : Mr. Ross, you have a history of violence. Assault. Battery.
Castle : Okay, well, why do you think I was in therapy?
Ross : Okay, Doc Cosway showed me that I was only hurting myself.
UNK: Come on, Hal, we know something bad happened last Friday. Come on.
UNK: Something happened all right, but it wasn't in my session.
UNK: You want to talk to somebody, you try the appointment before mine.
