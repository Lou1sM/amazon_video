Beckett : Why is that?
Ross : Judy and I, we were in the little waiting room before our session,
Ross : - we hear all this yelling. - About what?
Ross : I don't know. But this guy was cursing Doc Cosway out big-time.
Ross : And it was kind of scary. I was tempted to go in there,
Ross : but then we heard the guy leave.
Beckett : Did you get a good look at his face?
Ross : No, no, no, he went out the hallway door.
Ross : Doc got us, she was rattled, but she did our session anyway.
Castle : I got a feeling this isn't our guy.
Beckett : Hinkle. Evan Hinkle.
Beckett : He's had the appointment before the Rosses
Beckett : every week for the last two years.
UNK: Yeah, the guy's clean. There's no record of anything.
