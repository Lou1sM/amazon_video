Castle : Whoever she had dinner with
Castle : may have been the last person to see her alive.
Beckett : Or the first one to see her dead. Run the card.
Castle : You know, if this was one of those super science-y forensic shows,
UNK: we'd stick some electrodes in these fishes' brains.
UNK: Get a fish-eye view of whatever they saw.
UNK: Dr. Parish. When'd they change the dress code downtown?
Lanie : Well, unlike you, I don't sit around work all night
Lanie : waiting for the next vic to show.
Lanie : - Quit looking at the girls, Castle. - Roger that.
Lanie : Multiple GSWs. Entries look fairly small-caliber, probably a.22.
UNK: "Psycho The Rapist"? "You're out of time"?
Lanie : Looks like a patient lost their patience.

Beckett : What was she doing here so late?
Cosway : She always would have a couple nights a month
