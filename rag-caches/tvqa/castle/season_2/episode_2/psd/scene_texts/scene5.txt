UNK: Actually, pop-and-drops are some of the hardest cases to close.
Ryan : Randomness of the victim, anonymous nature of the crime.
UNK: It takes some real serious detective work.
Castle : Okay. Well, if you guys want any help, you know where to find me.
UNK: "Help"? Did you just say "help"?
Esposito : Don't worry about us, Castle.
Esposito : We'll probably close ours before your therapist.
Beckett : - Really? - Mmm-hmm.
Castle : Well, perhaps you'd like to make things interesting.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Wait. Are you saying you want to wager on who solves their case first?
Esposito : That's sick, bro. Fifty bucks?
Ryan : - We win, you pay us both. - Deal.
Ryan : - Sit down, sit down, sit down. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Esposito : Not a word to Beckett, okay?
UNK: If she finds out about this, she'll shoot us.
