UNK: You wanna bet? Or maybe double down?
Esposito : No, no, no, no, no, no. Not money. Humiliation.
Esposito : Loser wears a dress to the precinct for a week.
Ryan : Why stop there? Loser also shaves his head.
Ryan : Or are you chicken?
Castle : You're on, honey-milk.
UNK: - "Honey-milk." - Damn it.
UNK: For the record, Mr. Hinkle,
UNK: you're admitting that you were Dr. Cosway's 1 : 00 appointment?
UNK: Evan Hinkle : I knew this would happen. I knew it.
UNK: Evan Hinkle : First time I met her, I knew she'd leave me.
UNK: Evan Hinkle : Why does this always happen? Why do people keep leaving me?
Beckett : She didn't leave you, Mr. Hinkle. She was murdered.
Hinkle : Yeah. Just like my first wife.
Castle : - Your first wife was murdered? - That's right.
Hinkle : I smothered her to death. Yeah. That's what she told me.
Hinkle : I murdered her with love. That's why she left.
Beckett : Just tell us about your last appointment with Dr. Cosway.
Hinkle : We were just starting to make progress. You know the irony here?
Hinkle : Her death is my moment of greatest crisis and I don't have her to lean on.
Beckett : What was all the screaming about at the appointment last Friday?
UNK: Screaming? Last Friday? I did not see her last Friday.
Castle : You're in the books. "You're" with an apostrophe.
UNK: Yeah, well, I canceled an hour before.
UNK: - You canceled? - Yes. Yes, I was having chest pains.
Hinkle : I went to the ER at St. Vincent's.
UNK: $ 15,000 later, turns out I was just having a panic attack,
Hinkle : about Mother, you know.
Beckett : - I think we're done here. Thank you. - Thank you.
Hinkle : You know, at least Dr. Cosway didn't charge me for canceling last minute.
Beckett : Why not?
UNK: She said she was going out to lunch with her husband,
UNK: so it was time well-spent.
UNK: - Thank you, Mr. Hinkle. - Thank you.
Castle : And by the way, it's a common mistake,
UNK: but it's not ironic that Dr. Cosway's not here for you to lean on.
Castle : It's just simply tragic.
