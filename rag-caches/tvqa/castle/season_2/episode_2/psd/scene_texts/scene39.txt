UNK: - Ryan, you were on fire tonight. - New nickname, Ice-posito.
Castle : Excellent work, Detective.
Beckett : Yeah, well, once we realized that Jason was the alpha and wouldn't break,
Beckett : it was obvious that Eric was the weak link.
UNK: Nice. When you guys came in the room and we knew you were playing,
UNK: everything just kind of went...
Ryan : Yeah, that's right, of course, we were right with you guys.
Beckett : - Oh, please. - That was the whole point,
Castle : was that you weren't in on it. That's how we sold it.
Esposito : Well, that's neither here nor there, because we won the bet.
Castle : - How's that? - Our guy broke.
Beckett : Yeah. Because we broke him.
Ryan : So what? It's like soccer. You score in our goal, it's still our point.
Beckett : Soccer? Really? You're going with that one?
Esposito : - Works for me. - Well, then, how about baseball?
UNK: Because this team just knocked it out of the park.
Ryan : Yeah, but our team was supposed to be at the bat.
UNK: - Again with that one. - Your team didn't make it to the field
UNK: because they were too scared to get off the bus.
