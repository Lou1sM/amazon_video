Ross : And it was kind of scary. I was tempted to go in there,
Ross : but then we heard the guy leave.
Beckett : Did you get a good look at his face?
Ross : No, no, no, he went out the hallway door.
Ross : Doc got us, she was rattled, but she did our session anyway.
Castle : I got a feeling this isn't our guy.
Beckett : Hinkle. Evan Hinkle.
Beckett : He's had the appointment before the Rosses
Beckett : every week for the last two years.
UNK: Yeah, the guy's clean. There's no record of anything.
Castle : Two straight years of therapy, maybe he just snapped.
Beckett : Have uniforms bring him in. I'm gonna go get a coffee.
Karpowski : Esposito tipped me off to the bet. Thought I'd toss a little towards ours.
Castle : Toss away, my friend.
Castle : And spread the word around, if anyone else wants a taste.
UNK: Let's go. Come on, big fellow.
Ryan : Left over here.
Esposito : Take a seat.
Castle : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Castle : I thought you said you guys were looking
Castle : for a gang member, like a teenager.
Ryan : - You were right. They alibied out. - So who's in cuffs?
Ryan : Just a mugger who happened to be working in the same area
Ryan : the same night our vic was killed.
Esposito : Yeah, he was picked up with a.45 on him,
Esposito : which happens to be the same round that was found in our vic.
Esposito : Just waiting on ballistics. Unless he confesses first.
Castle : - So where's his lawyer? - Ooh! Whoa, whoa.
Ryan : - He hasn't asked for one. - Well, I know a guy.
Esposito : What's the matter, Castle? Are you getting worried?
UNK: Worried? Worried? I'll make you cry.
UNK: You wanna bet? Or maybe double down?
Esposito : No, no, no, no, no, no. Not money. Humiliation.
Esposito : Loser wears a dress to the precinct for a week.
Ryan : Why stop there? Loser also shaves his head.
Ryan : Or are you chicken?
Castle : You're on, honey-milk.
UNK: - "Honey-milk." - Damn it.
UNK: For the record, Mr. Hinkle,
UNK: you're admitting that you were Dr. Cosway's 1 : 00 appointment?
UNK: Evan Hinkle : I knew this would happen. I knew it.
UNK: Evan Hinkle : First time I met her, I knew she'd leave me.
UNK: Evan Hinkle : Why does this always happen? Why do people keep leaving me?
Beckett : She didn't leave you, Mr. Hinkle. She was murdered.
Hinkle : Yeah. Just like my first wife.
Castle : - Your first wife was murdered? - That's right.
Hinkle : I smothered her to death. Yeah. That's what she told me.
Hinkle : I murdered her with love. That's why she left.
Beckett : Just tell us about your last appointment with Dr. Cosway.
Hinkle : We were just starting to make progress. You know the irony here?
Hinkle : Her death is my moment of greatest crisis and I don't have her to lean on.
Beckett : What was all the screaming about at the appointment last Friday?
UNK: Screaming? Last Friday? I did not see her last Friday.
Castle : You're in the books. "You're" with an apostrophe.
UNK: Yeah, well, I canceled an hour before.
UNK: - You canceled? - Yes. Yes, I was having chest pains.
Hinkle : I went to the ER at St. Vincent's.
UNK: $ 15,000 later, turns out I was just having a panic attack,
Hinkle : about Mother, you know.
Beckett : - I think we're done here. Thank you. - Thank you.
Hinkle : You know, at least Dr. Cosway didn't charge me for canceling last minute.
Beckett : Why not?
UNK: She said she was going out to lunch with her husband,
UNK: so it was time well-spent.
UNK: - Thank you, Mr. Hinkle. - Thank you.
Castle : And by the way, it's a common mistake,
UNK: but it's not ironic that Dr. Cosway's not here for you to lean on.
Castle : It's just simply tragic.
Castle : It would be ironic if her death made you feel better.
Lanie : - Castle. - Just... You can...
UNK: What's with the super-cop?
Castle : I have no idea what you're talking about.
Beckett : - Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. - I'm in for $50, you know that.
