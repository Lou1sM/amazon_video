UNK: Jason Fenn : Mr. Castle, we take the safety of our guests very seriously.
UNK: Jason Fenn : Our weapons look real, but they're legal, inoperable,
UNK: Jason Fenn : and rigged for game play.
UNK: Jason Fenn : So if one of the guests killed Roger, they used their own weapon, not ours.
Castle : So the weapons are fake, but the money is real?
UNK: Liz Fenn : - What money? - The 5,000 Euros we found in the car.
UNK: Jason Fenn : Uh, yeah, we do money drops sometimes,
UNK: Jason Fenn : but never with real currency.
UNK: Liz Fenn : That's more than he paid for his package.
UNK: Liz Fenn : - Are you sure it was real? - Positive.
Beckett : What was Mr. Farraday doing in the park that night?
Beckett : - Was that a part of a mission? - No, no, no.
