Demming : What is it you're looking for, Kate?
Castle : It was very emotional. Yeah, there were a lot of tears.
Castle : Um... Alexis was fine, by the way.
Esposito : I gotta say, Castle, we're gonna miss you around here.
Castle : Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.
Ryan : You're still leaving the coffee machine, though, right?
Castle : - I can't have you suffer in my absence. - That's good.
Lanie : We could really use one of those down in the morgue.
Montgomery : With Castle gone, I just hope our clearance rate doesn't drop.
Castle : Oh! Look who's off duty.
Beckett : Yeah, well, Castle, I'm not all work.
Lanie : Don't get into a drinking contest with her.
Lanie : - She can take you. - Thank you.
Beckett : Oh, I don't need to drink to take him.
Lanie : Ooh! What's gotten into you?
Beckett : - Castle, do you have a second? - Of course. Yeah.
Castle : What's up?
Beckett : Look... I know that I'm not the easiest person to get to know,
Beckett : and I don't always let on what's on my mind.
