Castle : - On Memorial Day? - Yes.
Beckett : I spent all of my vacation days looking for a new place to live.
Castle : - Aren't you Steve's friend? - No, Steve's my brother.
Hans : Brauer. Hans Brauer.
Lanie : Shawn Caldwell.
Hans : We don't have much time.
Hans : The target's in country, but on the move.
Hans : Go to Alpha location and look for the sign,
Hans : but Blackbird wants you to know, there are other assets in play.
Hans : So, if they move on you, go to ground.
Hans : But if you get a shot, take it. Understood?
UNK: Understood.
UNK: Uh... Wait.
Castle : My people need confirmation on the target's name.
Hans : - What did you say? - The target's name,
Castle : my people need confirmation.
UNK: Ah!
Martha : - Who are you? NYPD!
Beckett : Hands up.
Beckett : - Not you, Castle. - Right.
Hans : You people have no idea what you just stepped into.
Hans : No idea.
Beckett : Why don't you tell us?
Hans : Because you don't want to know. The things that I've seen?
Hans : Trust me, ignorance is bliss.
Castle : Who do you work for? The government?
Beckett : Well, if not the government, then who?
Hans : - What happened to the real Caldwell? - Dead.
Beckett : - When? - Last night.
Hans : That means they know.
Beckett : They know about what?
Beckett : About the target?
Beckett : About how you were going to "take your shot"?
Castle : Who's your target, Hans?
Hans : I spent three weeks in Afghanistan with fire ants crawling on my privates.
