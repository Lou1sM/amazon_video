UNK: I must have done something wrong. Must have messed up the passports...
UNK: And they came after him and they killed him.
UNK: Andrea Fisher : The briefcase, where did he deliver it to?
Beckett : Hugo, the Ukrainians, I need an address now.
Beckett : - NYPD! Hands up! - Freeze!
Beckett : - Clear! - Clear!
Esposito : Turn 'em around!
UNK: Officer 1 : Get up there, now! Stay there! Stay there!
UNK: Kids.
Esposito : Yep, they're Ukrainians, but they're students.
Esposito : They're used to being able to drink back home,
Esposito : but they needed fake IDs to buy booze here.
Esposito : They got Hugo's information from another kid in the summer program.
Alexis : Summer program?
Esposito : Yeah, they're part of the summer exchange program
Esposito : at Hudson University.
Martha : - Why? - No reason.
Esposito : Anyway, none of them own a dark sedan.
Esposito : And seeing as how they all went out partying
Esposito : the moment Roger dropped off the IDs, it's doubtful any of them are our killer.
UNK: Mmm.
Castle : You actually think he was being followed?
UNK: He calls at 11 : 30, and then just before he's shot,
UNK: his car is damaged.
UNK: He runs on foot into the park.
UNK: Sounds to me like he was running away.
UNK: But from whom?
Castle : As much as I'd like to help you run down every dark sedan in the city,
Castle : I have a poker game to host.
Castle : See you in the morning.
Demming : See you.
UNK: So...
Esposito : - Castle's last case, huh? - Mmm-hmm.
