UNK: Wow.
UNK: Melinda Farraday : What? You want me to say I'm sorry?
UNK: Melinda Farraday : You want me to be embarrassed? I'm not.
UNK: Melinda Farraday : Do you know how long it had been since Roger and I made love?
UNK: Melinda Farraday : All he cared about was work and his extreme vacations.
UNK: Melinda Farraday : So, yeah, I was seeing Lee.
UNK: Melinda Farraday : Yeah, I was with him that night.
Beckett : Well, if things were that bad, why not just get a divorce?
UNK: Melinda Farraday : Are you serious? My house is too nice.
Castle : I can see why Roger needed a little extra fantasy in his life.
Esposito : I talked to the wife's neighbors.
Esposito : A few of them remember Lee's car outside the house that night.
Ryan : That doesn't mean anything. The guy runs an auto dealership.
UNK: He could have just switched cars.
UNK: True, except it was a warm night.
Esposito : Warm enough to leave the windows open.
Esposito : - Oh, no. - Oh, yes.
UNK: The next-door neighbor distinctly remembers
Esposito : hearing the sounds of loud, passionate lovemaking
Esposito : coming from the open bedroom window.
Esposito : - Kept him up till well past midnight. - I don't buy it.
Castle : They both had motive. They were having an affair.
Castle : They knew exactly where he was.
Castle : Just because they had an alibi does not mean they didn't do it.
Beckett : Do you think they hired someone?
Castle : It had all the hallmarks of a professional hit.
Beckett : It couldn't have been Lee unless he asked the bankruptcy court
Beckett : for permission to hire a hit man, and I don't think that's likely.
Ryan : And the only unusual charge in the Farradays' account
UNK: was the 10 grand that Roger wired to the Spy Ventures account
