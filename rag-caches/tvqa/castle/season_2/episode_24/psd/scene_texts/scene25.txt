UNK: Hugo Morrison : - but they were paying so much money. - Who?
UNK: Hugo Morrison : They're Ukrainians. They found me on the Internet.
UNK: Hugo Morrison : They said they needed passports.
UNK: Hugo Morrison : I sent Roger to make the drop and pick up the money.
Castle : 5,000 Euros.
UNK: Hugo Morrison : He thought it was just another mission.
UNK: Hugo Morrison : But something must have gone wrong.
UNK: Hugo Morrison : After he made the drop, he called me on the hotline,
UNK: Hugo Morrison : said he was being followed by a dark sedan.
Beckett : A dark sedan? And what time was this?
UNK: 11 : 30-ish. Look, playing the game, it makes you paranoid.
UNK: So I figured it was just his imagination.
UNK: So I gave him the standard line about evasive maneuvers.
UNK: I didn't really think he was being followed.
UNK: But he was.
UNK: He called again close to midnight and said his cover had been blown.
UNK: I thought he was messing with me, so I shined him on.
UNK: I shined him on, and now he's dead.
