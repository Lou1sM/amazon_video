Ryan : who were camped a couple hundred yards from the overpass last night.
Ryan : They didn't see or hear anything.
UNK: Couple of hundred yards? How do you not hear five gunshots?
Castle : - Unless... - He used a silencer.
Castle : To kill a man who went out of the way to hide who he was?
Esposito : This is starting to sound more and more like a professional hit.
UNK: Yeah, we're nowhere till we figure out who this guy actually is.
Beckett : So why don't you guys go canvass the area near the entrance to the park,
Beckett : see if you can find his car.
Beckett : And fax his photo to the local hotels, see if anyone recognizes his face.
Castle : Right on.
Castle : You know, I was... I was kidding about the assassin stuff.
Beckett : That's Lanie.
Beckett : Please tell me that you found something.
Lanie : Well, I found nothing that sheds light on the identity of your victim,
Lanie : but I did find something that may help with your killer.
Lanie : We know the shooter tried to scrub the crime scene
Lanie : of ballistic evidence, but one of the rounds
Lanie : shattered Mr. Caldwell's rib and left this little souvenir.
Beckett : A bullet fragment? - Can't tell the caliber,
Lanie : but this polygonal rifling along the outer rim
Lanie : is consistent with the barrel of a Glock.
UNK: Hmm.
Castle : - What? - The grouping of the shots.
Castle : You see how tight they all are?
Beckett : There's no stippling, no muzzle burns.
Beckett : The killer must have shot from a distance.
Castle : Which means he's a very good shot.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Great. Thanks.
UNK: They found the car.
Esposito : Car is registered to Allied Fleet Services,
Esposito : a car rental agency.
Castle : Well, I hope they got the insurance option.
Beckett : Who did they rent it to?
Esposito : This particular car is on a long-term lease to FGS.
