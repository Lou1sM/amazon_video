Castle : Is there anything you're not bringing?
Alexis : You. Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Alexis : This is the first time you've ever been alone this long.
Castle : I'm supposed to be saying that to you.
Castle : And besides, I might not be alone for very long.
Alexis : You invited someone?
Castle : She said no at first, but I got a feeling she'll come around.
Alexis : Oh. Is it anyone I know?
Castle : I don't kiss and tell.
UNK: Well, looks like I'm not the only one who's getting lucky this summer.
