UNK: Andrea Fisher : And we could have one last time together.
UNK: Ken Fisher : Hey, hon, I'm back.
Castle : Oh, my God. Please don't tell my husband.
Beckett : We don't have to, Mrs. Fisher.
Beckett : He already knows.
UNK: Stephen J. Cannell : What's going on?
Beckett : Mr. Fisher, I'm Detective Kate Beckett. NYPD.
UNK: Ken Fisher : What's this about?
Beckett : You own a black 2009 four-door sedan?
Ryan : Yeah, why?
Beckett : - Where is it? - It's in the shop.
UNK: Ken Fisher : I hit a pole while I was backing out at the supermarket.
Castle : You're a much better shot than you are a liar.
Beckett : The state of New York lists you as a registered gun owner,
Beckett : Glock 45.
Castle : Oh, my God.
UNK: Andrea Fisher : Oh, my God. What did you do to him?
UNK: Ken Fisher : What he deserved.
Montgomery : So Roger was right about being followed that night.
Beckett : When the husband got on to the affair, he did a little spy game of his own.
Beckett : Tracked down and killed his wife's lover.
Montgomery : Mmm. Two affairs, a loveless marriage.
Montgomery : It's sad a man had to die because all the people involved
Montgomery : were too scared to say what they really felt.
Beckett : Yes, it is sad.
UNK: And how many shows like that? Sure. Make it two, and you got a deal.
UNK: All right.
UNK: Hey, I gotta run. I gotta drive Alexis to Princeton.
UNK: But I will be back in time for that little surprise party
UNK: the boys are throwing for me... What? What?
UNK: Nothing.
Castle : - Okay. I'll see you. - Mmm-hmm.
Demming : It's like a real restaurant-style cappuccino machine.
