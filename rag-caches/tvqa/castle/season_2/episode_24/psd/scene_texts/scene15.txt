UNK: All right, find out who the hell's in charge.
Beckett : Let's see if "authenticity" includes murder.
Martha : Are you still hiding from Gina?
Castle : She's persistent, I'll give her that.
Martha : You can't outrun her forever, darling.
Martha : - Why don't I just talk to her? - No! No!
Castle : No, no, no.
UNK: - All right. - Ah!
Castle : Does the reemergence of summer hats
Castle : mean you'll be making an appearance in the Hamptons?
Martha : Alas, you're going to have to stagger along without me.
Martha : - I got the part! - Fantastic!
Castle : - I'm so proud! - Thank you, thank you.
Martha : It's not the biggest role in the world, but I do love summer stock.
Martha : - You gonna be okay? - Why wouldn't I be?
Martha : I'm gonna be gone through August. Alexis is away, and...
Castle : I'll be fine. I'll finish the book.
Martha : - Good. - What about Chet? He'll be all alone.
Martha : It's good for him to miss me.
Martha : I don't want him to assume that I'm gonna always just be around.
Carter : Sweet place.
Alexis : Oh! Everyone's here.
Castle : - You were expecting to be alone? - No, you're just home early.
Alexis : This is Carter. He's going to the Princeton program, too.
Castle : Is he now?
Martha : - Lovely to meet you, Carter. - Nice to meet you.
Alexis : - Um, I'll meet you in the kitchen. - Oh.
UNK: Yeah.
Alexis : I friended him on the program page and found out he lived nearby,
Alexis : so we decided to hook up.
Alexis : We just thought it'd be nice to go there knowing someone,
Alexis : and our rooms are right across from each other.
