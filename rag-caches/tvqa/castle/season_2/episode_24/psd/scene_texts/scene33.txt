Esposito : in the Cayman Islands.
Ryan : - Ten grand? - Yeah, why?
Castle : Because he only should've paid half that much.
Castle : Do you remember what the woman at Spy Ventures
Castle : said about the money we found in the car?
Beckett : Yeah, that 5,000 Euros was more than what he paid for his entire spy-cation.
Ryan : His bank statement indicates he transferred two payments
Ryan : of five grand each to the game, for a total of $ 10,000.
Castle : The payments were made at the same time,
Castle : almost like he paid twice.
UNK: Jason Fenn : If these numbers are correct, he did pay twice.
UNK: Jason Fenn : Once for him, once for another player.
UNK: Jason Fenn : Another player? - Who was the other player?
UNK: Liz Fenn : - Andrea Fisher. Our Long Island housewife?
Castle : She said she never met Roger until they were teamed up for the game.
Beckett : But if they never met, why did he pay for her?
UNK: Andrea Fisher : There must be some mistake.
Beckett : We checked with the bank, Mrs. Fisher.
Beckett : There is no mistake.
Beckett : - You never paid Spy Ventures. - But Roger did.
Castle : The coupon clipping was a nice touch, though.
