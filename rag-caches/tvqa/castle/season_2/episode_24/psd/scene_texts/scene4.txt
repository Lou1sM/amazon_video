Castle : We've done it since she was five.
Beckett : Sounds nice. Kind of magical, actually.
Castle : Yeah, you know what? You should come.
Castle : Oh, it's right on the ocean. There's a secluded pool.
Castle : You could lay out, work on your tan.
Beckett : Wow, Castle, you're working really hard to see me in a swimsuit.
Castle : If you are not comfortable in a swimsuit, you can just skinny dip.
Esposito : Vic's a white male. Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.
Esposito : Found him about an hour ago.
UNK: Mugging?
Esposito : Nah, still has his watch, wallet and cash.
Ryan : Then there's the matter of the phantom bullets.
Esposito : Yeah, he took five to the chest.
Esposito : There are no slugs, shell casings. And the killer went so far
Esposito : as to dig his bullets out of that tree branch.
Beckett : That's weird. What about in the body?
Lanie : They're all through and throughs. Exit holes on each wound.
Beckett : So, our doer cleaned up after himself.
Castle : It takes real presence of mind to put five bullets into a man's chest
