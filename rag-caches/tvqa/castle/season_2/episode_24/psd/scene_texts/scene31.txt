UNK: Lee Copley : Roger was my friend. We grew up together.
UNK: Lee Copley : Why would I kill him?
Castle : I can give you half a million reasons why.
UNK: Lee Copley : What, because I'm having financial problems?
UNK: Lee Copley : Because we just happen to own a business together?
Castle : Greed, Mr. Copley, it's the purest motive there is.
UNK: Lee Copley : This is ridiculous.
Beckett : Where were you the night that Roger Farraday was murdered?
UNK: Lee Copley : I was home in bed.
UNK: Really? Then do you care to explain these?
Beckett : These are photos of you leaving your apartment garage
UNK: at 8 : 00 the night that he was murdered.
Beckett : And these are photos of you returning the following morning at 7 : 00 a.m.
Castle : Kind of blows a hole in your whole "home in bed" thing.
UNK: You lied to me, Mr. Copley. Do you care to revise your statement?
UNK: 8 : 00 p.m. That's plenty of time to drive to the city from Stamford.
Castle : What'd you do, Lee?
Castle : Wait for him at the hotel, follow him till he was alone?
UNK: Lee Copley : - No, I didn't. - And then you used the game as cover.
UNK: Lee Copley : No. Look, I swear, I didn't do it.
Beckett : Right. You were at home in bed.
UNK: Lee Copley : No, I wasn't at home, but I was in bed
UNK: Lee Copley : with his wife.
Beckett : I'm sorry. What?
UNK: Lee Copley : I was in bed with Roger's wife.
Castle : Let me get this straight.
Castle : Your alibi for killing your friend is you were doing his wife?
UNK: Yeah.
