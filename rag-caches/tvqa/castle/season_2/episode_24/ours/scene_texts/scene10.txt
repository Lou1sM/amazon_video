Castle : - Okay. I'll see you. - Mmm-hmm.
Demming : It's like a real restaurant-style cappuccino machine.
Castle : Is there anything you're not bringing?
Alexis : You. Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Alexis : This is the first time you've ever been alone this long.
Castle : I'm supposed to be saying that to you.
Castle : And besides, I might not be alone for very long.
Alexis : You invited someone?
Castle : She said no at first, but I got a feeling she'll come around.
Alexis : Oh. Is it anyone I know?
Castle : I don't kiss and tell.
UNK: Well, looks like I'm not the only one who's getting lucky this summer.
UNK: - Kidding, kidding. I'm just kidding. - That's not funny.
Castle : That's so not funny.
Demming : It's not just this weekend we're talking about, is it?
UNK: Walter Burns cary Grant : - No. - No.
Demming : Was it something I said, Kate?
UNK: - Or something I did? - No, you're great.
Beckett : You're really great, and I really like you.
Beckett : It's just, I don't think that this is what I'm looking for right now.
Demming : What is it you're looking for, Kate?
Castle : It was very emotional. Yeah, there were a lot of tears.
Castle : Um... Alexis was fine, by the way.
Esposito : I gotta say, Castle, we're gonna miss you around here.
Castle : Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.
Ryan : You're still leaving the coffee machine, though, right?
Castle : - I can't have you suffer in my absence. - That's good.
Lanie : We could really use one of those down in the morgue.
Montgomery : With Castle gone, I just hope our clearance rate doesn't drop.
Castle : Oh! Look who's off duty.
Beckett : Yeah, well, Castle, I'm not all work.
Lanie : Don't get into a drinking contest with her.
Lanie : - She can take you. - Thank you.
Beckett : Oh, I don't need to drink to take him.
Lanie : Ooh! What's gotten into you?
Beckett : - Castle, do you have a second? - Of course. Yeah.
Castle : What's up?
Beckett : Look... I know that I'm not the easiest person to get to know,
Beckett : and I don't always let on what's on my mind.
Beckett : But this past year, working with you,
Beckett : I've had a really good time.
Castle : Yeah. Me, too.
UNK: - So, I'm just gonna say this and... Richard?
Demming : - You ready? - Hey, Gina.
Castle : Beckett, you remember Gina, my ex-wife.
Gina : - And publisher. - Yes.
Beckett : Yeah, we spoke the other day. Looks like you finally tracked him down.
Beckett : Oh, yeah, he's such a little boy sometimes.
Gina : I mean, I don't know why. It's not like I bite
UNK: much.
Gina : We better get going or we're gonna be stuck in traffic all night.
Castle : - Going? - To the Hamptons.
Beckett : - For the weekend? - No, for the summer, actually.
Gina : So, I can stay on top of him while he finishes his book.
UNK: I'm sorry, I didn't think the two of you got along.
Castle : We didn't. But then last night on the phone,
Castle : - we started talking... - And we ended up talking for hours.
UNK: Yeah.
Gina : Just like old times. - Yeah.
Castle : So... I'm sorry. You were... You were telling me something.
Beckett : Yeah, I wanted to say, have a great summer.
Martha : You, too.
Castle : And like you said, it's been really, really great.
Beckett : Yeah, it has.
UNK: Oh.
Beckett : See you in the fall?
Beckett : See you in the fall.
