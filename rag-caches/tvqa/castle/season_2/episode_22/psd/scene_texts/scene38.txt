Castle : You ask me, she should've followed her heart,
Castle : left David, gone with Wolf.
Beckett : You know, I can see the virtue in staying.
Beckett : I mean, guys like Wolf, they come in, they upset the apple cart.
Beckett : Of course he makes you feel alive,
Beckett : but eventually, you know he's just gonna let you down.
Beckett : So why risk it?
Castle : Because the heart wants what the heart wants.
UNK: Speaking of... I gotta get out of here.
Beckett : - Madison? - No.
Castle : Actually, with everything going on,
Castle : she said she didn't have time to date. She didn't tell you that?
UNK: Mmm-mmm.
Castle : So, I gotta get home.
Castle : Alexis has a little head-heart problem of her own,
Castle : and I want to be there for the decision.
Demming : - Case closed? - Yes.
Beckett : Thank you so much for all of your help.
Demming : Anytime. But, you know, we never really finished our dinner.

Beckett : Can I take a rain check?
Demming : - Somewhere else you need to be? - Yeah.
Beckett : - How about tomorrow? - Yeah. You're on.
