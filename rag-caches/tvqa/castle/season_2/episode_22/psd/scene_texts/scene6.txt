David : he came to me asking if I would buy him out.
David : I tried to talk him out of it.
David : I even told him that I would loan him the money,
David : but he refused.
David : In the end, I gave in and I bought out his share.

UNK: $40,000.
David : Well, he put it all into the new restaurant.
David : I tried to tell him to hold some of it back,
David : but he was an all-or-nothing kind of guy.
