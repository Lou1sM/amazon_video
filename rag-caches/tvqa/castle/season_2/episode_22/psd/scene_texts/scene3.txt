Beckett : Now, did you know if Wolf had any enemies,
Beckett : anyone that wanted to do him harm?
Madison : He was the bad boy America loved to hate.
Madison : I was a guest judge. That's how we met.
Beckett : No, I don't really get a lot of time to watch TV.
UNK: Really?
Castle : What else did she spend hours doing?
Beckett : Castle, real crime scene.
Beckett : Not mystery writer research time, okay?
Beckett : - Later. - Did you notice anything unusual
Beckett : about Wolf lately? Anything at all.
UNK: There was one thing.
UNK: Wolf usually worked nonstop.
UNK: You couldn't tear him away from the kitchen.
UNK: But for the last couple of weeks, he'd disappear around 3 : 00
UNK: and come back just in time to prep at 5 : 00.
Beckett : - Did he say where he was going? - No.
Madison : He said it was personal.
Ryan : Hey, guys. I found something.
Ryan : Juan, the dishwasher, was the last one here last night,
Ryan : and he swears he finished every single dish.
Beckett : Two dirty bowls, two spoons and a soup pot?
Castle : Looks like Wolf had some late-night company.
Madison : It's popcorn soup. It's Domingo's specialty.
Madison : - Domingo? Our line chef.
Madison : He must have come back after everybody left.
Beckett : That means he's the last one to have seen Wolf alive.
Beckett : Do you have an address? - Of course.
Beckett : All right, track down Domingo and see why he was here so late,
Beckett : and what he saw.
Beckett : I'll also need the contact info for Wolf's next of kin.
Castle : High school friend, huh?
Castle : I bet she knows where all your bodies are buried.
Beckett : You can dig all you want, Castle. My secrets are safe with her.
