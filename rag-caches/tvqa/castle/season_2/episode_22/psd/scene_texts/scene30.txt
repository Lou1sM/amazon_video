Martha : A balloon ride is lovely, but not in February.
Castle : Her hand was shaking so much from the cold,
Castle : it was difficult getting that ring on.
Martha : It was a sign.
Castle : - Huh. - Mmm-hmm.
Castle : So, have you decided?
UNK: No.
Beckett : Again, David, I am so sorry for your loss.
UNK: Hey.
Castle : Shed any light?
Beckett : So, David said that he wouldn't have believed it
Beckett : unless I'd shown him the ring.
Castle : He had no idea who Wolf was proposing to,
Beckett : and neither did anyone else in his life.
Beckett : The guy was in love with a ghost.
Castle : Ooh, that'd be cool, if it was actually a ghost.
Ryan : Went back through the phone logs from the restaurant and Wolf's cell.
Ryan : Every call's accounted for.
Beckett : - What about the cafe uptown? - The wait staff all checked out.
