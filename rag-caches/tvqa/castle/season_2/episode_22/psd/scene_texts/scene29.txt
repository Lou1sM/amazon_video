UNK: Yeah, he was finishing off that cake.
Martha : A cake
UNK: with a heart-shaped mold on it.
UNK: He wasn't running away. He was going to propose.
Beckett : But to who? And why hasn't she come forward yet?
Castle : Maybe she's scared. Maybe she's in danger.
Beckett : Or maybe she killed him.
Martha : Who puts an engagement ring inside a cake?
Castle : - It's romantic. - It's a choking hazard.
Martha : I swear, men act as though there's some cosmic reward
Martha : for crazy proposals.
Martha : And what a woman really wants is a man down on one knee,
Martha : tears in his eyes, ring in his hand.
Castle : My proposal to Gina was very romantic.
