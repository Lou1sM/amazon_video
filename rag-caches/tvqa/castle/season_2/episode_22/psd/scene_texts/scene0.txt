UNK: Richard Castle : - What broke? - A stupid glass.
Castle : Remind me to get smarter glasses.
Castle : Somehow I feel that the glass is not quite the problem.
Alexis : I got invited to the Hamptons with Lacey's family
Alexis : and a couple of other friends.
Castle : Well, that sounds like fun.
Castle : So why do you look like someone who just got voted off the island?
Alexis : AP tests are next week, so I really need to study all weekend.
UNK: But I really wanna go to the Hamptons.
Castle : The eternal struggle between work and play.
Castle : The trick is, when you grow up, find work that feels like play.
Alexis : Speaking of work...
Alexis : What are you doing up and dressed so early?
Castle : Oh, no reason. Just thought I'd get an early start to my day.
UNK: Bye.
Beckett : All right. So, I'll see you tomorrow night?
UNK: - Yeah, good. Okay. See you. - Okay.
Castle : What's Demming doing in our break room?
Castle : Is there something wrong with the coffee downstairs?
Beckett : Well, you're the one who bought us the cappuccino machine, Castle.
Castle : Yes, but I bought it for homicide, not the entire precinct.
Castle : What's tomorrow night?
UNK: What?
Beckett : Tom was wondering if I wanted to get together tomorrow night.
Beckett : Why? Is that a problem?
Castle : Why would I have a problem with that?
UNK: Hmm.
Beckett : Excuse me.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : Okay. Be right there.
UNK: Tom.
Beckett : - Right. The murder is at Q3?
Castle : This place has only been open three months.
Castle : I can't even get a reservation here.
Castle : I've been dying to eat here.
Beckett : Well, evidently, you're not the only one.
Beckett : - Where are we? - In the kitchen.
