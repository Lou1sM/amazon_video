Beckett : And he just happened to have 5 grand on him?
Domingo : Yes, in his backpack.
Domingo : Look, I promised to pay him back.
Castle : He had that much money in a backpack?
Domingo : Yeah, he had more, a lot more.
Domingo : Look, I told him he shouldn't carry so much cash.
Domingo : He could get
UNK: killed.
Beckett : There was no backpack at the scene.
Domingo : Maybe that angry lady stole it. Maybe she's the one who killed Wolf.
Beckett : - What angry lady? - One of his girlfriends.
Domingo : - I left when she came. - When?
UNK: After midnight, like around 12 : 45.
Beckett : Do you know her name?
Domingo : No, but she came into the restaurant all the time.
Beckett : Can you describe her?
Beckett : So the kitchen staff confirms
Beckett : that Wolf did have a backpack with him yesterday,
Beckett : and the only reason that they noticed it is because he didn't usually carry one.
