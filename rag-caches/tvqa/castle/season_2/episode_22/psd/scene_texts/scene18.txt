Perlmutter : Now, once we got him under the heat lamps,
Perlmutter : some bruising began to present.
Perlmutter : First, there were significant contusions along his back and legs.

Beckett : Did this happen the night of the murder?
Perlmutter : These bruises are at least two weeks old.
Castle : Bruising on the body, $40,000 in cash,
Castle : sold his shares in the diner to his foster brother...
Beckett : All within the same two-week time span.
Perlmutter : I also found a fresh bruise from a blow he suffered just before he was frozen.
Perlmutter : I went through the crime scene photos from CSU,
Perlmutter : and the bruise pattern matches one of the objects from the kitchen.
Castle : Ah! Rotary evaporator.
Castle : It's a tool that chefs use to distill and extract flavors from...
Castle : And again, you don't care.
Perlmutter : Yeah, we didn't find any prints on the body of the appliance,
Perlmutter : but there were some partials on its shattered glass tube.
Perlmutter : The guys in the lab were able to humpty-dumpty together a usable print.
Perlmutter : Didn't match any of the restaurant employees,
Perlmutter : but when they ran it through AFIS,
Perlmutter : - they got a hit. - Jennifer Wong.
UNK: No.
Beckett : Who's Jennifer Wong?
