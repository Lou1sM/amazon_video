Beckett : - So, you ready? - No.
Tom : My lieutenant just brought down the hammer.
Tom : Fives have to be written up before shift end tonight. I'm sorry.
Beckett : No. You know, I have...
Beckett : I have some paperwork to do, as well. So, maybe another time.
Tom : Well, the thing is, I kind of had my heart set on tonight.
Tom : You like Chinese?
UNK: - It's my favorite. - Great. Wait here.
Rocco : - Madison, I'm so sorry. - Hi.
Rocco : It's a tragic loss. Wolf was a good friend.
Madison : Yeah, he really admired you.
Rocco : Thanks for coming tonight. It means a lot to me.
Madison : Rocco, this is Richard Castle.
Rocco : I ought to punch you in the face, Castle,
Rocco : for killing Derrick Storm like that.
UNK: He was my favorite character.
Madison : Based on my friend, Kate Beckett.
Madison : I should introduce you. You guys might hit it off.
Rocco : I'd like that. If she's half as interesting in person as she is on the page,
Rocco : I think I like her already.
Rocco : - You guys have fun. Enjoy your dinner. - Thanks.
Madison : Fabulous chef.
Castle : You really think he's Beckett's type?
Madison : Well, Becks never had a type.
Madison : She dated a guitarist in a grunge band, a med student and this French guy,
UNK: that I'm pretty sure he was some kind of royalty.
Madison : Who is she seeing now?
Castle : Just some guy. I don't see it going anywhere.
Beckett : This food's amazing.
Beckett : Where did you get it from?
Tom : Hung's China Sea.
Beckett : Get out. Hung's doesn't deliver.
Tom : Well, he delivers to me.
Tom : Mr. Hung had this medal,
UNK: a 15th century Chinese medal, Ming dynasty.
Tom : It was passed down through the generations, right?
Tom : Last year, it was stolen along with some cash
Tom : and some kitchen appliances, and whatnot.
Tom : The only thing that mattered to Mr. Hung was the medal.
Tom : So, I got it back for him.
Tom : And because I delivered, now so does he.
UNK: Really?
