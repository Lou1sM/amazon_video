Esposito : Victim's name is Balthazar Wolf. He's the head chef here.
Esposito : I know, right? - Oh, man.
Castle : I never got to taste his foie gras sandwich.
Esposito : He was found this morning by the pastry chef, Spike Ridenhauer,
Esposito : and one of the dishwashers, Juan Costa.
UNK: M. E Perlmutter : Castle, stop!
UNK: M. E Perlmutter : Do you not see the little orange cones around the body?
Castle : Is that actually his hand?
Perlmutter : That's the effect of LN2,
Perlmutter : commonly known as liquid nitrogen, a cryogenic refrigerant.
Perlmutter : It instantly freezes anything it comes in touch with,
Perlmutter : including Mr. Wolf. Made him fragile as glass.
Castle : This is, both literally and figuratively, cool.
Castle : Wolf was a follower of molecular gastronomy.
Castle : It's using the science to manipulate the...
Castle : And you don't care.
Perlmutter : It's usually pretty safe unless someone dumps it on you.
Beckett : Time of death?
Perlmutter : Well, all our normal indicators
Perlmutter : are contaminated by the LN2.
Perlmutter : I'll see what I can do once I get to the morgue.
Perlmutter : But we're gonna have to let him thaw a bit
Perlmutter : before we can move him.
Castle : - Looks like there was a struggle. - Robbery?
Ryan : No, no sign of forced entry, nothing's missing.
Ryan : According to Mr. Ridenhauer and Mr. Costa here,
Ryan : our victim stayed at the restaurant long after everyone else had left.
Beckett : - And what time was that? - It was around 11 : 00.
UNK: One of our clients had special ordered a cake,
UNK: and Wolf stayed behind to finish it up.
Castle : Aren't you the pastry chef?
Ridenhauer : Yeah, but I don't do crazy stuff like Wolf does.
