Beckett : 2 weeks ago?
Beckett : That's about the time that Wolf asked
Beckett : his foster brother, David, to buy his share.
Esposito : Yeah, and as soon as that check cleared,
Esposito : he withdrew that $40,000 in cash.
Ryan : On the day he was killed.
Castle : Why would someone need $40,000 in cash?
UNK: Well, nothing legal.
UNK: You know, Madison said that he would disappear every day
UNK: between 3 : 00 and 5 : 00 p.m.
UNK: Maybe where he went had something to do with the money.
Beckett : Why don't you guys talk to the kitchen staff again
UNK: and let's look into his credit card receipts.
UNK: Maybe we can figure out where he was going.
