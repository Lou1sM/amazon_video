Sandra : Are you gonna tell my husband?
Beckett : You're the primary suspect in a murder investigation.
Beckett : Your husband is the least of your worries.
Castle : So what happened that night, Sandra?
Castle : The sex turn deadly?
Sandra : No, there was no sex.
David : Two weeks ago, Wolf called me out of the blue
Sandra : to tell me we were through.
David : Two weeks?
UNK: I tried calling him, but he wouldn't call me back.
UNK: So, I went to the restaurant last night to find out why.
UNK: And?
Sandra : He said he was done screwing around,
Sandra : that it was time to grow up, turn over a new damn leaf.
Beckett : - And that clearly made you angry. - Sure.
Sandra : But I didn't kill him.
Beckett : Mrs. Meyers, you cheat on your husband on a regular basis.
Beckett : Why should we believe you?
UNK: Ask the doorman at my building.
UNK: I was back before 1 : 30.
UNK: When I left the restaurant at 1 : 15, Wolf was alive.
Esposito : Yo. Doorman confirms Mrs. Meyers' story,
Esposito : and the hospital has Dr. Meyers logged as working the graveyard shift.
Castle : Our lying, cheating wife was telling the truth.
Beckett : Yeah, but until we figure out Wolf's time of death,
Beckett : she's still our best suspect.
UNK: Hey, so I ran down Wolf's daily disappearance.
UNK: His credit card records show a charge at Cafe Rex
