Ridenhauer : I just... I made the cushion, and he sculpted the crown,
Ridenhauer : the heart and the jewels.
Ridenhauer : That's probably why he had the rotary evaporator out
Ridenhauer : and the liquid nitrogen.
Beckett : All right, after Perlmutter gets the body out,
Beckett : I'm gonna want CSU to come in and sweep for fibers and prints.
UNK: Juan Costa : - Yeah, yeah. - Yo, Beckett.
Esposito : The owner's here.
UNK: Madison Queller : - Say there's been an accident. Madison?
Madison : Becks? What are you doing here?
Beckett : I'm a homicide detective.
Madison : - Shut the front door. - I know.
Esposito : I know, right?
Madison : What a messed up way for us to reconnect.
Beckett : Madison Queller, this is Richard Castle.
Juan : - Hi. - Hi. Please call me Rick.
Castle : - How do you two know each other? - High school.
Madison : Ninth grade French.
Madison : I can't believe the biggest scofflaw at Stuy became a cop.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : So I'm gonna need contact information for all the restaurant staff.
Madison : Come on, Becks. You think somebody here might have done it?
Beckett : You know, no forced entry usually means
Beckett : that the killer either knew the chef, or was someone who had keys.
Beckett : So I'm gonna need alibis from everyone.
Beckett : - Including you, sorry. - No. No, I understand.
Madison : I was at a party until the wee hours. Lots of people saw me.
