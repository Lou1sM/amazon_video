Beckett : You know, I'm available for moral support,
Castle : and I've been dying to try out Rocco's new place.
Madison : A charming raconteur,
Madison : that's just what the doctor ordered. Thank you, Rick.
Castle : Unless that's a problem.
Beckett : No, not a problem.
Madison : Here it is.
Beckett : What was the exact nature of your relationship with Wolf?
Sandra : Food turns me on.
Sandra : Not as a sex toy, but the sensual act of cooking.
Sandra : how passionate he was with his ingredients, I fell in lust.
Sandra : My husband and I were the first through the doors when Q3 opened.
Sandra : And when Wolf came by to check on our meal,
Sandra : I slipped him my number.
Castle : Did you always have sex in the restaurant?
Sandra : Wolf did his best work in the kitchen.
Beckett : And your husband never suspected?
Sandra : When he's not working nights at the ER,
Sandra : he's conked out on sleeping pills.
Sandra : I could shoot porn in my living room, he'd have no idea.
