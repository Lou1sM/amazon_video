UNK: Wolf wasn't going to Cafe Rex to meet his girl.
Beckett : He was watching her out the cafe window.
Castle : That's why there were no phone calls.
Beckett : He was trying to gather up the courage to propose to her.
Beckett : So that's the store with the clearest view from the cafe.
Castle : Either our mystery girl works here,
Castle : or Wolf was really into women's clothes.
Castle : Maybe it's him.
Castle : Maybe that's Wolf's big secret.
Beckett : That's not his secret.
Rocco : She is.
Castle : - That's his foster brother's girlfriend. - Yep.
UNK: Well, it'd definitely make proposing tricky.
