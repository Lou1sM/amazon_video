Beckett : Well, then maybe I should get you to figure out
Beckett : why our victim was carrying a backpack full of cash.
Tom : Well, maybe you should.
Beckett : You know, I got some guys on the street.
Tom : If you want, I can put out feelers, see if anybody knows anything.
Beckett : Yeah, sure.
Esposito : Excuse me, detectives. - Hey, guys.
Esposito : Wow, nice candle.
Beckett : Come on in. What'd you find?
Esposito : We checked the sign-in log at that building
Esposito : where Jennifer Wong dropped off Wolf.
Esposito : Turns out he was seeing a guy named Simon Haim, Esquire.
Beckett : He was delivering a backpack full of cash to a lawyer?
Ryan : Well, according to Mr. Haim,
Ryan : Wolf had the backpack in his possession,
Ryan : but he never opened it and he never even mentioned the cash.
Esposito : But he did mention your high school friend, Madison.
Esposito : Apparently, Wolf wanted out of his contract.
Esposito : He wanted to leave the restaurant, and he wanted his investment back.
Tom : But the restaurant just opened. Why would he want to leave?
Ryan : Creative differences.
UNK: But Miss Queller refused to release him.
Ryan : Wolf was planning to sue.
Beckett : She'd built the restaurant on his reputation.
Beckett : If he left, she would've lost everything.
Beckett : So what happens to Q3 now that Wolf is dead?
Beckett : She had business insurance on him.
