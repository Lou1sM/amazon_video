UNK: Jeremy Preswick : would I put my money on my memory coming back, or not?
UNK: Dr. Holloway : There's no way to tell.
UNK: Dr. Holloway : You might eventually get it all back, or none of it. Or anything in between.
Beckett : Do we know why this would have happened?
UNK: Dr. Holloway : He's got a bump on the back of his head.
UNK: Dr. Holloway : It's usually a blow to the head coupled with psychological trauma,
UNK: Dr. Holloway : - which leads to amnesia. - Trauma?
Castle : You did get shot. Could that be it?
UNK: Dr. Holloway : If he believed he was going to die, then sure.
Castle : If we took him back to the scene of the crime,
Castle : could that jog his memory?
UNK: Possibly. But amnesia's a tricky condition.
UNK: Dr. Holloway : I'd like to take him back to Saint Vincent's,
UNK: Dr. Holloway : run some tests and scans, just to be safe.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Of course. I'll need to ask a few questions first.
Beckett : Mr... I'm sorry, I don't even know what to call you.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : I don't know what to call me, either.
Castle : You said his procedural memory is intact?
Beckett : - Yes. - May I?
UNK: Sure.
UNK: Just sign at the bottom.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Well, that's freaky. How the hell did I do that?
Beckett : - That looks like a real signature. - Well, it probably is.
UNK: Dr. Holloway : You sign your name so many times...
Castle : You form neural pathways. Procedural memory.
Beckett : So, he can't remember his name, but he can sign it?
UNK: Dr. Holloway : Mysteries of the brain.
Castle : It's illegible. Maybe you're a doctor.
Beckett : His first initial looks like a "J." Does that ring a bell?
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : - Nope. - Maybe we should just call you J.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : J. It's as good as anything, I guess.
