Castle : The guy is guilty of a murder he can't remember.
Castle : That just sucks. I mean, if you're gonna kill someone,
Castle : get caught, spend the rest of your life in prison,
Castle : at least you have the satisfaction of knowing why you did it.
Castle : Hatred. Revenge.
Castle : Hell, maybe he even cut you off on the highway.
Castle : But Jeremy won't even have that, even if we do find motive,

Beckett : I'm with you, Castle. It sucks.
Castle : - So, what next? - We submit the paperwork to the DA.
Castle : - But the DA will need motive, right? - Nope. Evidence speaks.
Beckett : - Smoking gun. - Don't you want to know why he did it?
Beckett : Yeah, but the truth is, is that we don't need it.
Castle : The DA doesn't need it. But you and me?
Castle : I know I couldn't sleep last night, could you?
Castle : There's got to be an answer here.
Castle : Something in his life that makes it all make sense.
Beckett : Hands! Show...

UNK: Prescription. Guess I have custody now.
Beckett : I'm sorry to surprise you. We didn't know you'd be here.
Beckett : - Are you okay? - Yeah.
UNK: I guess I just thought for half a second
UNK: that this would be a bizarre second chance for Jer and me.
UNK: - Stupid, right? - No, it's not stupid.
UNK: Then to find out that he's a murderer...
UNK: Emma Carnes : When I saw him again, I...
UNK: Emma Carnes : All those years of petty arguments that tore us apart didn't seem to matter.
UNK: Emma Carnes : It was like we first met. You know, I felt that thing.
UNK: Emma Carnes : And then we came here, and I saw that he didn't sell it
