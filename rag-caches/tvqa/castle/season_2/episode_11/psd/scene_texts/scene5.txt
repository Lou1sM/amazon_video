Beckett : Do you recognize this man?
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : - No. Should I? - His name is Victor Fink.
Beckett : He owned the art gallery where you were shot.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : - He was there with me? - He was shot and killed.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Oh, God.
Beckett : What about this man? Rocco Jones. He used to work at the gallery.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Guys, I feel so useless. Look, I'm really...
UNK: I'm really sorry. I just don't know him.
UNK: Wow.
Esposito : So, you finally get the courage to do it there, Rocco?
Rocco : Dude, come on. I was mad! I was just blowing off steam.
Esposito : You said you broke the law for him. How?
Esposito : Fine by me, pal. You have a nice trial.
Rocco : Come on. What... What the hell are you talking about?
Esposito : You threatened a guy. Then he turns up dead. Do the math.
UNK: Forgeries.
Rocco : Fink paid me to paint forgeries of high-end paintings.
Rocco : I was struggling, man. I needed the dough.
Esposito : - What'd he do with the copies? - Sold them.
Rocco : Passed them along to the buyer like they were the real thing.
Esposito : Who did he sell to?
UNK: Bahrain?
Beckett : So, he's the one who talked to Fink an hour before he was murdered.
Beckett : Maybe he figured out Fink was selling fakes and decided to get even.
Esposito : Doesn't matter.
Esposito : - The guy has full diplomatic immunity. - Great.
Ryan : So, I checked all the photo IDs of all of Fink's clients and artists.
Ryan : Our friend J isn't one of them.
Esposito : Then what was he doing at the gallery?
Ryan : Holloway called from the hospital.
Ryan : Aside from a minor head bump, J's got a clean bill of health.
Ryan : Well, other than the memory loss.
Beckett : You know, why don't you guys grab J, take him down to the crime scene.
Beckett : See if that sparks his memory.
UNK: And get ahold of Fink's assistant Darius.
Beckett : Tell him to meet you down there, with every file he has on Bahir Harun.
