Castle : - Uh, wrapping up a case. - Ah.
Martha : Well, you should kiss that girl while you're both young.
Castle : What's going on with you? What do you got there?
Martha : - Oh. It's from Chet. Isn't it romantic? - Chet sent you a dead flower?
Martha : It is the most romantic thing that anyone has ever done for me.
Castle : I've been up all night, so I might be a little slow.
UNK: Well, it's from the boutonniere I gave him, prom night.
Martha : He saved it, tucked it into a yearbook,
Martha : and he sent it over last night with a note saying,
UNK: would I give him a second chance?
Castle : Well, there's a lot of that going around these days.
UNK: And I'm scared. I mean, what if it doesn't work out?
