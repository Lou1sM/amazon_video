Beckett : And the second time was four hours after Detectives Ryan and Esposito
Beckett : brought Preswick to the gallery and you realized that he had lost his memory.
Beckett : You planted the gun.
Castle : Swing and a miss. Strike three. You're out.
Ryan : Ah. It's a beaut. - Isn't it?
Beckett : - I especially love the fingerprint. Me, too.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Even if I can't remember, it still somehow feels a part of me.
UNK: Emma Carnes : Hey, Jer. Ready to rock?
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : - Thanks for coming. - You remember Lucy?
Castle : - No. - She certainly remembers you.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Well, hey, thanks, guys.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : You made getting arrested for murder really not so bad.
Beckett : - Thank you. - Mmm-hmm.
Castle : - So are you two gonna... Castle.
UNK: Emma Carnes : It's okay. The answer is, who knows? I like him and he likes me.
UNK: Emma Carnes : - And right now, that's enough. Well, see you.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : I guess if I ever lose my memory again, I'll know where to come.
UNK: Act One [00 : - I... - Thanks. Later.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Thanks again for coming. Of course.
UNK: Hey.
Ryan : One of them has 15 years of baggage. Marriage. Divorce.
Ryan : The other's on a first date.
Ryan : - How long you think that'll last? - Hopefully for a long time.
Castle : Why, Detective Beckett, I had no idea you were a romantic.
Beckett : I also sleep with a gun. Bet you didn't know that either.
Ryan : How about you, Castle? How long you think it'll last?
Castle : Well, I guess it's just the writer in me, but I'm hoping for a happy ending.
Martha : Ooh! Well, well, well. Look who's doing the walk of shame now.
Castle : - I was with Beckett. - Really?
