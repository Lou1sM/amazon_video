Esposito : So, you finally get the courage to do it there, Rocco?
Rocco : Dude, come on. I was mad! I was just blowing off steam.
Esposito : You said you broke the law for him. How?
Esposito : Fine by me, pal. You have a nice trial.
Rocco : Come on. What... What the hell are you talking about?
Esposito : You threatened a guy. Then he turns up dead. Do the math.
UNK: Forgeries.
Rocco : Fink paid me to paint forgeries of high-end paintings.
Rocco : I was struggling, man. I needed the dough.
Esposito : - What'd he do with the copies? - Sold them.
Rocco : Passed them along to the buyer like they were the real thing.
Esposito : Who did he sell to?
