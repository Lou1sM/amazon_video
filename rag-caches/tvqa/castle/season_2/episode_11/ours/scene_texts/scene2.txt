Castle : and you wouldn't have to worry about getting scoliosis.
Alexis : Conceptually, I'd like a dog as much as you would.
Alexis : In reality, I'm not seeing the guy whose dishes never make it to the sink
Alexis : bending over to scoop poop in Hudson Park.
Castle : - I bet I could train him to use a toilet. - Oh.
UNK: - Gram! I thought you were sleeping in. - I was, just not in my room.
UNK: Angelica Fink : You know what? We all share way too much.
Martha : Oh, I'm sorry, kiddo. But my happiness cannot be contained.
Alexis : I'm going to school.
Alexis : - I'm glad you had a nice date. - Yes, three, four, five...
UNK: I am assuming from this walk of shame,
Castle : that you and your high school sweetheart, Chet,
Castle : had a lovely night, all night, talking.
Martha : - Among other things. - Mmm.
Castle : It's been a few weeks. Do I need to sit him down and ask him his intentions?
Martha : I am having way too much fun to worry about his intentions.
Martha : Okay, took me for lovely candlelight dinner,
Martha : horse and carriage ride through Central Park
Martha : where we watched the sun rise over the same boulder
Martha : where we shared our first kiss.
Castle : Wait, that's still his make-out spot? Mother, that's a red flag.
Martha : Honey, nothing you can say can spoil this for me.
Martha : I haven't felt this way since... I can't remember when.
Castle : Ah, amnesia. It's going around. Speaking of which, I'm off.
Castle : I'd tell you not to wait up, but clearly there would be no point.
