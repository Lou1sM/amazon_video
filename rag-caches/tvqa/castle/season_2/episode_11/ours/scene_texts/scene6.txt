Ryan : - Hey! Morning. - Hey. How was he last night?
Ryan : He slept like a rock.
Ryan : Doc Holloway stopped by this morning to give him a cognitive abilities test.
Ryan : Scored through the roof on the quantitative part.
Beckett : He's good at math, maybe he was an engineer,
Beckett : or in accounting or financing.
Ryan : Or just good at math.
Ryan : Castle's testing his drawing abilities. See if he's an artist.
Ryan : Maybe he was trying to convince Fink to show his work.
Beckett : I suppose we should be thankful he didn't offer to pose nude.
Ryan : Yeah. Thanks for that.
Beckett : - Radio silence. We gotta ID J. - Yeah.
Beckett : Speak of the devil. - Yeah.
Ryan : They've been showing it all morning.
Beckett : - Any calls yet? - No.
Beckett : Well, until we figure out who he is, we've got nothing.
Beckett : So, what's the verdict?
Esposito : - Wow. - You really captured his soul.
Castle : Okay, so you're not an artist. I'm sure you have many other talents.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : Just not a talent for remembering them.
UNK: That's him. No, no, that's him!
UNK: - Oh, thank God. - Can I help you?
Castle : I think we're about to find out who you are.
Beckett : Do you recognize her?
UNK: Yes, it's him. - No.
UNK: Jeremy Preswick : But then again, I don't recognize myself on the mirror.
Ryan : - Go ahead, ma'am. - Thanks.
UNK: Tory Westchester : Joel! Oh, my God!
Ryan : Tory Westchester. Wife.
UNK: Tory Westchester : I was so scared I lost you. Oh, sweetie.
UNK: Tory Westchester : So, it's true?
UNK: Tory Westchester : - You really don't remember anything? - He's suffering from amnesia.
UNK: Tory Westchester : I knew something was wrong. I knew it.
Castle : - J, are you crying? - I think I am.
Beckett : - Do you feel a connection? - Yeah. It's actually pretty overwhelming.
UNK: Tory Westchester : Of course it is, baby. I love you so much.
UNK: Tory Westchester : We will get through this, whatever it takes.
Beckett : Ms. Westchester, how long have the two of you been married?
UNK: Tory Westchester : Two years, this past October.
Beckett : - And you said his name was Joel... - Joel Westchester.
UNK: Tory Westchester : Oh, honey, look at you. You do remember me.
UNK: Tory Westchester : Love conquers all! Oh, it's all gonna be fine.
Beckett : - Are you okay? - What is it? What is it, my darling?
Castle : I think he's having an asthma attack.
Beckett : You have an inhaler in your pocket. Get it.
Castle : - Ms. Westchester, do you have cats? - Eight, like Jon and Kate.
Castle : - I think Joel here is allergic to cats. - Really?
Beckett : Ms. Westchester, you're not really married to him, are you?
UNK: Tory Westchester : I could be. I so could be! Why the hell shouldn't I be?
Ryan : She's been in and out of mental facilities for more than 10 years.
Ryan : Every personality disorder in the book. Sorry about that.
