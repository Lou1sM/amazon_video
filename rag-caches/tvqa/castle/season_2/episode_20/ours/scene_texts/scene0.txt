UNK: And did you hear? Our favorite golfer is in the news again.
UNK: Missed a charity tournament over the weekend.
UNK: Really unfortunate. The world's top golfer had to pull out.
UNK: In fact, it's the first time he's pulled out of anything in five years.
McPHEE : Oh, hello!
UNK: Ouch. Ouch. What do you think, Hank, should I take a mulligan?
Hank : No, play through, Bobby! Play through!
Bobby : I will, my friend. We have a great show for you tonight.
Kayla : Mr. Castle. Hi, I'm Kayla.
Kayla : - Please follow me. - Sure.
UNK: ...and my favorite writer, Richard Castle, is joining us.
Kayla : Here you go, Mr. Castle.
Kayla : Deb the makeup artist will take care of you from here.
Castle : - Thank you, Kayla. - And you're up right after Ms. Monroe.
Ellie : - Hi. It's Ellie. - Rick.
Ellie : Can I just say... Wow, like, I can't believe
Ellie : - I'm meeting you right now. - Really?
Ellie : Well, you're, like, my favorite author ever.
UNK: Can I tell you, I've seen every movie you've ever been in.
Castle : As soon as that snake ate you, the whole movie fell apart.
Bobby : Folks, please help me in welcoming Richard Castle.
Bobby : Rick Castle.
Martha : Oh, he looks good.
Bobby : - Welcome. - Thank you.
Castle : And you know what? I really loved writing it.
Bobby : Well, the paperback comes out July 27th. Right?
Castle : - July 27th, that's right. - And it's being made into a movie.
Castle : And they still won't let me carry a gun.
Ellie : I didn't know you worked with law enforcement.
UNK: It's kind of my weak spot.
Hank : Hello. Waiter, check please!
Bobby : Well, you guys are single, right?
Castle : Well, actually, not anymore, Bobby. Thank you very much.
Beckett : Wow. The camera really does add ten pounds...
Beckett : To his ego.
Alexis : Do you think he's asked her out yet?
Martha : Your father, pretty girl like that. He may have proposed by now.
Bobby : And that's our show for tonight.
Bobby : I'm Bobby Mann. Remember, folks,
Bobby : the boys will be back on duty tomorrow night.
Alexis : I always wonder what they're saying when they lean in like that.
Castle : - Thank you. - Thank you for coming.
Bobby : They want me dead.
Castle : - I'm sorry, what? - I'm serious.
Bobby : You work with cops, right? They want...
UNK: Bobby's Producer : That was a great show, guys! I'm so sorry about segment three.
UNK: Bobby's Producer : - Next time we put the emu in a diaper. - I'll call you.
UNK: Bobby's Producer : Oh, the box-in-box with Justin looked great.
Bobby : Good, good.
Castle : You're going orienteering, not library-ing.
Castle : You sure you want to take that many books?
UNK: Over-ambitious for a five-day trip?
UNK: You're going to be responsible for your own pack.
Castle : I think you're supposed to be more Sacagawea than a scholarly reader.
Castle : Besides, look at all those pages. The trees might want revenge.
UNK: Richard? - What's wrong?
