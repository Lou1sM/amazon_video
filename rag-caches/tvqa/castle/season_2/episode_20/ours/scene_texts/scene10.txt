Hank : What can I do for you?
Castle : Just came by to give you this. Bobby's idea book.
Castle : - We thought you might like it. - Thanks.
Beckett : We did have a question about what he wrote on the last page.
Castle : "The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night."
Beckett : Actually he crossed out "boys" and wrote "gang," "posse," and "crew."
Ryan : Any idea why?
Hank : - I guess we'll never know. - I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Castle : The network was pressuring Bobby to make a change.
Castle : They threatened to cancel him unless he did.
Beckett : And the night that he was murdered,
Beckett : he told Barbara that something awful was going on.
Beckett : He asked her if he was a good person. Why would he say that?
Hank : Because of Kayla.
Beckett : Not Kayla, Hank, because of you. He knew that he had to fire you.
