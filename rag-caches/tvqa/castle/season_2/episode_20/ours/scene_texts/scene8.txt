UNK: What about the hundred grand from Bobby Mann in your bank account?
Beckett : Am I in the right pond now?
Zach : That was for services rendered.
Castle : I don't think Webster's defines blackmailing as "a service."
Castle : More like a coercive threat, Mr. Rob-inson.
Zach : No, no. No, no. I never threatened Bobby. He hired me.
Beckett : To do what?
Beckett : My guys say that you don't have an alibi
Beckett : for the night that Mann was murdered.
Zach : You can't be serious.
Beckett : I guess it'll come out when we go to the murder trial.
Castle : Have a nice life... sentence.
Zach : What? No, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Zach : Look, he reached out to me. Said he needed some work done.
Beckett : What kind of work?
Zach : The kind that you get paid a lot extra to do.
Beckett : Something illegal.
UNK: Well...
Zach : Okay, look, he thought that somebody was out to get him.
Zach : He said he needed to know,
Zach : and so he paid me to bug a guy's office.
UNK: Who?
Montgomery : - Howard Weisberg. - The president of the network?
Zach : Easy gig, too. Bobby got me into the building.
Beckett : - When was this? - Week ago.
Castle : What did you do with the recordings?
Zach : - I delivered the CDs to Bobby. - When?
Zach : You know, the morning before he died.
