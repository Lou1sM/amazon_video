Montgomery : - Howard Weisberg. - The president of the network?
Zach : Easy gig, too. Bobby got me into the building.
Beckett : - When was this? - Week ago.
Castle : What did you do with the recordings?
Zach : - I delivered the CDs to Bobby. - When?
Zach : You know, the morning before he died.
Beckett : Bobby's producer said
UNK: that he locked himself in his office that morning.
Beckett : He was listening to the recording.
Castle : And then, they said he started acting paranoid after that.
Castle : So, what did he hear?
Zach : Am I good to go?
Ryan : Found the recordings in Mann's office, mixed in with his DVD collection.
Beckett : Heard anything yet that would explain
Beckett : why Mann was listening in on his boss?
Ryan : Nah. Just a bunch of talk about setting up breakfasts, lunches,
Ryan : dinners, and drinks with writers, actors, and directors.
Beckett : Where are we on the blackmail?
UNK: Oh, we got uniforms running down all show employees
UNK: who could've had access to the studio to take that photo.
Esposito : Yo. You guys are gonna want to hear this.
Castle : Well, no wonder Bobby thought Mickey was disloyal.
Beckett : And no wonder he thought someone wanted him dead. Someone did.
Beckett : Looks like you got your wish, Mr. Weisberg.
UNK: Lawyer Weisberg : Detective, none of the recordings are admissible in court.
UNK: Now, relax, Burt. I didn't kill anyone, okay?
Weisberg : Save it for when I actually do. Detective, I wasn't serious.
Beckett : Bobby thought you were.
UNK: Well, then maybe he shouldn't have been bugging my office.
UNK: Hell, in private, I issue a dozen death sentences a day
UNK: on under-performing, overpaid jackasses at my network.
UNK: Now, what I wanted was Mickey Reed pulled to 11 : 30,
UNK: but Bobby had an $80 million penalty on his contract.
Castle : Which still had another five years left on it.
Weisberg : Yeah. Now, what I did was lean on Bobby for a few months
