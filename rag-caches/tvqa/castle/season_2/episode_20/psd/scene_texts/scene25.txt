Castle : You are a better actress than I thought when I recommended you.
Ellie : Well, you should know I wasn't acting the whole time.
Castle : Me neither.
Ellie : - Thanks, Rick. Take care. - You, too.
UNK: Bye.
UNK: Hey. Dad, was that...
Castle : My Sacagawea has returned! Oh, my God, my best girl!
Castle : I missed you so much! Oh, my God, I'm so glad you're home.
Alexis : I missed you, too, Dad.
Castle : - You're not just saying that, are you? - What...
UNK: Ms. Marks : I don't care.
Castle : - Tell me you're hungry. - I'm starving!
Castle : Come with me. Tell me everything!
