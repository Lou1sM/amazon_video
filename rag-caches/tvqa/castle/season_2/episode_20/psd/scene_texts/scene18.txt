Castle : the only reason you're with me is, you know,
Castle : for the part in the movie.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: Really?
Ellie : What does this friend of yours base that on?
UNK: You know what? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have repeated that.
Ellie : - Does this friend know me? - No.
Ellie : Has he read anything about me that would make him think
Ellie : that I would prostitute myself for a role?
UNK: No, of course not. You know, I... He's an idiot.
Ellie : Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a woman in Hollywood?
UNK: Ellie...
UNK: Beckett!
Castle : Oh, yeah. He looks like a Zach Robinson.
Castle : Where'd you find him?
Beckett : The boys caught up with him at a craps table at Mohegan Sun.
Castle : Already gambling away his hard-earned blackmail money.
Beckett : So, how was your date with your little starlet?
UNK: - How could you tell this time? - Like I said, Castle,
Beckett : trained detective.
Castle : Well, it went lovely.
Castle : - No thanks to you. - What did I have to do with it?
Castle : Pulled your Jedi mind trick on me. Made me doubt Ellie's honesty.
Castle : Foolishly, I told her what you said, made her cry.
Beckett : Castle, she's an actress. A professional liar.
Beckett : She's paid to cry on cue.
UNK: Zach Robinson : No. I've never seen this picture before.
Beckett : Really? You sure you didn't use it to blackmail Bobby Mann?
UNK: Blackmail. Fishing in the wrong pond, Detective.
UNK: What about the hundred grand from Bobby Mann in your bank account?
Beckett : Am I in the right pond now?
Zach : That was for services rendered.
Castle : I don't think Webster's defines blackmailing as "a service."
Castle : More like a coercive threat, Mr. Rob-inson.
Zach : No, no. No, no. I never threatened Bobby. He hired me.
