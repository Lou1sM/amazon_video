UNK: Parking garage at 1525 Broadway confirms
UNK: Bobby Mann pulled in at 1 : 37 a.m. And he never came back for his car.
Beckett : And what's at 1525 Broadway?
Ryan : The park-view penthouse of Mickey Reed,
Castle : Oh, Mickey, not so fine.
UNK: Doorman let Bobby up to his place at 1 : 45 a.m.
UNK: Neighbors complained of a loud argument.
UNK: Bobby left a little after 2 : 00.
Beckett : So, Mickey lied to us.
Beckett : He saw Bobby somewhere right in the middle of our kill zone.
Castle : You think he was a good host, offered Bobby a drink?
Mickey : This set looks like an old-age home.
Mickey : Everything needs to be updated.
Mickey : No purple, no suede, no faux finish! And get rid of this stupid thing.
Beckett : Measuring drapes already, Mr. Reed?
Mickey : Like it or not, Detective,
Mickey : the network wants me to take over Bobby's time-slot next week,
Mickey : right after the tribute.
Mickey : I know it seems callous, but it's what Bobby would've wanted.
Castle : - Even over his dead body. - Excuse me?
Beckett : Why did you lie to us about seeing Mann the other night?
UNK: Okay, look, I'm sorry.
Mickey : But I lied because I didn't want it getting out.
Castle : That you two were fighting?
Mickey : It's hard enough filling the man's shoes around here.
Mickey : I don't need the tabloids writing about us getting into it
Mickey : on the night he died. So, I lied. So what?
