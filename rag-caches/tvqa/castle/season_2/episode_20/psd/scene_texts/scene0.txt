UNK: And did you hear? Our favorite golfer is in the news again.
UNK: Missed a charity tournament over the weekend.
UNK: Really unfortunate. The world's top golfer had to pull out.
UNK: In fact, it's the first time he's pulled out of anything in five years.
McPHEE : Oh, hello!
UNK: Ouch. Ouch. What do you think, Hank, should I take a mulligan?
Hank : No, play through, Bobby! Play through!
Bobby : I will, my friend. We have a great show for you tonight.
Kayla : Mr. Castle. Hi, I'm Kayla.
Kayla : - Please follow me. - Sure.
UNK: ...and my favorite writer, Richard Castle, is joining us.
Kayla : Here you go, Mr. Castle.
Kayla : Deb the makeup artist will take care of you from here.
Castle : - Thank you, Kayla. - And you're up right after Ms. Monroe.
Ellie : - Hi. It's Ellie. - Rick.
Ellie : Can I just say... Wow, like, I can't believe
Ellie : - I'm meeting you right now. - Really?
Ellie : Well, you're, like, my favorite author ever.
UNK: Can I tell you, I've seen every movie you've ever been in.
Castle : As soon as that snake ate you, the whole movie fell apart.
Bobby : Folks, please help me in welcoming Richard Castle.
Bobby : Rick Castle.
Martha : Oh, he looks good.
Bobby : - Welcome. - Thank you.
Castle : And you know what? I really loved writing it.
Bobby : Well, the paperback comes out July 27th. Right?
Castle : - July 27th, that's right. - And it's being made into a movie.
Castle : And they still won't let me carry a gun.
Ellie : I didn't know you worked with law enforcement.
UNK: It's kind of my weak spot.
Hank : Hello. Waiter, check please!
