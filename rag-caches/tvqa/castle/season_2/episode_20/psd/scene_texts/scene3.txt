Castle : killed with an undetectable poison that stopped the heart.
Castle : What if that's what happened to Mann?
Beckett : Need I remind you that you make up stuff for a living?
Beckett : And there is no such poison in real life.
Beckett : And if there was, there would be a whole slew of angry spouses
Beckett : who'd be getting away with murder.
Castle : Could you just have Lanie take a closer look? Please?
Lanie : You know how many strings I had to pull for this, Castle?
Castle : If I'm wrong, I'll reimburse the city.
Lanie : To hell with the city. It's me you're gonna owe.
