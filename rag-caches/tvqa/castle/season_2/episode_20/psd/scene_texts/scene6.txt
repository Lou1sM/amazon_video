UNK: she was able to narrow the window of poisoning
UNK: down between 1 : 30 and 4 : 30 in the morning.
UNK: That makes this
Beckett : our kill zone.
UNK: 1 : 30 to 4 : 30. What else?
Esposito : The lab said that there was no traces of cranberry juice
Esposito : or balsamic vinegar in the gum we found in Mann's pocket,
Esposito : so he must have chewed that before he was poisoned.
UNK: Well, we know he left the studio at 12 : 45.
Esposito : Which means he wasn't poisoned there.
Beckett : And we know that his home security records
Beckett : show that he never made it there.
UNK: 12 : 45 to 4 : 50 in the morning. Leaves in his car, is found on foot.
UNK: So, what was he doing that whole time?
Ryan : So, the vehicle locator in Mann's Bugatti is not sending a signal.
Esposito : Probably in an underground parking garage.
Beckett : Which means it could be anywhere.
Beckett : All right, check his cell phone, see if he made any calls last night,
Beckett : and then go to his brownstone.
Beckett : Castle and I will head to the studio and see what we can dig up there.
Beckett : - Oh, guys... - Yeah.
Beckett : No talk of murder. The longer we can keep this
Beckett : away from the press, the better off we'll be.
UNK: Bobby's Producer : I'm sorry. I don't know where he went after the show last night.
UNK: Bobby's Producer : What is this about, anyway? I thought Bobby
UNK: Bobby's Producer : died of a heart attack, right?
Beckett : We're just tying up loose ends for the coroner.
Castle : How was Mr. Mann acting recently? Did you notice anything unusual?
UNK: Bobby's Producer : No, he was great.
UNK: Bobby's Producer : - Except yesterday. - What happened yesterday?
UNK: Bobby's Producer : I don't know. I mean, he spent the morning
UNK: Bobby's Producer : locked up in his office alone, and then the rest of the day
