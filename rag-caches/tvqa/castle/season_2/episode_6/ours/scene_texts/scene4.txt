Castle : You're, uh, sanguinarians?
Castle : Blood drinkers.
UNK: All of our blood-play is legal and consensual.
Beckett : We're not here about the club.
Beckett : Do you know somebody named Matthew Freeman?
Beckett : - Who? - Crow.
Vixen : Crow? Sure, why? Is he in some kind of trouble?
Castle : We found him in a cemetery. Someone put a stake through his heart.
Vixen : What is this, some kind of joke? "Let's go make fun of the vampires"?
Beckett : It's not a joke.
Vixen : No way. What?
Vixen : Who would want to kill Crow like that?
Castle : We were hoping you could tell us.
Beckett : Where were you last night between 11 : 00 p.m. And midnight?
Vixen : I was here. Wait, you don't think I'm responsible?
Castle : We found synthetic hairs on his body from a black wig
Castle : and bites on his thigh.
Vixen : But I didn't kill him. He was one of my lovers.
Beckett : So, you saw him yesterday?
UNK: Mid-afternoon. He left at 3 : 30. Oh, my God. That's so awful.
UNK: Vixen. - He's really dead?
Beckett : We have a witness who told us that you were fighting recently.
Vixen : Yes, because he'd been seeing someone else.
Vixen : Ultimately, we forgave him. Yesterday, we were making up.
Vixen : That's why you found my hair on him.
Beckett : You said he was seeing someone else?
UNK: Daemon. Daemon fell in love with Crow and his art
UNK: and talked him into writing a graphic novel.
Vixen : That's why he's dead.
Vixen : only the guy that they were basing it on was real and dangerous.
UNK: A real vampire?
