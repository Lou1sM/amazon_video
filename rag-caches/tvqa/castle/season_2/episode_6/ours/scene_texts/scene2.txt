UNK: Coven?
Ryan : Yeah, a vampire coven is like joining a church or a club.
UNK: "You like to play golf? I like to play golf.
UNK: "You like to drink blood? I like to drink blood."
Ryan : What? I used to go out with a girl who was into the lifestyle.
UNK: Dr Frank : What happened? Did the relationship suck?
UNK: Oh!
Ryan : Deal breaker, she wanted to have sex in a coffin.
UNK: I'm open-minded, I'm not that open-minded.
Beckett : All right, did our mistress of the night have a phone number or an address?
UNK: Uh, only an e-mail. However, there is information
Ryan : on the coven's next gathering, which meets tonight.
Ryan : Damn. You need a password.
Esposito : Or an old girlfriend.
UNK: Hey. Whoa. I haven't seen her in, like, a year.
UNK: They're gonna go ahead and process that.
UNK: Fine. But I'm not sleeping with her.
