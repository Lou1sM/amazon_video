UNK: Okay.
UNK: What'd you get a hit on?
UNK: The prints from the stake in Crow's heart.
UNK: - Your girl Vixen was right. - Morgan Lockerby.
Esposito : Only thing is, he's one of the great un-findables.
Esposito : No address, no phone number, no trail.
UNK: Maybe not. Here. Recognize that corner?
Beckett : That's Broome and Clinton, Lower East Side.
Castle : I think Crow may have drawn us a road map to Morlock.
UNK: It's that way.
Beckett : You've gotta be kidding me.
Ryan : You think he's in there?
UNK: It is daytime. If he thinks he's a vampire, that's where he'd be.
Beckett : I'll cover you.
Castle : - Together? - All right. On three.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: One. Two. Three.
Ryan : You see him jump? Real macho, Castle.
UNK: - Hey! Get him off! - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
UNK: - Get him off! Get him! - Get him off of him!
Castle : - He bit me. - Look!
Esposito : He is a vampire!
Lanie : He's not a vampire.
Esposito : But his skin burned when the light hit him.
Lanie : He has porphyria, some people call it "the vampire disease."
Lanie : Its symptoms include extreme photosensitivity.
Lanie : The skin blisters when it's exposed to the sun.
Lanie : Victims are prone to hallucinations, paranoia...
Beckett : - That explains his psych diagnosis. - Exactly how contagious is it?
Lanie : It's a genetic disease.
Lanie : Besides, I put enough antibiotics on that bite to kill a small animal.
Lanie : Now, if we're done here,
UNK: I gotta head back to the slab and see a man about a corpse.
Beckett : Thank you, Dr. Parish. Castle was totally freaked out.
Castle : You wanna bite me, you buy me dinner.
UNK: Mr. Lockerby.
Beckett : Morlock, do you know somebody named Crow?
UNK: You heartless bitch! Spots all over.
Morlock : - Spots all over. - Were you in the cemetery with Crow?
Morlock : Blood all over! Blood all over!
UNK: There's been a murder, Mr. Lockerby. Do you understand that?
Beckett : Were you in the cemetery with Crow?
