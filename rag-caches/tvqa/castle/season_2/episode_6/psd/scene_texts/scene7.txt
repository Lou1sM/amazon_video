Castle : We were hoping you could tell us.
Beckett : Where were you last night between 11 : 00 p.m. And midnight?
Vixen : I was here. Wait, you don't think I'm responsible?
Castle : We found synthetic hairs on his body from a black wig
Castle : and bites on his thigh.
Vixen : But I didn't kill him. He was one of my lovers.
