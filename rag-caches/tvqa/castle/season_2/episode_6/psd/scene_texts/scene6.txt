Beckett : Do you know somebody named Matthew Freeman?
Beckett : - Who? - Crow.
Vixen : Crow? Sure, why? Is he in some kind of trouble?
Castle : We found him in a cemetery. Someone put a stake through his heart.
Vixen : What is this, some kind of joke? "Let's go make fun of the vampires"?
Beckett : It's not a joke.
Vixen : No way. What?
