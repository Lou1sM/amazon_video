UNK: And he sounded upset.
UNK: But we never found out why.
Esposito : Tough one. - Yeah, they're all tough.
Beckett : - So, you got anything? - Yeah, Vixen's alibi checked out.
UNK: We've been talking to Crow's coven friends
Esposito : and searching through vampire Web sites.
UNK: - So far, no Daemon. - What about Lockerby?
UNK: Morgan Lockerby, psychiatric disorder, 35, committed by the state.
Esposito : That's the good news.
Esposito : Bad news is, he escaped a few years back. Nobody's seen him since.
Beckett : - Got an address on file? - No, he's completely off grid.
Esposito : - What's your shadow doing? - I don't know.
Beckett : Last time I saw him, he was sifting through evidence
Beckett : from Crow's apartment.
Esposito : - So, are you going? - To what?
Esposito : His Halloween party.
UNK: Dr Frank : I don't know. Throws a lot of parties. You?
Esposito : Are you kidding? I'm all over that.
UNK: - What are you gonna wear? - You wanna know, you gotta show
UNK: to see what I got going on.
UNK: Hot on the case, Castle?
UNK: On the case of a good read. It's actually not bad.
UNK: Esposito found Morgan Lockerby.
UNK: You mean "Morlock."
UNK: Vixen was right.
UNK: You smell like cherries.
