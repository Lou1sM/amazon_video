UNK: So, how can I possibly tell him that Janice wasn't his mother?
UNK: Alan Freeman : That his real mother ran away?
Lawson : Are we through here, Detective?
Beckett : Not by a long shot, Lawson. The Connecticut State Police
UNK: found a 9-millimeter handgun in your client's home,
Beckett : and I am just betting that that is the same gun
Beckett : that killed Elizabeth Dryden McGinty and Jonas Westfall.
UNK: Detective Javier Esposito : - No, I... - Don't say anything, Alan.
UNK: Oh, yeah, and there's also this.
Beckett : Your son witnessed his mother's murder.
UNK: Alan Freeman : No. That's not possible.
UNK: How... How is this possible?
UNK: Here, thank you.
UNK: Janice Freeman : Excuse me.
UNK: How much longer are you people gonna keep us waiting
UNK: without letting us know what is going on?
Beckett : We are trying to find the answers, Mrs. Freeman.
Morlock : - Spots. - What?
Castle : "Spots all over. Blood all over.
UNK: "I should've buried you then, you wicked boy."
Beckett : What are you talking about?
Castle : Morlock's crazy talk. It's just like Paige's drunk talk.
Castle : You have to translate it.
Castle : - Is Morlock still in holding? - Yeah.
UNK: cut To : Mrs. Freeman, I am so sorry this is taking so long.
UNK: But as long as you have to wait, you might as well be comfortable.
UNK: Have you seen our vending machines?
UNK: Straight through here. Right, just to the left here.
UNK: Perfect, right in there. Excellent. Straight through.
UNK: Oh! Wrong turn.
UNK: Heartless bitch! Spots murdered the Crow! Murderer! Murderer!
UNK: What a small world.
Beckett : Here you go. Thank you.
UNK: Why?
Beckett : She killed Elizabeth so that she could have you to herself.
Beckett : And then she murdered Matthew and his friend Daemon
Beckett : so that you would never find out.
Beckett : Matthew didn't know who to trust, so he asked Daemon to hide the evidence,
UNK: which ended up being smarter than he ever realized.
