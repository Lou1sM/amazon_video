Beckett : So, you saw him yesterday?
UNK: Mid-afternoon. He left at 3 : 30. Oh, my God. That's so awful.
UNK: Vixen. - He's really dead?
Beckett : We have a witness who told us that you were fighting recently.
Vixen : Yes, because he'd been seeing someone else.
Vixen : Ultimately, we forgave him. Yesterday, we were making up.
Vixen : That's why you found my hair on him.
Beckett : You said he was seeing someone else?
UNK: Daemon. Daemon fell in love with Crow and his art
UNK: and talked him into writing a graphic novel.
Vixen : That's why he's dead.
Vixen : only the guy that they were basing it on was real and dangerous.
UNK: A real vampire?
UNK: He thinks he is. His name's Morgan Lockerby.
UNK: He was an original member of this coven, but something happened to him.
