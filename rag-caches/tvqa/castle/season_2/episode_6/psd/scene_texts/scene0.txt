UNK: Alexis Castle : - Hey. - Hey.
UNK: I was... I was just trying on my Halloween costume.
Alexis : - What exactly are you supposed to be? - Space cowboy.
Alexis : Okay. A, there are no cows in space. B, didn't you wear that, like,
Alexis : - five years ago? - So?
Alexis : So, don't you think you should move on?
Castle : I like it. What are you doing up so late, anyway?
Castle : Have you decided what you're gonna dress up as this year?
Castle : Perhaps Indira Gandhi? Amelia Earhart? Hermione?
UNK: I think I'm gonna skip it.
Castle : - Skip Halloween? - Well, dressing up.
Alexis : I'll still hand out candy at the door,
Alexis : but I'm too old to go trick-or-treating anymore.
UNK: You know how we feel when the big kids come. I don't wanna be that kid.
Castle : But you have to go with me. You are my candy beard.
UNK: Sorry, Dad, you're just gonna have to get another beard.
Castle : This discussion is not over.
Castle : So, have you come up with a name for your parenting project baby egg yet?
UNK: Wait! Let me guess. Zac Eggfron? No, Egg Begley Junior?
Alexis : I went Dickensian. Paige and I are calling him Feggin. Get it?
Alexis : - Feggin? - Fake baby egg.
UNK: Wouldn't that be "Fa-keg"?
Castle : Beckett, what are you doing up so late?
Castle : I just love this time of year. Crunchy leaves underfoot,
Castle : the crisp, clean air, smell of jack-o'-lanterns all aflame.
UNK: Detective Kate Beckett : Yeah, well, you wouldn't say that if you were a cop.
UNK: Halloween's one of the worst weeks of the year for us.
UNK: So, the body's already in a graveyard. Someone's trying to save some time.
