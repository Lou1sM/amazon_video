Sky : I think I might have killed her.
Beckett : How did you kill her?
Sky : I told her to do the world a favor and drop dead. And then she did.
Sky : It's funny, she usually doesn't listen to me.
Castle : Why would you tell her to drop dead? She's your sister.
Sky : - She was an ass. - When did you see her last?
Sky : I don't know, Wednesday, Thursday. What day is it today?
Beckett : Where'd you see her?
Sky : She found me selling a bracelet that she bought me for my birthday.
