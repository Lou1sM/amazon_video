Castle : Are you sure Zack said she was crashing here?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: It's over there.
Beckett : Sky. Sky!
UNK: Hey, you okay? Can you hear me?
UNK: How much did you take?
Sky : McGinnis gave us a signing bonus.
Sky : He told us a place we could fix for cheap.
Sky : I couldn't do it. No, Hayley didn't want me to.
Sky : I'm clean.
Sky : She's gonna help me, right?
UNK: Ian Busch : Wherever she is, she's looking out for me, right?
Beckett : She's already doing it.
