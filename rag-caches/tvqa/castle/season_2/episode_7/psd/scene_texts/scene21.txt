UNK: Right. The Gillespies' sweet sixteen.
Beckett : You took three half-hour breaks in between sets,
Beckett : during which no one remembers seeing you.
Beckett : You could have easily slipped away and killed Hayley.
Zack : Nobody saw me because I didn't want to spark up a pipe
Zack : in front of a bunch of teenagers.
Castle : Well, your innate sense of decency is inspiring.
Beckett : Why did you talk to John McGinnis the day before Hayley was killed?
Zack : - He's my manager! Is that a crime? Ex-manager.
Beckett : He let all you guys go after Hayley disbanded the group.
Beckett : So, why did he call you, Zack?
Beckett : I'll tell you why.
Beckett : You both needed to get rid of Hayley to get the band name back.
Beckett : And he called with a plan.
Zack : Okay, look, fine. He had a plan, but it wasn't to kill Hayley.
Zack : - He wanted to find Sky. - Why?
Zack : He heard that Sky and Hayley were talking again.
