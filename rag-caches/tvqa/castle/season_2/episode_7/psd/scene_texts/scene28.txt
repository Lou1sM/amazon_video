UNK: Bree Busch : Well, I don't think it's ever been replaced.
Castle : Yeah, it has. It's newer than the other ones.
UNK: Bree Busch : Could you be careful, please? That's expensive equipment.
Beckett : Castle, what are you doing?
UNK: Apparently, I'm uncovering a bullet hole.
Beckett : Judging from the diameter of the hole, it's a.38.
Castle : That gunpowder residue on Hayley's hand?
Castle : This is where the gun was fired.
UNK: Bree Busch : I have no idea how that bullet hole got there.
Beckett : You and Hayley fought. You knew that if she walked out of that door,
Beckett : you would never see her again, and so you grabbed her from behind.
Beckett : She pulled out a gun. It scared you, you held her tight.
Beckett : A shot went off, you held her tighter still.
Beckett : And before you even knew what happened, she stopped struggling.
Beckett : You broke her neck without realizing it.
