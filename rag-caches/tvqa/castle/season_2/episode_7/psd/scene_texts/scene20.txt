Beckett : Let's go find out.
Zack : What is your problem, you freak?
Zack : You are completely mental!
Sky : Who the hell do you think you are, loser?
Zack : Don't you walk away. I'm talking to you.
Sky : Get the hell away from me!
Sky : You touch me again, and I swear to God, I will kill you!
Beckett : - Hey! Hey, hey! Hey! It's okay! - Screw you, you stupid whore!
UNK: Franco Marquez : - Zack! Stop!
Beckett : Hey. Sky!
Sky : - No, leave me alone! - What did you do to her?
Zack : Nothing, man! She attacked me.
Zack : We were riffing on one of Hayley's songs.
Zack : One minute, she's singing along, the next minute, she goes postal,
Zack : starts telling me I'm stealing from Hayley. She's crazy!
Castle : It doesn't look good, Zack. Beating up one Blue, killing another.
Zack : - Look, I already told you guys... - Sit down! Sit!
Beckett : Now talk.
Zack : I already told you guys, I didn't kill Hayley.
UNK: Okay? I was at the birthday gig, remember?
