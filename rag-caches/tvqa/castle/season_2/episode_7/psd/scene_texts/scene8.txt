Esposito : There's only one reason you go to the cops, to report a crime.
Beckett : Or to get help because you think you're in danger.
Zack : Careful with that guitar when you put that away.
Zack : We heard about what happened to Hayley.
Zack : - It sucks, right? - Can I get you a tissue?
Beckett : We have a witness who saw you guys fighting.
Alexis : - So? - So, she's dead now.
Zack : - Well, I didn't kill her. You sure about that?
Castle : You sure you didn't get a little high,
Castle : maybe pull a Hulk smash on your band mate?
Zack : Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.
Beckett : Where were you between midnight and 3 : 00 a.m. On Sunday night?
UNK: We had a gig.
UNK: Gillespie's sweet sixteen over on 82nd.
UNK: We finished around 1 : 30. We packed up and we were out by 2 : 00.
UNK: Me and Nick shared a cab to Williamsburg.
UNK: I paid with a credit card. Are we done?
Castle : Wow. Sweet sixteen parties.
Castle : When Hayley was with the band, weren't you opening for Pink?
Zack : What do you guys want me to say, okay?
Zack : She screwed all of us when she had her little meltdown
Zack : and decided to go solo. Do I hate her? Yes.
Zack : - Did I kill her? No. - What'd you guys fight about?
UNK: Her being a selfish bitch.
Zack : She found out that we were holding auditions for her replacement,
Zack : and she had those d-bag producers send us a cease-and-resist letter.
Castle : Or a cease-and-desist letter.
Zack : We made the reputation for the name Blue Pill, but she owned it.
Zack : So, what? She has a meltdown and disappears off the map,
Zack : and we can't use our own damn name?
Zack : - Hell, we can't even get arrested now. - Poor choice of words.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Hayley's sister is on her way to the morgue to identify the body.
