Zack : He wanted me to grease her wheels a bit.
Castle : What, with your vast array of charms?
Zack : McGinnis wanted me to give her dope,
Zack : and have her talk to Hayley, and get the band name back.
Zack : He knew that the only way to get to Hayley was through Sky.
Zack : So, I got her wasted, okay? A little too wasted.
Zack : And I went to go see Hayley myself.
Beckett : You saw Hayley the night that she was killed?
Beckett : You should've told us that, Zack.
Zack : What, make me look even more guilty to you guys?
Zack : No. I watch TV, I know how the jury works.
Zack : These are the little things that get you convicted.
Castle : - So does lying to cops. - Keep going. Spill it.
Zack : She was at a coffee house. She was writing songs again.
Zack : Everything was fine until her phone rang.
Castle : - What happened? - She freaked.
Zack : She hit "ignore," but every time she did, it just rang again.
Zack : And every time it rang, she just flipped out even more.
Castle : - You have any idea who it was? - Yeah.
Zack : Because they called so many times, I saw the caller ID.
Zack : It scared me when I saw it, too.
