Beckett : She was 100% clean and sober.
Castle : Then why was she giving a wad of cash to Tony the drug dealer?
Tony : She didn't want drugs. She wanted a gun.
Tony : - A gun? - And not a punkass.22, either.
UNK: A.38. She wanted to put a hole in a brother.
Tony : Seeing as she's dead, I say I did the right thing at the time.
Tony : - The girl was scared. - Of what?
Tony : Didn't say, and I didn't ask. She just wanted the gun.
Castle : Are you sure?
UNK: No, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, I just...
UNK: Hello?
Beckett : He just hung up on me.
Castle : There's a reason he hangs out with dead people.
Castle : So, what did he say?
Beckett : He identified the lipstick that was used to paint a smile on Hayley's face
Beckett : as Daniella Bolan's Velvet Kiss lipstick, Lava Red.
Castle : Yes, but what about the gun? What'd he say about the gun?
Beckett : Oh. Thought you'd never ask.
Beckett : They found gunpowder residue on Hayley's hands.
Castle : So not only did she buy a gun, but she used it.
Castle : But why didn't we find it?
Beckett : That's because we didn't find her where she was killed.
Beckett : So, someone attacked her, someone that she was afraid of.
Beckett : She tries to shoot them.
Beckett : And in the struggle, the assailant breaks her neck,
Beckett : drags her down an alleyway, hangs her upside down,
Beckett : paints a smile on her face,
Beckett : which apparently was a lot like a music video
Beckett : that has nothing to do with our murder.
