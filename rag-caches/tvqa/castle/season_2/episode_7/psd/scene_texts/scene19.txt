Beckett : Except for Hayley. Because she's dead.
UNK: John Mcginnis : Which will no doubt help us sell lots of tickets
UNK: John Mcginnis : when the band goes back on tour.
Beckett : Is that why you killed her?
UNK: John Mcginnis : Now, I know my rights here and I'm done talking.
UNK: John Mcginnis : You think you've got a case, arrest me.
UNK: John Mcginnis : I would love to have that kind of publicity!
Castle : I never fully appreciated the nuances of the word "skeevy" until just now.
Beckett : Hey, Ryan, did you get the phone records
Beckett : for John McGinnis and McGinnis Management?
Ryan : Yeah, I just got them.
Castle : - You don't think he did it? - He challenged me to arrest him.
Beckett : He's probably screwed and figures bluffing is his best bet.
Beckett : Ryan, let's cross-reference his calls with our hit list.
Beckett : Find out if he was in contact with anyone from Hayley's inner circle.
Castle : What about him being in Philadelphia?
Beckett : With the right connections you can kill with a phone call.
Ryan : Yeah, right here.
Ryan : Looks like the day before Hayley died,
Ryan : McGinnis put in a 10-minute phone call to Zack, the guitarist.
Beckett : He hasn't represented the band in months.
Castle : Why would he call Zack the day before Hayley died?
