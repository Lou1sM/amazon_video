Beckett : Where were you after midnight last night?
UNK: Franco Marquez : She played a set at the Bitter End last night.
UNK: Franco Marquez : A brand new song. It was like a total surprise.
UNK: Franco Marquez : Like, there was no e-mail blast or nothing, so I wasn't there.
Beckett : I asked you where you were, not where you weren't.
UNK: Franco Marquez : Someone recorded the concert and posted it online.
UNK: Franco Marquez : It's gone totally viral already. So, that's where I was.
UNK: Franco Marquez : At home in my room, listening to Hayley's final show.
Castle : You say "final show" like you knew it was gonna be her last.
UNK: Franco Marquez : I did know, so did Hayley.
