Castle : - What promises would she make? - She said that I could come back.
Sky : She said that we were gonna be a team.
Sky : But I had to get clean.
Sky : "You gotta clean up, baby girl. You're gonna end up dead."
Sky : Hmm. Thus, irony.
Sky : How was I supposed to get clean when she couldn't even do it?
Beckett : Wait a minute, she was using again?
Sky : Yeah. She was with Tony the day after I saw her.
Beckett : - Who's Tony? - My dealer.
Sky : She was handing him a wad of cash.
Castle : I was just thinking, if she was using again,
Castle : that would explain why she left her producers,
Castle : but not why she was killed, who killed her, or why she went to the police.
UNK: What I just said was not confusing enough
UNK: for your face to do what it's doing.
Beckett : That was Perlmutter.
Beckett : The tox results just got back from the lab.
Beckett : There were no drugs in Hayley's system.
