Zack : It said it was Death calling.
Castle : I thought she didn't have a phone.
Beckett : She probably had a pay-as-you-go plan, paid cash,
Beckett : and gave the phone company false information.
Castle : Well, that makes sense if she was hiding from Death
Castle : and trying to stay off the grid, like Sky said.
Beckett : Okay, so obviously, there's a human being at the other end of the phone.
Beckett : And whoever it is probably tracked her down and then killed her.
Beckett : So, who had the dubious distinction of being known by Hayley as Death?
Castle : Okay, well, how does the song go? "Death, she grows near."
