UNK: Bree Busch : - Just like that, I'm free to go? - Just like that.
Beckett : We need to sign a few release forms, if you don't mind.
UNK: Ian Busch : I can't believe it. Thank God.
UNK: Bree Busch : Thank you so much. Does this mean you found the real killer?
Beckett : - We're about to make an arrest. - That's great.
Perlmutter : You know, what's even better is that
Castle : it was Hayley herself who led us to her killer.
UNK: Bree Busch : How'd she do that?
Castle : Her last song. The one that was playing the night she died.
Castle : It's all over the web. You know the one.
UNK: Hmm.
Castle : It's the lyrics that really get me, so many layers.
Castle : It took me a few listens to get to the bottom of them.
Beckett : Mmm-hmm. First time I heard it, I thought it was about going into rehab.
UNK: Ian Busch : It is. It's about coming from a dark place
UNK: Ian Busch : and having the courage to get on with your life.
Castle : Different dark place.
Castle : Listen, this is the part that gives it away.
UNK: Bree Busch : I don't understand.
Castle : Somebody crossed over her threshold. She didn't want him to.
Beckett : - Someone forced himself on her. - You're getting all that from a song?
Castle : Well, there's other places where it's more overt.
Castle : But if you listen to the words, analyze them, it's all there.
Castle : Father figure, betrayal, violation.
Castle : It's truly awful.
UNK: Bree Busch : Why didn't she say anything? Lan, did she ever say anything to you?
UNK: Ian Busch : No. No, she didn't.
Beckett : You told your husband about arguing with Hayley
Beckett : the night she was killed, didn't you?
UNK: Bree Busch : Yes. He was there when I got home from the studio.
