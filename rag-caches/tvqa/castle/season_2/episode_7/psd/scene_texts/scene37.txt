Castle : It means we have the wrong killer.
Beckett : The identity of her killer is in the song?
Castle : - It's right there. Listen! - I know, I already heard it.
Beckett : Don't you think that if Hayley knew who was going to kill her,
Beckett : she would've tried to prevent the murder?
Castle : It never made sense until now.
Castle : Why would she up and disappear when everything seemed to be going so well?
Castle : It's in the words. She even says it. "I can explain if you're listening."
