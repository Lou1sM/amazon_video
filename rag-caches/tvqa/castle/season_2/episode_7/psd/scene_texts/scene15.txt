Castle : when you started that sentence, didn't you?
Beckett : Okay, Mr. Mystery-Writer-Man, what's your bestselling theory?
Castle : - I'm gonna go with the butler. - The butler?
Castle : That's who we always go with when we run out of ideas.
Castle : - How about Alexis? - Oh, Alexis.
Castle : She's perfect. She's peripheral to the case,
Castle : we don't suspect her, she has no alibi...
Beckett : Okay, I'll tell you what. Why don't you go home and question her,
Beckett : and if she breaks, call me.
UNK: Hey.
Castle : If you killed someone, you would tell me, right?
UNK: Franco Marquez : Of course.
Alexis : I'd need help hiding the body.
UNK: - That's my girl. - Hi, darling.
Castle : - Did you get my text? - Yeah.
Alexis : Did you really meet the rest of The Blue Pill?
Castle : Yes, I did. And all I can say is, admire them from afar.
Castle : What are you listening to?
Martha : It's Hayley's last performance. Oy!
Castle : Yeah. Sounds pretty. Little creepy, though.
