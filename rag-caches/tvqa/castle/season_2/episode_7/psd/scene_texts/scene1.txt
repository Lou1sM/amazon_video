UNK: No wallet, no phone, no ID.
Castle : - She doesn't need ID. - You know her?
Beckett : - Are you sure it's her? - That's Hayley Blue.
Castle : I took Alexis to see her band, The Blue Pill, last year.
Castle : What happened?
Perlmutter : Well, it looks like she was killed off-site, then brought here and staged.
Beckett : Time of death?
UNK: I'd say between midnight and 3 : 00 a.m., give or take.
Beckett : - Do you guys hear that? - What?
Beckett : The song. It's playing again.
Beckett : It's on repeat.
Castle : Well, that's gotta be a message, right?
