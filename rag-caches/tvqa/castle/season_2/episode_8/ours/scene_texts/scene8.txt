Castle : And I'm only gonna say it once. 1980s Martha was pretty great,
Castle : but present-day Martha is pretty spectacular, too.
Martha : - Did you just accept that? - Yeah.
Martha : - Well, take it back. - I'm sorry, I cannot.
UNK: - Oh, God. Come... - No. But since it's done,
Castle : why don't you take a visit to Chet's page,
Castle : and see what he looks like nowadays?
Martha : Just like this? Press that?
Martha : Oh, good... Well, that's Chet, but how old is that photo?
