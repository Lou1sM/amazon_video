Montgomery : Nothing about what was in the package.
UNK: At 7 : 23 he makes this phone call to his wife.
Beckett : Brady was killed 45 minutes after those two phone calls.
UNK: Yeah, but we don't have a why or a who.
Castle : Or a how it's related to your mystery package.
Montgomery : Warden have any suspects?
Beckett : A whole prison yard full. He was shanked in the yard.
Beckett : There were no witnesses.
Beckett : Warden's less than optimistic about catching the killer.
Montgomery : - Brady have any beefs? - Apparently, he was the model prisoner.
Montgomery : Then it must've been a hit ordered from the outside.
Castle : By the same guy who killed our messenger.
Montgomery : Any luck on tracking down Brady's wife?
Esposito : Big fat zippo. But they left the apartment in a hurry.
Esposito : I pinged the cell phones, tracked the credit cards.
Esposito : - She's off the grid. - Maybe not completely.
Ryan : I just got off the phone with the son's school.
Ryan : According to the principal, Brady's kid misses class

Montgomery : Tomorrow's Tuesday. You get the doctor's name?
UNK: Let's set up on the office in the morning. We might get lucky.
Castle : What you doing, Mother? Working on your play?
Martha : Oh, I wish. I've been bombarded with friend requests.
Martha : It's like a part-time job.
Martha : And these exchanges are just ridiculous.
Martha : Dot Ellison, who I have absolutely no desire to reconnect with,
Martha : has just wasted 20 minutes of my life
