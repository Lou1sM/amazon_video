UNK: Blake Wellesley : Mother became very confused, very upset.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : I'm sure there's a better way to facilitate this.
Beckett : Like what?
UNK: Blake Wellesley : Well, I propose that all further interviews be coordinated by me
UNK: Blake Wellesley : and conducted at my offices.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : What do you think?
Montgomery : Thank you for your offer, Mr. Wellesley. It's very nice of you.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : Not at all. I'll give you my number.
Montgomery : Hold on. I, too, have a "however."
Montgomery : Thank you for your offer, however,
Montgomery : my detectives will conduct their investigation in any manner they see fit.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : Captain, I can get the commissioner on the phone in under a minute.
Montgomery : Well, tell him I said hi and I really could use a raise.
Montgomery : I think we're done here.
Castle : That was awesome.
Montgomery : Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.
Montgomery : They're circling the wagons.
UNK: Awesome!
Martha : Ignore, accept, ignore...
Martha : Accept, ignore...
Castle : Oh, Mother, come on! Accept the man's friend request, already.
Martha : Using that old photo was a horrible idea.
Martha : Why didn't you stop me?
Castle : Since when have I had the power to stop you from doing anything?
Martha : What will Chet think if he expects 1980s Martha,
UNK: and present-day Martha shows up?
Castle : You tell anyone I said this, and I'll deny it.
Castle : And I'm only gonna say it once. 1980s Martha was pretty great,
Castle : but present-day Martha is pretty spectacular, too.
