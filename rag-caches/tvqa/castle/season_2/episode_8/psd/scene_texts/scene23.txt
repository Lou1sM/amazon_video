UNK: Blake Wellesley : Mother, do you remember Olivia? Olivia Debiasse?
UNK: Lenanne Wellesley : Of course I do. I have my mind.
Beckett : - Mrs. Wellesley, we need to... - Who are you?
UNK: Lenanne Wellesley : - Blake, that's not Olivia. - Yes, Mother.

Beckett : Yes, ma'am. Uh, but before we can deal with that,
Beckett : we need to ask you a few questions about Olivia Debiasse.
UNK: Olivia.
