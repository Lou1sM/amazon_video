UNK: Nice.
UNK: Trent Wellesley : You think I'm rich because my last name's Wellesley,
UNK: Trent Wellesley : but my dad died when I was a kid.
UNK: Trent Wellesley : Mom and me had to pretty much survive off the handouts of relatives.
Castle : Oh, I suppose getting a job would be out of the question.
Beckett : Who are you protecting?
Beckett : You already admitted to arguing with her.
Castle : It really does not look good.
UNK: Trent Wellesley : You have to understand. He's like the only father I have.
Beckett : - Who are you talking about, Trent? - My Uncle Winston.
UNK: Trent Wellesley : He'd just been through a bad breakup and...
UNK: Trent Wellesley : He's the kind of person that people try to take advantage of.
Castle : People like who? Olivia? Or poor relations looking for a handout?
UNK: Trent Wellesley : I'd seen her with him before.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Yes, it's terrible what happened to that poor girl.
Beckett : Could you tell us about the kind of relationship
Beckett : you had with her, Mr. Wellesley?
Beckett : Was the reunion the first time that you two met?
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Actually, I believe I met Olivia at a cocktail party a few weeks before that.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Was it MoMA? I don't recall.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Anyway, I took a shine to her.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Charming. Ambitious.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Rough around the edges, but I felt I could mentor her.
Castle : - And by mentor, you mean... - What are you suggesting?
Beckett : Your nephew Trent said that he saw her hitting on you the whole night.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Well, that's Trent for you.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : He's always been very protective of the family.
