UNK: Winston Wellesley : - A Wellesley. - And...
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Actually, truth is, I'm Olivia's father.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : I know. I had the same look on my face when Olivia told me 10 years ago.
Castle : - And Olivia's mother didn't tell you? - Mmm-mmm. Didn't tell Olivia, either.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : I was just on the verge of telling everyone when she...
UNK: Winston Wellesley : She was tragically killed.
Beckett : It is a tragedy when a father kills his daughter, isn't it?
UNK: What?
Beckett : What do you know about Olivia's missing body?
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Nothing! That's obscene! Who would do something like that?
Castle : You. So no one would ever find out the truth of who she really was.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : I didn't kill her and I certainly didn't hide her body.
UNK: Yet, 10 years after her death, you're still trying to hide her existence.
