Beckett : Where were you between 10 : 00 p.m. And 2 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : On the night she was murdered?
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Are you seriously asking me, Winston Wellesley, for an alibi?
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Oh. Apparently, you are.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : Fine. I was home.
Beckett : - Can anyone corroborate that? - Yes. God.
Bartender : Mr. Wellesley, your car is ready.
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : As delightful as this conversation has been, I must take my leave.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : I have to meet my brother at his campaign headquarters.
Castle : Ah, yes. Blake Wellesley, running for Senate again.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Winston Wellesley : And we'd appreciate your support. Don't forget to vote.
Castle : I have no doubt he was having an affair with Olivia. But why would he kill her?
Beckett : Do you think maybe he was upset that she came with someone else?
Castle : Mmm. Jealousy. Money. Murder. Does it get any better than this?
