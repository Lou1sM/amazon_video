UNK: Winston Wellesley : Well, you have to understand, I have a family to protect.
Castle : Olivia was family.
Castle : Winston Wellesley, you did it.
Beckett : He might have, but we don't have the evidence to prove it.
Esposito : That's because he didn't. We were able to verify Winston's alibi.
UNK: - He was really home alone? - Oh, he was home, but he wasn't alone.
Ryan : Winston had some romantic company that night.
Beckett : Well, then if he had an alibi, why didn't he just say so from the start?
Esposito : Maybe because of who his romantic company was.
Ryan : Stanley Jenkins.
Castle : Is Stanley a unisex name now, or is Winston...
Ryan : - Gay? Uh, yeah, he's gay. - He lied to us. Who is he protecting?
Castle : Well, he said it himself.
UNK: Family.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : You have to understand that this young woman, Olivia, I hardly knew her.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : Maybe I shook her hand at the party, but that's all.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : And now you're telling me
UNK: Blake Wellesley : her mother and I worked at the same campaign 30 years ago?
Beckett : You and your brother were in Ithaca July and August of '78.
Beckett : Olivia was born May '79. That's nine months later.
UNK: Your brother claimed paternity, but I think we all know that's highly unlikely.
UNK: Winston, what the hell is going on here?
UNK: Blake, it's time to get the lawyers involved.
UNK: Blake Wellesley : What did you know about this, Winston?
UNK: Winston Wellesley : This is not the time or the place.
