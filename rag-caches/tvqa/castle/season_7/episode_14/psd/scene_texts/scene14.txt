Esposito : And that's even if Saint Simon's lets us have it.
Esposito : But I do have some good news for you.
UNK: What?
UNK: The DA signed-off on Castle working this case with us.
Esposito : He'll be here ready to jump in by the time you get back.
UNK: Do you really think Nieman's behind Susan Watts's murder?
Beckett : Couldn't tell. She's got ice water in her veins.
UNK: Although, I'll bet Kelly Nieman wasn't
Beckett : in the alleyway doing the dirty work.
Beckett : Last time, she had an accomplice, a proxy.
Beckett : Someone who did the killing for her.
Castle : So who's the proxy this time?
Esposito : Hey, guys. We got something.
Esposito : The hospital won't share security footage without a court order.

Esposito : So, we started rolling through it.
Esposito : And in no time, we ran across this.
Beckett : She's carrying a Kelly Nieman gift bag.
Castle : Well, that's her. That's definitely Susan Watts.
Tory : Except there's a timeline problem.

Castle : All right. Then, either by some insane coincidence
