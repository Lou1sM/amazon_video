Castle : Yeah, and we are just looking to clear his name.
UNK: Yep.
Gretchen : It's a little late for that now.
Beckett : It might help you rest easy
Beckett : knowing that some of what was said about Jerry is untrue.
Castle : All we would need is a sample of your DNA.
UNK: Then I won't do you no good. Jerry wasn't my blood.
Beckett : You're listed as his mother.
Gretchen : Not by choice. He was Jeff's kid.
Gretchen : He was a boyfriend at the time.
Gretchen : Jeff took off, and he never came back.
UNK: So what was I gonna do?
Gretchen : I tried to make this a happy home for Jerry,
UNK: and I looked after him as long as I could.
