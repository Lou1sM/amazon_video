Beckett : Jerry Tyson.
Castle : He's alive.
Gates : Listen up, people. This woman is in grave danger.
Gates : She left Saint Simon's Hospital yesterday,
Gates : and we urgently need to find her.
Beckett : She is a patient of Dr. Kelly Nieman.
Beckett : Nieman is not cooperating, so canvass the hospital.
Beckett : Someone there has to know who she is.
Gates : And work this vehicle.
Gates : We find the truck, we find the woman
UNK: along with the man she took a ride with.
Beckett : That man is Jerry Tyson, also known as 3XK.
Beckett : And I am sure that no one here is more familiar with him than Castle.
Castle : Uh, a dubious distinction.
Castle : 3XK, the Triple Killer.
Castle : So named because he kills his victims in groups of three.
Castle : Blondes, like his latest victim Susan Watts.
Castle : The original 3XK killings were unsolved
Castle : and stopped soon after they started.
Castle : But then, four years ago, another victim showed up.
Beckett : The Triple Killer is back.
Beckett : The man that we're looking for is Marcus Gates.
UNK: NYPD!
Castle : Now, we couldn't prove that Marcus Gates was 3XK.
UNK: But his cellmate, Jerry Tyson,
Castle : agreed to help us put Gates away in exchange for early release.
Castle : That turned out to be not such a good deal.
Castle : It's not Marcus Gates.
Castle : It was him all along. He's the real Triple Killer.
Castle : By the time we realized that Jerry Tyson was 3XK, it was too late.
Castle : We got close again when Tyson used the gun
Castle : he stole from Detective Ryan in a homicide.
UNK: Then he dropped out of sight. But not for long.
Esposito : Richard Castle,
Esposito : you're under arrest for the murder of Tessa Horton.
Castle : You did this. You killed Tessa.
Castle : You killed Tessa.
Tyson : You will not last the night.
Castle : He's not dead.
Beckett : You shot him. He's dead. It's over.
