Castle : We didn't even know if he was alive. But we do now.
Beckett : But we might have gotten lucky.
Beckett : It looks like Susan Watts escaped from Tyson,
Beckett : forcing him to kill her in the alley and leave her body there.
Beckett : Which means he got careless. He made mistakes.
Beckett : Let's press our advantage and find this woman
Beckett : before she becomes his next victim.
Nieman : You look well, Mr. Castle.
UNK: Though your palpebral folds could use some tending.
Nieman : I thought you stopped working on cases.
Castle : For you, I made an exception.
Nieman : Please know I'm here as a courtesy.
Beckett : I'm sure you are.
UNK: Um, who is this woman?
Beckett : And don't say you don't know her. She is carrying your swag bag.
Nieman : That doesn't prove she's a patient.
Castle : Are you saying she's not a patient?
Nieman : I'm saying I can't answer that.
Nieman : I'd be breaking confidentiality.
