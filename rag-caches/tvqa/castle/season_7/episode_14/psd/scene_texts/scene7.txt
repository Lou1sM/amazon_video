UNK: Kate, I think Susan Watts's surgery
Lanie : was performed by the same doctor.
Beckett : Dr. Kelly Nieman?
Nieman : Please, let me offer you a pen.
Beckett : No, thank you. We're just here to ask you a few questions.
Nieman : Oh, can I just say, you have an amazing face, Detective.
Lanie : I can't prove it, but my gut says this is Nieman's work.
Lanie : She was in on the murders of Pam Hodges and Daniel Santos,
Lanie : and you could never nail her for it.
Lanie : Maybe this time you can.
Lanie : Kate, are you still there?
UNK: Lanie, uh, it's not just your gut.
Beckett : Kelly Nieman is a part of this, and I'm looking right at her.
Castle : Wait. Kelly Nieman is mixed up in this?
