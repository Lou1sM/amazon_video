UNK: Nah, we haven't found him yet.
Esposito : He called 911 from a nearby payphone.
Esposito : But when we got here, he was already gone.
UNK: Obviously, she's not carrying ID.
Beckett : So, uh, I'm guessing we don't know who she is.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Hopefully, we will in a minute. In the meantime,
UNK: Lanie Parish : I can give you a pretty good idea of how she died.
Beckett : Manual strangulation.
Lanie : Probably 24 to 36 hours ago.
Lanie : Based on lividity,
Lanie : she was put in the dumpster right after she was killed.
Beckett : Abrasions on her feet, mud spatter on her legs...
Beckett : She was running. Someone was chasing her.
Esposito : Then caught her, killed her, and stuffed
Esposito : her in that dumpster over there.
Beckett : And she's wearing a nightgown. She couldn't have come from very far.
Esposito : I'll have unis show her photo around,
Esposito : try to find someone who recognizes her,
UNK: and canvass to see if there are any witnesses
Esposito : who might have seen what happened.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : Lanie, are you okay?
Lanie : Yeah, it's just something about her.
Lanie : Something familiar.
Beckett : What, like you know her?
Lanie : No, I definitely don't know her.
Lanie : If she's in the system, we can find out who she is.
Ryan : Susan Watts. Born in Vestal, New York.
UNK: High-school dropout. Multiple arrests.
UNK: Check kiting, petty larceny, busts for possession.
UNK: The last one got her sent to Albion,
UNK: but she was released six months ago.
Beckett : Anything since then?
Ryan : No, that was her last known contact with law enforcement.
Beckett : What about known associates?
Beckett : Maybe she was hanging out with someone that knows who killed her.
Ryan : No associates listed, but I do have Susan Watts's address.
Katrina : Can I help you?
Beckett : Detective Beckett, NYPD.
Beckett : I need to ask you a few questions about Susan Watts.
Katrina : Why? Did something happen?
Katrina : I quit smoking seven years ago,
