UNK: to Susan Watts's murder or Amy Barrett's disappearance.
Esposito : How much time do we have before we have to cut him loose?
Beckett : Gates is trying to stall the DA. So we got an hour, maybe two.
Ryan : Here we are, not being able to prove that Tyson is Tyson
Ryan : because we don't have his DNA sample that he stole.
UNK: Or unless, this guy is Mike Boudreau.
UNK: That could explain the fingerprints, all he's been saying.
Ryan : Which would mean what? That Tyson is actually dead?
Ryan : And Kelly Nieman cut Boudreau to look like Tyson?
Castle : No, this guy is Jerry Tyson.
UNK: I wanna talk to him. Rattle him. Get him to reveal himself.
Tory : I'm with Castle. I don't think that man is Michael Boudreau.
Castle : Based on what?
Tory : Once we ID'd Boudreau and Amy Barrett,
Tory : I started monitoring their credit card activity.
Tory : Boudreau's card was just used to make a purchase
UNK: at Cafe Julius in Midtown.
Beckett : Finding the real Michael Boudreau
Beckett : might give us just the break we need.
Beckett : Kind of a role reversal, isn't it?
Tyson : Not sure what you mean.
UNK: Oh, sure you do. It wasn't so long ago you were in here visiting me.
UNK: You got me confused for Tyson again.
Castle : You were dressed in a police uniform.
Castle : And I was in there, where you are now.
Tyson : People think it's killing that I like.
Tyson : But murder's just an act.
