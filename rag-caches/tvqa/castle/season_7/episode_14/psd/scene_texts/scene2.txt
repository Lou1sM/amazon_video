Katrina : and I really want a cigarette right now.
Beckett : Katrina, when was the last time
Beckett : you saw Susan or talked to her?
Katrina : Maybe three months ago. About the time she moved out.
Beckett : She moved out? Where'd she go?
Katrina : I don't know. She didn't stay here long. Less than six months.
Beckett : Did she have any friends? Boyfriends? People that she partied with?
Katrina : Susan wasn't like that. Not anymore.
