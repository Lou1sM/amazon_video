UNK: Kelly Nieman : Such lovely features.
UNK: Kelly Nieman : What skilled hands could do with you.
Beckett : I'm not interested in a consultation.
Nieman : Neither am I.
Nieman : You do know your little theory
Nieman : that I played a role in those deaths
Nieman : damaged my practice, my reputation.
Nieman : But I can truly say that's all in
Nieman : the past now, and I bear you no malice.
Beckett : Well, that's a relief. What can you tell me about Susan Watts?
Nieman : I'm not familiar with that name.
Beckett : She was a client at NewStart Horizons.
Nieman : Many women are.
Beckett : So, you never met her there?
UNK: I donate to NewStart Horizons, Detective,
Nieman : but it's not where I spend my time. And I don't know Susan Watts.
Beckett : Does this refresh your memory?
Beckett : She got a job that apparently doesn't exist.
Beckett : She also had cosmetic surgery performed by you.
Nieman : You must be mistaken. I never forget a face.
Nieman : Especially if I cut it.
Beckett : So, I suppose you won't mind
Beckett : if I take a look at your patient records, just to be sure?
Nieman : Of course not.
Nieman : I just need to see a court order signed by a judge.
Beckett : I'll get one.
Nieman : Not based on casual suspicions, which is all you seem to have.
Beckett : I'll be back.
Nieman : A parting gift?
Nieman : A facial rejuvenation kit. My own product line.
Beckett : No. Thank you.
Nieman : You sure? You look a bit fatigued.
Esposito : 'Sup, Beckett?
Beckett : Kelly Nieman just denied knowing Susan Watts,
Beckett : and I need proof that she is lying.
Esposito : We haven't found any yet.
Esposito : But so far, nobody at NewStart Horizons
Esposito : remembers seeing them together.
Esposito : And there's no forensic evidence
Esposito : that ties Nieman to the murder.
UNK: Put a surveillance detail on her.
Beckett : And pull security video from Saint Simon's Hospital.
