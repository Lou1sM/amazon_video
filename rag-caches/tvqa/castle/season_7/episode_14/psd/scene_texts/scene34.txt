Castle : This is all about your mother.
Beckett : I'm sorry, Ryan, I got caught in traffic.
UNK: Boudreau's probably long gone by now.
Ryan : Not necessarily.
UNK: He ordered a cobb salad at Cafe Julius, so he may be in there eating.
Beckett : Okay, I'll check. I'll call you back.
Beckett : Wait, Amy Barrett? Wait, wait, I need to talk to you.
UNK: Who are you?
Beckett : I'm Detective Beckett. Leave me alone.
Beckett : No, wait. We've been looking for you.
Amy : Yeah, Mike's lawyer told me you'd show up.
Amy : He said not to talk to you.
Beckett : Did you just use his credit card?
UNK: Mike gave me permission.
Beckett : The man that you know as Michael Boudreau is Jerry Tyson.
Beckett : He is a serial killer, and you will be his next victim.
Amy : Back off!
Beckett : That's my card, Amy. Call me.
Amy : Stay the hell away!
Ryan : - Hey. - I got it.
Castle : I know how we can nail Tyson. The key is his mother.
Beckett : What about his mom?
Castle : Tyson's birth certificate is missing.
Castle : No surprise there.
Castle : But his mother signed the papers
Castle : when she dumped him into foster care.
Castle : We compare her DNA to his, we can prove he's Jerry Tyson.
