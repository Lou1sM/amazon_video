Tyson : How do you do, ma'am.
UNK: Um, I gotta be honest, this is a big misunderstanding.
Beckett : Then why did you try to run?
Tyson : I don't know. I'm sorry. I panicked, I guess.
Tyson : Honestly, I haven't always been on the right side of the law.
Castle : You don't say.
Castle : Tell us about Amy Barrett.
Tyson : Oh, sweet girl.
Beckett : What was Amy doing at the apartment?
Tyson : She stays there with me.
Beckett : What is she, your girlfriend?
UNK: I don't wanna
Tyson : put a label on what we have.
Beckett : Where is she now?
UNK: Uh, I don't know. It's not like I keep tabs on her.
Castle : What about Susan Watts? Is she your girlfriend, too?
Tyson : No, I don't know her.
Castle : Where's Michael Boudreau?
Ryan : What do you mean?
Castle : Why are you at his apartment? Driving his truck?
Tyson : Come on. Man, I'm Michael Boudreau.
Castle : You're Michael Boudreau?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: What?
Tyson : Yeah. Who else would I be?
Beckett : Jerry Tyson.
UNK: Oh.
Tyson : I get that from time to time.
UNK: Yeah. Well, that's not surprising,
Beckett : considering you look exactly like Tyson
Beckett : and nothing like this photo of Michael Boudreau.
Beckett : So, why don't you explain that?
Tyson : Truth is, I got a little work done.
