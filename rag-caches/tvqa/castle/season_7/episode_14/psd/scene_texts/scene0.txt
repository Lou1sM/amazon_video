Beckett : And next time, I will be.
Beckett : Next time?
Castle : Are you saying that you're thinking about...
Beckett : Yeah, about it. About my job.
UNK: About whether we're ready. If there's ever a right time.
Castle : There never is. But there's never a wrong time, either.
Beckett : Except maybe now.
UNK: Really?
Beckett : Okay, we'll talk about it later.
