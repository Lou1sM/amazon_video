Tyson : Hey, what brings you here?
UNK: Ah, I just, uh, thought you might like some company.
Tyson : Sure, why not? Pull up a chair.
Tyson : What are we waiting for?
UNK: I don't know, probably just paperwork. Ah.
UNK: You ever go out to White Plains?
Tyson : Can't say that I do.
Katrina : I was, um... I was just out there.
UNK: Hmm.
Castle : I saw your childhood home.
Castle : I met Gretchen Cutler.
Nieman : I'm not familiar with that name.
Castle : You know what she said?
Castle : She said nothing she ever did
UNK: could've turned you into what you are.
Castle : Is that true?
Castle : 'Cause I get the feeling it isn't.
Castle : I get the feeling
Castle : she's the first person you ever wanted to kill.
UNK: But that would be too obvious.
Castle : Better to hunt blonde women
Castle : who look like Gretchen once did.
Castle : See, that way she'd have to see their faces on the news,
Castle : and know that you're out there killing them
UNK: because of her.
Castle : Now, you've taken it to the next level, though, haven't you?
UNK: I, uh, came across this photo of
Castle : Gretchen Cutler when she was young.
Castle : Susan Watts and Amy Barrett
Castle : look just like her. Thanks to Kelly Nieman.
Castle : She supplied you
Castle : with perfect, compliant victims.
Castle : How many were there?
Castle : Not just two.
Castle : Five? Ten?
UNK: Twenty?
Castle : After all, you don't have to hunt them anymore.
Castle : You raise them.
Castle : Like livestock.
Castle : It's you.
Tyson : Yes, it is.
UNK: If by "you,"
Tyson : you mean Mike Boudreau.
Esposito : Well, this is it, bro.
Gates : Mr. Boudreau.
Tyson : Yes, ma'am.
Ryan : How is it possible?
Gates : The DNA from the tooth wasn't a match.
Esposito : It's him. We know it's him.
UNK: Javier Esposito : Ed Turner.
Esposito : What about him?
Castle : The guy who supposedly found Susan Watts's body.
Castle : Ed Turner. That name.
UNK: It's an anagram for "returned."
Gates : Maybe that's a coincidence.
Castle : No, it's not.
Esposito : There's no coincidence with Tyson.
Castle : He's always one step ahead.
Castle : He wanted to be here and so did she.
UNK: Why?
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Oh!
Castle : It keeps going to voicemail.
UNK: You've reached the voicemail
UNK: of Detective Beckett.
UNK: Yes?
Woman : It's done.
