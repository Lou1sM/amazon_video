Beckett : So, what do you see?
Castle : Looks like he uses it for storage.
Castle : Creepy, creepy storage.
Castle : Beckett, he has the same car that Noah has.
Castle : Same color, same license plate,
Castle : same sticker, everything. That's how he did it.
Beckett : So if someone spotted him, it would lead right back to Noah.
UNK: But you're gonna need more than that to call the police.
Beckett : Look around. He may have kept trophies from his victims.
Beckett : You okay?
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : Oh, God.
UNK: Castle?
Beckett : Castle, what do you see now?
Castle : I see them.
Castle : Photos of his victims.
Castle : I see all of them.
Castle : Beckett, he's here.
Castle : He's inside.
Holtzman : How did you find me?
Castle : I've been looking for you since Hollander's Woods.
Beckett : The boy.
UNK: That was you? I should've killed you when I had the chance.
Castle : You can't win, Holtzman. We know who you are.
Holtzman : It doesn't matter.
Holtzman : You'll both be dead, and they'll never find me.
UNK: Castle!
Beckett : It's locked!
UNK: Beckett! Castle!
Beckett : Can't get in!
UNK: The danger of facing your demons
Holtzman : is that, sometimes, the demons win.
