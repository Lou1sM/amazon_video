Esposito : Registered as Jane Smith. Not her real name, I'm guessing.
Beckett : So we still don't know who she is.
Beckett : Did she have a car when she checked in?
UNK: No. Cab dropped her off.
Beckett : Which means someone took her to those woods.
Castle : How long has she been staying here?
Esposito : About two weeks.
Beckett : Espo, check the drawers.
Beckett : See if we can find anything to ID our victim.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : Photos, all of the same woman.
Castle : And look at this.
Beckett : License plate numbers. Hundreds of them.
Castle : Along with the registered address of each vehicle.
Beckett : Why would she have that?
UNK: Look at the plate numbers.
Beckett : Each one has the letters "X" and "Z" in it.
Beckett : Our victim's looking for someone specific.
Castle : Yeah. But who?
Esposito : I think I know someone we can ask.
UNK: Frank Malloy : I knew something bad would happen to Emma.
UNK: Frank Malloy : I was trying to find her, to stop her.
Beckett : Mr. Malloy, what was your daughter doing in the city?
Frank : Two months ago, a friend of hers disappeared.
Frank : Emma was trying to find her.
UNK: Wait. Was this her friend?
Frank : Yeah, Zoey Addison.
Castle : And what exactly do you mean by she "disappeared"?
Frank : Zoey had a boyfriend that was beating on her.
Frank : So she took his car and was on her way to stay with Emma,
Frank : but she never showed.
Frank : A couple days later, the cops found
Frank : the car by the side of the road
