Frank : with a busted radiator,
Frank : but no sign of Zoey.
Beckett : Did they talk to the boyfriend?
UNK: Oh, yeah, but he was two states away with an alibi.
Frank : He reported the car stolen,
Frank : so the cops just figured that Zoey was on the run
Frank : and ditched it for another ride.
Frank : But Emma knew that Zoey wouldn't do that.
Frank : Not without calling.
Frank : So Emma took a leave from her cashier's job
Frank : to try to find her, retracing her route.
UNK: Em found a waitress at a truck stop
UNK: who saw Zoey get in the back of a white sedan.
Beckett : With New York plates containing the letters "X" and "Z"?
Frank : Yeah. The waitress told Emma
Frank : it had an oval sticker in its back window that said "NYC."
Beckett : That's what she was doing in the city.
Beckett : She was trying to track the car Zoey got into.
UNK: Mr. Malloy, do these woods mean anything to you?
Beckett : Is there any reason that Emma would be in them?
Castle : Were they on Zoey's route, maybe?
Castle : Somewhere near where she disappeared?
Frank : No, Zoey was coming from Pittsburgh. The opposite direction.
Castle : And all this time, no one's heard anything from her?
Frank : Zoey didn't have family.
UNK: Hell, if it wasn't for Emma,
UNK: no one would've even known that she'd disappeared.
