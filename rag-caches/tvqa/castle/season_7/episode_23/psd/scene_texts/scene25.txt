Ryan : We have a problem.
Ryan : I just spoke with CSU.
Ryan : So far, they haven't found anything in the house or the car
Ryan : that links Noah to Emma or Zoey.
Castle : So we can't connect him to either of their murders?
Beckett : What about his mother's?
Esposito : Autopsy results indicate that she died of natural causes.
Ryan : Right now, all we have this guy on is mishandling a body.
Castle : He shot at us.
Esposito : Yeah, but he was hiding in the closet at the time.
Beckett : He can claim he didn't know we were cops. He can plead out.
Ryan : Castle, we can't even link this guy to Hollander's Woods.
Ryan : In '83, he was at a military academy, all the way in South Carolina.
Castle : It was President's Day weekend.
UNK: He could've been on vacation or just skipping school.
Esposito : Except those records are gone.
Esposito : So there's no way to prove it.
UNK: All a jury's gonna hear
UNK: is that he was 1,000 miles away from New Hampshire.
Esposito : Without evidence, we don't have a case.
Beckett : The key to this is Emma.
Beckett : We need to place his car in the area at the time she was attacked.
Beckett : Let's coordinate with Collins and set up a canvass up there.
UNK: There's got to be a place he goes,
Castle : somewhere out of the way where he puts the bodies.
Beckett : You said that he was seeing a shrink?
UNK: Trooper Collins : Yeah. A, uh, Dr. Van Holtzman.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : You know, maybe Noah said something
UNK: during his sessions that could help us.
Beckett : Where do we find Holtzman?
Castle : If Noah ends up walking,
UNK: you're gonna have to have me committed.
