Beckett : Excuse me, we need to speak with Dr. Holtzman, please.
Receptionist : Of course. Just a moment.
Beckett : Listen, if after seven years of your crazy theories
Beckett : you haven't already been committed,
Beckett : then I think you're pretty safe.
UNK: Hi, I'm Doctor Holtzman.
UNK: Dr. Van Holtzman : I understand you've been looking for me.
Beckett : Yeah, I'm Detective Beckett. This is Richard Castle.
Beckett : We need to speak with you regarding one of your patients.
Esposito : Noah Lewis? Of course.
Holtzman : Let me just finish with these prescriptions and I'll be right with you.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Beckett, I know that voice.
Castle : From that day in Hollander's Woods.
Castle : It's him. He's the killer.
UNK: Castle, that was over 30 years ago. You can't possibly...
Castle : Kate, when he spoke I could feel the knife at my throat.
Castle : I will never forget that voice as long as I live.
Holtzman : Sorry about that. Shall we talk in my office?
Holtzman : Please, have a seat.
Holtzman : I wish I could say that I was surprised to hear what Noah had done.
