Castle : Because of us.
UNK: Always.
Martha : That was a lovely speech, darling.
UNK: Oh, well, I was inspired.
UNK: Castle, who's gonna be your inspiration if Beckett becomes state senator?
Lanie : Yeah. You won't be able to follow her around anymore.
Castle : Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'll write a political thriller next.
UNK: Jenny Ryan : Ooh, I would so read that.
Alexis : Beckett, if you do run, I'll help with your campaign.
Kaufman : Thank you.
Gates : It's a pretty big step, Kate.
Gates : Have you decided what you're going to do?
Beckett : Not yet. But whatever it is, I'm looking forward to the adventure.
UNK: One thing's for sure. Things are gonna change.
Castle : Well, I know one thing that'll never change.
Castle : What we all have.
Castle : A toast. To us.
Castle : To us!
UNK: Cheers.
Beckett : It's the precinct. There's been a murder.
Beckett : - What? - Oh.
