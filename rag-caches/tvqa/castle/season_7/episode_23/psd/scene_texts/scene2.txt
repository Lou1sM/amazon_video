UNK: I was 11 years old.
UNK: Uh, my mother was touring with Pippin.
Castle : I was in New Hampshire, staying with the family of a classmate
Castle : for President's Day weekend.
Castle : Their home abutted a few hundred acres of state forest
Castle : called Hollander's Woods.
Castle : We were told never to go into the woods alone.
Beckett : Somebody told you not to, so you had to do it anyway.
Castle : I walked for hours.
Castle : I was cold, completely lost.
Castle : And that's when I saw him.
Castle : A figure, clad in black, kneeling.
Castle : And after a few moments, he left.
Castle : And that's when I saw her on the ground.
UNK: Her? A body.
Castle : The first body I ever saw.
UNK: Her throat had been slit
Castle : and those same symbols were carved
UNK: Trooper Collins : into her forehead and her cheeks.
Castle : I touched her arm.
Castle : I remember thinking how cold it was.
UNK: Van Holtzman : Tell anyone what you've seen here today,
UNK: Van Holtzman : and I'll find you and kill you.
UNK: Van Holtzman : Do you understand?
UNK: Go!
Beckett : Why do you think he let you live?
Castle : I don't know.
UNK: I waited till I got back to the city to call the police,
Castle : from a payphone. I was too scared to let them know who I was.
Beckett : And who was the girl?
Castle : That's just the thing.
Castle : They searched the woods with cadaver dogs.
Castle : They never found a body.
Beckett : So you never figured out who she was?
Castle : I checked local papers.
Castle : No one in the area had been reported missing.
