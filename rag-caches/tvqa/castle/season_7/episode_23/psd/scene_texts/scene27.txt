Holtzman : But he was very troubled.
Holtzman : We did everything we could for him, while he was in our care.
UNK: Uh, Dr. Holtzman, how long have you been treating Mr. Lewis?
Holtzman : Four years. We got him stable after his mother committed him.
UNK: But a condition of his release were
UNK: state-mandated sessions every month.
Beckett : And what did the two of you talk about?
Holtzman : Anger. Intimacy.
UNK: His animosity toward women.
Castle : You went to Dartmouth?
Holtzman : Yes, for undergrad.
UNK: Uh, when was the last time you saw Mr. Lewis?
Holtzman : A few days ago. He was quite agitated.
Holtzman : He thought someone was following him.
Holtzman : I thought he was just being paranoid. So I adjusted his meds.
Beckett : And you had no idea that he was about to do something violent?
UNK: None.
Castle : He's done this before, you know.
Castle : Abducted women, killed them in the woods.
Castle : Possibly for years.
Holtzman : How do you know?
UNK: Witnesses.
Castle : When he does it, he wears a mask.
Castle : Now, why would he do that? Wear a mask when he kills them?
Castle : I don't know.
Castle : If you had to guess.
Castle : What kind of psychosis would drive a man to do that?
UNK: Something terrible in his childhood?
Holtzman : The mind of a psychopath is not that simple.
Castle : But he kills them anyway.
Castle : So why would he need to hide his face behind this?
Holtzman : Maybe he's not hiding it.
Holtzman : Maybe this is his true face,
Holtzman : the monster he knows he really is.
Holtzman : And he wants his victims to see it and fear it before they die.
