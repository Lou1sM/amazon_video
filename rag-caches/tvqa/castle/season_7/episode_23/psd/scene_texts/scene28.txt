Holtzman : Maybe his real mask
Holtzman : is the man he has to pretend to be every day.
Castle : His voice?
Castle : I know it sounds crazy.
Ryan : Because it is. Castle, we already have a suspect.
UNK: Ah, the perfect suspect.
Castle : Because Dr. Holtzman knew intimate details about his patients,
Castle : he set Noah up to take the fall,
Castle : just in case anyone got onto the murders.
Castle : And Holtzman was in New Hampshire, at Dartmouth, in 1983.
Esposito : He's a family man. Married to his wife for 24 years.
UNK: Kids, well-respected, never been arrested.
UNK: And witnesses, they saw the victim get into Noah's car, not Holtzman's.
UNK: I can't explain that yet. But Holtzman is behind this, and...
UNK: Babe, the voice, is it possible you're misremembering?
Beckett : You've made this killer your personal boogeyman.
Beckett : You said so yourself, you wanted him to be more formidable.
Castle : You don't believe me.
Beckett : He's clean. He has no connection to this case.
Beckett : We've got nothing to go on.
Esposito : Less than nothing.
Esposito : All we have is a 30-year-old voice ID
Esposito : from a witness who was a kid at the time.
Beckett : Look, Castle, we want to solve it as much as you do.
Castle : You know what?
Castle : I expected this from these guys, just not from you.
UNK: Castle!
