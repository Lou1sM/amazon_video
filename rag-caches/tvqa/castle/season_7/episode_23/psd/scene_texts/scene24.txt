Castle : Well, whatever you decide, I will back your play.
Kaufman : Thank you.
UNK: Beckett. That matchbook lead paid off.
Esposito : The unit that we put on that bar
Esposito : spotted Noah Lewis heading inside.
Esposito : ESU just took him down.
Beckett : They found him.
Noah : Where's my mother?
Beckett : Being autopsied.
Noah : I warned her,
Noah : but she wouldn't stop running her mouth at me.
Noah : Now she doesn't say a word.
Noah : It's what she deserved.
UNK: And what about the others? Did they deserve what they got?
Castle : We know what you've done, Noah. Who you really are.
Beckett : Tell us about Emma Malloy.
Noah : I'm not good with names.
Castle : You know her.
Beckett : Where were you the night before last?
UNK: Out. Out where?
Beckett : Neighbors said your car was gone.
Noah : I took a drive.
Beckett : Did you drive to the woods?
UNK: And what about this girl? Zoey Addison?
Castle : She was seen getting into your car, Noah. Now, she's gone.
Noah : Mmm. She's pretty.
Castle : Is she dead?
Noah : I can't help you.
Castle : Where do you take them?
Castle : The others? How do you make them disappear?
Beckett : We have your car, Noah. Your house. We will find evidence.
Castle : Did Emma find evidence?
Castle : Is that why you went after her? Because she got too close?
Castle : Is that why you shot at us?
Noah : You were in my house!
Noah : Don't you see? I'm the victim here. I'm the victim.
Beckett : What's wrong?
UNK: It's just... He's been getting away with it for 30 years.
UNK: I thought he'd be more formidable.
