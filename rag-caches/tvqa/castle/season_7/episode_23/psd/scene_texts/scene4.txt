Castle : I'm driven to figure out the story
UNK: because I could never figure out that one.
Beckett : Why didn't you ever tell me this before?
Castle : I think I didn't want it to be real.
Castle : But it is real.
Castle : He's real.
Castle : He killed before, and he just tried to kill again.
Ryan : I checked with the police department near Hollander's Woods.
UNK: Their logs do show that they received a call
Ryan : in February of '83 reporting a body.
Ryan : But, after coming up empty, they assumed it was a prank.
UNK: Okay, what about the FBI database?
Ryan : There's been no other occurrences in the past 30 years
Ryan : of any assaults or murders with this MO.
Ryan : Beckett, this thing that Castle says happened, it was decades ago.
Ryan : Is he really sure about this?
Beckett : As sure as I've ever seen him. Hmm.
Beckett : So, our Jane Doe.
Beckett : Anything on that coffee shop receipt?
Ryan : Yeah, a barista there remembered seeing our victim.
Ryan : She wasn't a regular, but she'd been in
Ryan : several times in the past few days.
Beckett : Was anyone with her?
Ryan : No. She came in alone.
Ryan : She'd get her drink, take a seat
Ryan : and spend hours staring out the window.
Beckett : Okay, why don't we set up a canvass of the neighborhood?
UNK: Maybe someone there knows who she is.
Ryan : After all these years, do you really think it could be the same killer?
Beckett : We won't know until we find him.
UNK: Yo.
UNK: That keycard that we found on the victim?
UNK: It was tracked to an extended-stay motel, out in Queens.
Esposito : She paid cash for the room, didn't present an ID.
