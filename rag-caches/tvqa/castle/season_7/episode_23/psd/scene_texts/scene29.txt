Beckett : I'm sorry.
Beckett : You said it was him. I believe you.
Castle : Except you're right. There's nothing we can do.
Castle : We'd have to sit on him for years, hoping he makes a move.
UNK: This is not how this story was supposed to end.
Beckett : I was thinking,
Beckett : how did he make those victims disappear without a trace?
UNK: Well, he would have had to have taken them somewhere.
Beckett : Somewhere his family didn't know about.
UNK: He'd have to have a lair. A storage space, somewhere.
Beckett : Too many things could go wrong.
Beckett : There could be a flood, a nosy manager.
Beckett : He would have to find a place over which he had absolute control.
Beckett : So I did a property search.
