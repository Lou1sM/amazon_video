UNK: Which means our killer might have had a medical background.
Beckett : You know, there are no signs of forced entry.
Beckett : Do we know how this killer came in?
UNK: Well, we're not really sure.
UNK: But he definitely wanted Abby to know that he was here.
UNK: She was texted this photo at 10 : 33,
UNK: right around time of death.
Beckett : The killer sent this?
Ryan : Right before he murdered her.
Castle : He was watching her. Hmm.
Castle : And then he sent that to terrorize her. This was personal.
Castle : Well, so much for the warm embrace of technology.
