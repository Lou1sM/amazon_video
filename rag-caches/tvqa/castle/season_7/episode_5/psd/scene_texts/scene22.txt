Evan : I don't know if it'll work.
Esposito : Our canvass didn't turn up a single witness to the abduction.
Esposito : We're nowhere, bro. Tell me you got something.
Ryan : About to find out.
UNK: Okay, let's do this.
Castle : What happened?
Evan : System crash. We're locked out!
UNK: Well, get it back up.
UNK: We got 15 minutes before these guys are dead.
UNK: It takes 20 minutes to reboot!
Garrett : What just happened?
Castle : Whatever they were trying didn't go well.
Castle : The site just crashed.
Garrett : So there's no way to trace those feeds of Oren and Kent?
Garrett : And that timer will just keep counting down
UNK: until one of them is dead?
Castle : It's all up to Beckett now.
Beckett : Adam, just answer one question and it might save your life.
