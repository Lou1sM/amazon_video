Beckett : But you know what I don't picture, Adam? What nobody pictures?
UNK: You.
UNK: You think that you've won? You haven't.
Beckett : Everyone else has.
Adam : What do you mean, "Everyone else"?
Beckett : Everyone who ever bullied you, who ever hurt you,
Beckett : belittled you,
Beckett : who thought that you were weak and worthless and small.
Beckett : And you know what, Adam? They were right.
Adam : No, they weren't. I am not any of those things.
Beckett : You're all of them and worse.
Adam : I am what people made me.
Beckett : You were born this way. Or your mommy made you.
Beckett : But Tim Witherspoon and the rest of the kids at school?
Beckett : They didn't break you.
Beckett : You were already broken.
Beckett : They only sensed what you were and what you're about to become.
Beckett : So, you know what?
Beckett : In a way, their bullying wasn't enough.
