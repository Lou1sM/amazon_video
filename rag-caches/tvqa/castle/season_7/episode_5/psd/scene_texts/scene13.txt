Beckett : How could the killer make a copy of the key without the original?
Ryan : It turns out all you need is a picture.
Ryan : When Cam bought the Rolls, he bragged about it
Ryan : by posting a photo of the key
Ryan : that anyone could then digitize.
Ryan : So, just as the killer did,
UNK: I uploaded the photo to the printer and...
UNK: Voila.
UNK: Outstanding.
UNK: If by "outstanding" you mean "horrifying."
Beckett : The killer snapped a photo of this key
Beckett : and then made a 3D duplicate of it.
Ryan : Welcome to the future.
UNK: Still, I gotta get one of these.
Beckett : Is there any way of finding out where the killer got his?
Ryan : Well, we're checking.
UNK: But between brick-and-mortar and online stores,
UNK: we got hundreds of vendors.
Beckett : Well, this explains how he got Cam's key, but not Garrett and Abby's.
Carlos : Abby never posted photos of her keys.
Carlos : And she was careful. It's not like she left them lying around.
Esposito : Did she ever valet park her car?
Carlos : No. She didn't even drive it, except to get out of the city.
Esposito : Any of her friends have keys to her place?
UNK: No.
Esposito : She never let anybody crash there?
UNK: Actually, Abby used to rent out her apartment online
Carlos : through a travel site.
