UNK: Should've tried harder.
Castle : What happened to Lane?
UNK: Everyone has their breaking point, right?
Garrett : Quit school, withdrew from life. It ruined him.
Castle : And now he's getting revenge
Castle : by going after the popular kids on social media.
Garrett : And targeting me because I didn't protect him.
Beckett : Not just you. All of us.
Beckett : Did he have any friends?
Beckett : Was there anywhere he liked to hang out?
Garrett : No, he was a loner, computer geek.
Garrett : He didn't have any friends.
Garrett : That's pretty much all I know.
UNK: Hey. Having no luck tracking down Adam Lane.
UNK: It's like he went off the grid.
Ryan : No tax returns, no driver's license, no job.
Ryan : Except for a stint at a funeral home three years ago.
Beckett : That must be how he knows about anatomy.
Beckett : What about his parents?
Ryan : Uh, father wasn't in the picture,
Ryan : mother died about a year ago.
Esposito : Hey, get this.
Esposito : I ran down Tim Witherspoon, Lane's bully.
Esposito : Turns out he's dead. Unsolved homicide.
Esposito : He was stabbed in his apartment 10 months ago.
Castle : That's right after Lane's mother died.
UNK: Maybe it's what triggered him.
Beckett : So he murdered Witherspoon, took his revenge,
Beckett : but that wasn't enough for him.
Beckett : Where did Lane and his mom live?
Ryan : Well, the apartment was sold when she died,
Ryan : but they lived on Avenue C at East Fifth.
UNK: It's the Lower East Side.
Esposito : Ever since we released Lane's photo,
Esposito : we've had multiple tips that he'd been seen in that area.
Castle : Anti-social kid like Lane
Castle : who's never made his way in the world
UNK: is gonna stay with what's familiar.
Castle : Lower East Side's the only neighborhood he's ever known.
