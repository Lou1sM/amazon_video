UNK: He was a victim of cybercrime.
Castle : And Bill Garrett was a Cyber cop.
Castle : It can't be a coincidence that the killer targeted him.
Castle : We've been looking at people Garrett put away...
Beckett : When we should have been looking at victims of his cyber cases.
Beckett : Okay, I'll get a hold of Garrett.
Beckett : I'll have him look into his old case files.
UNK: Our killer's gotta be in there somewhere.
Castle : Still, how did he get into Garrett's shop
Castle : to plant the evidence? Or Cam's car?
Ryan : I'll tell you how. With a key. A key that he made.
Castle : A 3D printer?
UNK: Yeah. Remember the fragments that we found in the lock of Cam's Rolls-Royce?
Ryan : Well, they're PLA. It's a bioplastic used in 3D printing.
Ryan : CSU found PLA in the locks at Abby's apartment,
Ryan : as well as Garrett's shop.
