Gates : for these murders not being solved.
UNK: So, what, they wanna take me off the case?
Gates : I told them no.
Gates : I won't let our suspect sabotage this investigation
Gates : by manipulating the narrative.
Gates : So, go home, clear your head,
Gates : you get back here, and you take his ass down.
Beckett : This is why I hate social media.
Beckett : Once something is out there, you have no control.
Beckett : People can take a private moment
Beckett : and create their own context.
Beckett : I mean, we weren't even investigating the murder yet
Beckett : and they made us look like we were bad cops.
Beckett : Or worse, like we didn't care.
Castle : Come on, Beckett, it's the Internet.
UNK: No one's gonna take that picture seriously.
Beckett : 1PP did.
UNK: Look, it's gonna blow over, okay?
Castle : With millions of items being posted every minute,
Castle : this is but a blip on the Net continuum.
Beckett : You know the problem with anonymity?
UNK: There is no accountability.
Beckett : It empowers cowards to become bullies. Just like this guy.
Castle : You know what?
Castle : Most bullies started out as victims themselves.
UNK: Maybe this guy's lashing out on the Internet
Castle : because it was used against him.
