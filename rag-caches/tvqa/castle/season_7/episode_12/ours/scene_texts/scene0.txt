UNK: Martha Rodgers : Well, thank you, darling.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Martha, what do you think of Rick's PI venture?
Martha : Well, it's always been a big fantasy of his to be a private investigator.
Martha : And he says that things are picking up,
Martha : he's getting more calls at the office every day.
Beckett : Yeah, from fans wanting to meet him.
Beckett : Or people with crazy theories
Beckett : about where he disappeared to for two months.
Beckett : Or cases that aren't even worth looking into, like missing cats.
Martha : Oh. Well, that does seem a bit beneath him.
Beckett : You know, he did this
Beckett : because he was hoping that we would
Beckett : be able to work together again,
Beckett : and he thought he might have some interesting cases to solve.
Beckett : But right now, it doesn't seem like he's getting much of either.
UNK: Well, if I know my son,
UNK: then he may be sticking with it
Martha : because he's too proud to walk away.
UNK: Richard Castle : Good morning!
Martha : Well, you're in a good mood.
UNK: That's because I've retooled the Richard Castle Investigations website.
UNK: - Aha! - Now, the entire world
Castle : can have access to my savvy detective skills.
Castle : Though I will take only the most compelling cases,
Castle : rife with mystery and intrigue.
Beckett : Castle, the site looks amazing.
Castle : My clients deserve only the best.
Beckett : Oh. Speaking of clients, looks like I've got one.
Beckett : I better get going.
Castle : Me, too.
Castle : A private investigator must keep regular office hours.
Beckett : You know, my murder's in the Village, right near your office.
