UNK: Oh. Oh.
UNK: What's a dongle? What's a dongle?
Ryan : It's basically an encrypted security key.
Esposito : That unlocks what?
Ryan : When Tech plugged it in,
Ryan : it routed them to an anonymous numbered bank account in Switzerland
UNK: with a balance of $100 million.
UNK: 100 million bucks?
UNK: I should have charged way more to find that purse.
UNK: Miss Del Cordova, where were you
UNK: at 12 : 09 the night that Ana was killed?
Sofia : At home, in bed.
Beckett : And can anyone corroborate that?
UNK: No.
Beckett : So tell me,
UNK: why was Ana in possession of a security key to a Swiss bank account
UNK: containing $100 million?
Sofia : I'm not at liberty to say.
Beckett : Okay, well, here's my theory.
Beckett : Ana was involved in some kind of
Beckett : a business deal with Layla Nazif.
Beckett : Something secret, illegal, or both.
Beckett : Now, you either knew about the deal
Beckett : or you were involved in it, too.
Beckett : Feel free to jump in and correct me at any point.
Beckett : You went to Ana's place to collect the money.
Beckett : She didn't have the security key, so you killed her.
Beckett : And then you hired Castle to find it.
Sofia : Ana and I were business partners, but I did not kill her.
