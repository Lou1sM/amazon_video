Beckett : What kind of business, Sofia? Your future is on the line here.
Sofia : Ana wanted to create
Sofia : the first Latin American female-driven television network.
Sofia : It was her dream.
Beckett : A television network?
Sofia : She came to me
Sofia : because she needed someone with star-power who knew the business.
Sofia : But we had to keep everything secret.
Sofia : If anyone had found out we were trying to leave Santos Desesperados
Sofia : and the very network that created us, it would endanger the deal.
Sofia : But the pieces were almost in place.
