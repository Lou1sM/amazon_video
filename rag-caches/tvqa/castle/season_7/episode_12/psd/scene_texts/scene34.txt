Francisco : I begged her not to do it.
Francisco : But she refused to see reason.
Francisco : I never meant to kill her.
Beckett : Francisco Herrara, you're under arrest
Beckett : for the murder of Anahita Menendez.
UNK: It is terrible what Francisco did.
Sofia : But Ana's legacy will live on.
Sofia : We deposited the money in escrow
UNK: 20 minutes before the deadline.
Beckett : So you'll still be able to launch the network?
Sofia : Yes. The deal is complete.
Sofia : Layla and I agreed to co-run the company in Ana's name.
Sofia : I'm sorry I deceived you, Mr. Castle.
Castle : It comes with the job.
Sofia : And pulled a gun on you.
Castle : Which also comes with the job.
Beckett : Excuse me. I'm sorry.
UNK: Uh, Miss Del Cordova, I'm sorry to bother,
Esposito : but do you think you could sign this for my tia before you leave?
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Thank you.
UNK: What's her name?
UNK: Javier.
UNK: Okay, it's for me. I just...
Esposito : I've just been such a big fan of yours for so long.
Esposito : You're just so great in Santos Desesperados.
Beckett : Uh, you know what, Castle?
Beckett : We should probably get out of here before Gates sees you.
Castle : Right. Can I walk you home? Yeah.
Castle : Who knew a missing purse would turn into a case
Castle : rife with mystery and intrigue?
UNK: Thanks.
Beckett : Oh, all I did was refer a case. You're the one who solved it.
Beckett : So how does it feel to have your first satisfied customer?
UNK: Like I wanna satisfy another one.
Beckett : Oh, I think that can be arranged.
UNK: As the sun set on the mean streets of the naked city,
Castle : I could feel my luck was about to change.
Castle : The killer was caught, my case was closed,
Castle : and hanging on my arm was the dame of my dreams.
UNK: Are you gonna be doing that all night?
Castle : Not if it hurts my chances.
