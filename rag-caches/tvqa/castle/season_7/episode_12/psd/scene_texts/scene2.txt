UNK: Ah, on a case rife with mystery and intrigue, I hope.
UNK: Not exactly.
Castle : Though I will gain some classic gumshoe experience.
Castle : The client wants me to do a background check
Castle : on the daughter's new boyfriend.
UNK: The boyfriend is 16.
Beckett : Look, Castle, you've got nothing to prove here.
Beckett : To me or to anyone else. Now is this really what you wanna do?
Castle : Well, I'm just starting out. I mean,
UNK: I have to become established, right?
UNK: I gotta pay my dues. What do you think?
Beckett : I think that if this is what you really wanna do,
Beckett : then I'm behind you all the way.
Castle : Thanks. And once I do become established,
Castle : much like my Nikki Heat novels were inspired by you,
Castle : my new series of PI novels will be inspired by me.
Castle : I'll be my own muse.
UNK: You should've stopped at "thanks." Hmm. Right.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Old habits. Sorry. Have a good day at work, honey.
UNK: Bye-bye.
UNK: Hey. Hey.
Esposito : Castle trying to crash the crime scene again?
Beckett : No, actually he's got a case of his own. So what's the word on ours?
UNK: Oh, a sanitation worker found our victim
Esposito : hidden under some trash bags up here.
Esposito : She's Anahita Menendez.
UNK: Anahita? That's an Arabic name.
