Castle : Come on! I had him right where I wanted him.
Castle : Fine. Floor seats.
Ryan : So we looked into the Danbridge Group.
UNK: It is a front. Owned by a company controlled by Abdul Nazif.
Castle : The Saudi billionaire?
Castle : He's behind this? And Mathis works for him?
Esposito : We figure that Mathis forced Ana into the limo at the opera,
Esposito : stole her purse with the USB in it. Yes, Richard.
Castle : But Mathis said that she didn't have
Castle : the purse when she got into the car.
Castle : I think I know what happened.
Castle : As Ana was leaving the opera house,
Castle : she realized she was going to be abducted.
Castle : So before she got into the limo,
Castle : she ditched the purse outside the opera house,
Castle : where I will find it and solve my case!
Castle : See, I'm telling you where I'm going.
Beckett : You know where I'm going?
Beckett : To get a confession out of Harlan Mathis.
Ryan : Whoa, whoa, whoa.
UNK: Where you going, Floor Seats?
Esposito : Make the call.
UNK: I'll...
Mathis : I have nothing to say to you.
Beckett : Then you don't grasp the situation, Mr. Mathis.
Beckett : With all the charges you're facing, plus Anahita Menendez,
Beckett : by the time you get out of prison,
UNK: you're gonna be a senior citizen.
Beckett : Now, you were hired to abduct her, weren't you?
Beckett : Is this supposed to be loyalty to your employer?
Beckett : Because they've got none towards you.
Beckett : I spoke to Abdul Nazif's people,
Beckett : and they claim to not know you.
Beckett : So you're all alone here.
Mathis : What are you offering?
Beckett : Consideration from the DA. If you tell me what happened with Ana.
Mathis : I was hired to secure Miss Menendez.
Beckett : What were your orders?
