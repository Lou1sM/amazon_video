UNK: Mmm-hmm. Try mortifying.
Castle : Yeah, I was supposed to call her with an update.
Castle : I had no idea she'd drop by to get it in person. I'm so sorry.
Beckett : It was actually kind of funny if you think about it.
UNK: Yeah. Hmm.
Castle : So I'm forgiven?
UNK: Mmm.
Castle : Forgiven enough to ask for a favor?
UNK: Mmm...
Beckett : Maybe. Depending on what you're asking.
Castle : How would you like to trace a VIN number for me?
Beckett : Oh, my God, Castle!
Beckett : You are unbelievable.
Castle : So that's a no?
Ryan : So we may have a location on our killer, Harlan Mathis.
Beckett : How'd you pull that off?
Esposito : Well, we knew he was from out of town,
UNK: so we checked motels, hotels, short-term housing.
Ryan : Building manager in Harlem recognized him from his photo.
Ryan : He checked in two weeks ago under the name James Hyndman.
Beckett : All right, let's go.
UNK: NYPD!
UNK: NYPD!
UNK: Clear!
UNK: Clear!
Esposito : No sign of Mathis.
UNK: Hey.
Ryan : I think I may have an idea who hired him. Check it out.
Ryan : Security credentials for the Saudi Consulate.
Beckett : Layla and her father are Saudi nationals.
Beckett : That can't be a coincidence.
UNK: Well, why would they hire Mathis to kill Ana?
UNK: Well, I bet this is exciting for you.
UNK: Yeah, it's not every day that the DMV gets to help the NYPD
UNK: crack a homicide case.
