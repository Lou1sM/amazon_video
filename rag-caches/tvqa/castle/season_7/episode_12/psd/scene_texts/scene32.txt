Sofia : In my trailer, where it is private. No one else was around.
Ryan : Hey, Beckett, anything?
Beckett : Yeah, it looks like part of Sofia's story holds up.
Beckett : She was at home the night of the murder.
Ryan : Someone saw her? Mmm.
UNK: The doorman. He said she came in at 9 : 30,
UNK: and she didn't leave her apartment the whole night.
Esposito : Yo. So we searched Sofia's trailer on the set.
Esposito : You'll never guess what we found.
UNK: Detectives, what can I do for you?
Esposito : Well, you can explain this.
Francisco : It's a microphone, like the ones we use to record the actors.
Beckett : Except the actors involved didn't know that they were being recorded.
Beckett : That was hidden in Sofia's trailer.
UNK: Reprehensible.
Francisco : It's probably the tabloids again.
Francisco : Believe me, I will find the person who did this.
Esposito : Well, you won't have to look too far.
UNK: Your sound man caved.
Esposito : He admitted that you borrowed it from him last week.
Beckett : You probably suspected what Ana and Sofia were up to,
Beckett : and you knew that they talked in Sofia's trailer, so you bugged it.
UNK: That's how you knew that Ana was planning on leaving.
Esposito : And taking your biggest star with her.
