UNK: Hi. Hi.
Beckett : Not bad. So, Pam here was just telling me that she saw Ana last night
Beckett : and she witnessed something very strange.
UNK: Really? What was the strange thing you witnessed?
Pam : Well, she came in, very pleasant,
UNK: said hi, not everyone does that.
Pam : But then she went to the corner
Pam : and met with this other young woman.
Pam : Pretty, dark hair. She looked Middle Eastern, maybe.
Pam : I saw her give Ana a flash drive stick.
Beckett : You mean, like, a USB drive?
Pam : Exactly. They didn't say a word to each other,
Pam : and then Ana up and slipped that USB thing in her purse and snuck out,
Pam : like she didn't want to be seen.
Beckett : So, the woman that gave Ana the USB drive,
Beckett : did you know her, or do you know anything about her?
Pam : She looked familiar, so she may be a season ticket holder.
Beckett : I need a list of those names. Is your manager in?
Pam : I'll go find her for you.
Castle : A clandestine meeting at the opera house,
Castle : a mysterious Middle Eastern woman
Castle : passes a flash drive to the victim
Castle : hours before her death.
Castle : Perhaps our telenovela actress was actually a covert operative.
Beckett : She may very well be,
Beckett : but I don't know how that's gonna help you find her purse.
Castle : And yet find it I will!
