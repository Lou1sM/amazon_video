Castle : It's not here.
Castle : Which means either
Castle : the driver found the purse, or...
Castle : This isn't my limo!
UNK: Harlan Mathis : Give me your phone.
Mathis : You and I are going for a ride.
Mathis : What were you doing in the limo, Mr. Castle?
UNK: Well, this is gonna sound crazy,
Castle : but I was looking for a purse.
Castle : A purse?
Castle : Yeah, and it wasn't there,
Castle : so why don't I just apologize for breaking into your car,
Castle : you let me go and, well, we'll just call it even.
Mathis : Whose purse is it?
UNK: Um...
Mathis : Whose purse?
UNK: Anahita Menedez : Anahita Menendez.
Mathis : What do you know about her and me?
Castle : Nothing. Just that she left the limo without her purse, so...
Mathis : You're lying. She never had a purse when she got in.
Mathis : Who hired you? Who are you really investigating? Me?
Castle : What? Why would I investigate you?
UNK: For the same reason the police are.
Mathis : Because Ana Menendez is dead.
Castle : Which you clearly had nothing to do with, so... Whoa!
Castle : Okay, see, now that's not necessary.
Mathis : I need to know what you know.
