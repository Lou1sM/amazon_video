Mathis : That print is me checking for a pulse.
Beckett : You expect me to believe that someone else killed her? Who?
Mathis : How should I know?
Mathis : But killing her was not my assignment.
UNK: Okay, Ronny, just so we are completely clear,
Castle : you remember seeing Ana out here with the purse?
Ronnie : Yeah, that's right.
Ronnie : As the driver was escorting her into the white limo.
Castle : Okay. So it's possible she handed it off to someone,
Castle : stashed it in a bag, Enemy of the State style.
Castle : Did you notice anyone near her?
UNK: Uh, just the limo driver.
Castle : All right, well, how far from the limo was she when you last saw her?
Ronnie : Uh, she was, like, right there, just near the curb.
UNK: Perfect. Thank you, Ronny.
Castle : You are getting to be an expensive habit.
Esposito : All right.
UNK: No.
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Ronny!
Castle : I might owe you a bigger tip.
UNK: Oops.
Sofia : Where I come from, it's rude to look through a lady's purse.
UNK: Miss Del Cordova. You got here fast.
Sofia : I'm very anxious to get that clutch back, as you well know.
Castle : Even if it's a knock-off?
Castle : These diamonds are fake.
Castle : What's really going on here?
Sofia : I'm sure you're mistaken.
Sofia : Please, give me the purse and its contents.
Castle : Well, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Castle : This USB drive is a part of the murder investigation.
Sofia : I'm afraid I must insist, Mr. Castle.
