Woman : Sir, can you please leave now?
UNK: Ronny, do you happen to remember where that woman went
Castle : after she left the restroom?
Ronnie : Yes, sir. The performance ended and she exited the building.
Castle : You saw her leave?
UNK: Ah, right.
UNK: See, I was out front, helping patrons into their cars
Ronnie : when I saw her head for a white limo.
Castle : She left in a limo? Did she have the purse with her?
UNK: Yep.
Beckett : You know, that smokin' hot detective
Ronnie : was really interested in the limo, too,
Ronnie : and I told her all this earlier.
Castle : Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Ronnie : You didn't ask.
UNK: I... That's a valid point.
Castle : All right, I'm asking now.
