Sofia : An Arthur Radcliffe diamond-studded clutch.
Sofia : Was it found on her?
UNK: No.
Beckett : Are you sure?
Beckett : Yes. Ana buzzed her neighbor because she'd lost it. Why?
Beckett : She lost it?
Sofia : That purse was on loan from a boutique.
Sofia : It's due back tomorrow.
Sofia : If I don't return it, I will owe them a fortune.
UNK: Well, Miss Del Cordova, I'm sorry, I can't help you.
UNK: But if I come across it, I'll let you know.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : Actually, about that purse.
UNK: It was 11 : 00 in the morning.
Castle : My phone was quieter than a dead church mouse.
UNK: My head hurt after a night of hitting the sauce
Castle : like there was no tomorrow.
Castle : For all I knew, there was no tomorrow.
Castle : I was about to pour a smile into my coffee,
UNK: have a little of the hair of the dog that bit me, when she walked in.
UNK: Senor Castle? I am looking for a private investigator.
UNK: I was just putting this away.
Sofia : So, I haven't met many private eyes.
Sofia : I haven't met many clients. Yet.
Castle : So far. So far today. Would you have a seat, Miss...
Esposito : Del Cordova. Sofia Del Cordova.
Castle : Oh. As in Sofia Del Cordova
Castle : who worked with the late Anahita Menendez?
Sofia : Sadly, yes. That is why I am here.
UNK: Sidney Perlmutter : Detective Beckett recommended you.
Castle : She did?
Sofia : She said you are the best.
UNK: And she's absolutely right. And completely unbiased.
Castle : I knew she'd come around.
Castle : Why don't we get right to business, shall we?
Castle : Just as soon as I find a pencil.
Castle : Perfect timing. Okay.
Castle : Let's start with Anahita Menendez.
Castle : What can you tell me about her death?
Sofia : Just that she borrowed my purse for the evening.
UNK: Then she lost the purse and was killed outside her apartment.
