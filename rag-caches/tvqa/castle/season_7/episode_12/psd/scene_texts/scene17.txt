Ryan : and word is he'll pretty much do anything if the price is right,
Ryan : including wet work.
UNK: But why send a hired gun like Mathis after a telenovela star?
Beckett : Let's find Mathis and ask him about Ana's murder.
Beckett : Put out an APB and alert TSA and Homeland Security.
Ryan : If he's still in town, a guy like this won't be easy to find.
Ryan : But we'll dig in, hopefully make some headway by the morning.
Beckett : Got it.
Beckett : So, the lonely PI burning the midnight oil, huh?
Castle : Who knew finding a purse could be this exhausting?
Beckett : So, did you figure out where the white limo took Ana?
Castle : I can't even figure out whose limo it was.
UNK: The Taxi and Limo Commissions have thousands of limos registered,
Castle : but they're not broken down by color. So I'm working a Plan B.
UNK: Okay, well, you ready to get out of here?
Beckett : Call it a night?
UNK: Ooh.
Castle : What's your rush, doll?
Castle : Why don't you stick around a while,
Castle : give those stems of yours a rest?
Beckett : Could I?
Beckett : I'm all alone and this is my first time in the big, scary city.
Castle : Spare me the tall tale, precious.
Castle : A dame like you? You got an angle.
Beckett : You're pretty quick for a gumshoe.
Castle : Come on, spill the story. Time is money and I got none of either.
Beckett : All right. I'll give it to you straight.
Beckett : I'm just a girl looking for a private dick.
UNK: Whoo!
Castle : Then, your search is over, sweetheart.
UNK: Okay... Let me get this, here.
UNK: This is the double one. Yeah.
UNK: There you go, I got it. There you go.
Sofia : Mr. Castle!
UNK: Miss Del Cordova, I...
UNK: Uh...
Castle : We were not expecting you.
UNK: Obviously.
UNK: And do you know what I was expecting? An update from you.
Castle : I totally forgot. I was busy working the case.
