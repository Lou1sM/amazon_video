Castle : You do know everything I know. I know nothing.
Mathis : Convince me.
Ryan : Harlan Mathis! NYPD!
Esposito : Drop that knife! Now!
Esposito : Turn around. Show me your hands!
UNK: Castle?
Ryan : What are you doing here?
Castle : I was only trying to find Ana's purse.
Castle : How was I supposed to know that the limo she was in
Castle : was being driven by the guy that killed her?
Beckett : Castle, do you realize how lucky you are?
Castle : Extremely lucky. After all, I'm married to you.
UNK: Do not even go there.
Beckett : What if we didn't connect Harlan Mathis to the Danbridge Group?
Beckett : What if that limo didn't have LoJack?
Beckett : We would have no way of finding you.
Castle : You would if you had traced that VIN number for me.
UNK: That's not the lesson to take away here.
Beckett : Look, from now on,
Beckett : I want you to tell me where you're going and what you're doing.
UNK: Uh, see, that's not fair.
Esposito : Neither is how we saved your bacon
Esposito : and got nothing to show for it.
Ryan : I mean, what is a rescue from certain death worth these days?
Esposito : Floor seats to a few Knicks games?
Ryan : At the very least.
UNK: Guys. "Rescue from certain death"?
