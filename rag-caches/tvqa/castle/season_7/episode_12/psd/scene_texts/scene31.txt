Beckett : If what you're saying is true,
Beckett : then why did you threaten Castle at gunpoint?
Sofia : Because the money has to be in the escrow account by 5 : 00 p.m. today,
Sofia : or the deal is off. Time is running out.
Beckett : Who else knew about Ana's meeting at the opera house?
Sofia : No one. She didn't even tell me where she was going.
Sofia : She just said she was meeting Layla on the Upper West Side.
Beckett : And where did you and Ana have this conversation?
