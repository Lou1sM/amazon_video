UNK: We should put a tap and a trace on all your phones.
Tory : I'll set it up.
Castle : Captain, he's already communicating.
Castle : He's out there, sitting in Boudreau's apartment,
Castle : and he knows where she is.
Gates : And we can't touch him until we have proof.
Castle : By then she'll be dead!
Castle : Please, Captain. This is... She's my wife.
Gates : Mr. Castle, I know you're hurting, we all are.
Gates : But we have to keep our wits about us.
Gates : We have to work the evidence. It's the only way we can get her back.
UNK: Captain, the canvass at the abduction site found a witness
Esposito : who said that she saw someone matching Beckett's description.
Esposito : Said she was in a wheelchair being pushed towards a red van,
Esposito : and, uh, witness also said she appeared unconscious.
UNK: She must've been drugged.
Gates : Did they see who was with her?
UNK: No. The person pushing the wheelchair was wearing a hoodie.
Castle : What about a license plate?
UNK: No.
Gates : But that's a start.
Gates : Get teams scrubbing all street cam footage from blocks nearby.
Gates : Find that van.
UNK: We are gonna get her back.
