Ryan : If it's him, he won't be able to make a move without us knowing it.
Ryan : We'll find her.
UNK: Okay. Look all you want, Detective Esposito.
UNK: Kelly Nieman : She's not here, and I have no idea where she is.
Esposito : What about your client, Amy Barrett?
Nieman : My office gave you our information on Amy Barrett.
Nieman : I can't help it if her contact information is out of date.
UNK: Yeah, I bet you can't.
Esposito : Just like you have nothing to do with Detective Beckett's disappearance.
Nieman : You seem to think that I'm something that I'm not.
Nieman : And how could I be involved? I was with you at the time.
Ryan : I've got a unit on Boudreau's place,
UNK: and a follow car standing by.
UNK: Espo, put units on Nieman as well. Copy that.
UNK: Anything on the canvass?
Gates : We've pulled officers from the 3rd and 8th precincts to help.
Gates : If there's a witness out there, we'll find them.
UNK: How about video?
UNK: Tory Ellis : The immediate area where you found her car
UNK: Tory Ellis : didn't have any street cam or security coverage.
Esposito : Making it the perfect place for an abduction.
Tory : I have teams from four precincts pulling all video in a 10-block radius
Tory : from where Beckett was taken. It's a long shot, but...
Castle : What about Amy Barrett?
Castle : The phone call she made to Beckett, can we trace that?
Tory : We did, to a cell phone. It's no longer active.
Esposito : We've got Amy's picture out to every cop and every transit worker in the city.
UNK: Amy's not gonna be in public, not if she's working with Tyson.
Gates : And we're assuming Boudreau is Tyson.
Gates : But what if Mike Boudreau is really Mike Boudreau?
Gates : What if Nieman actually cut him to look like Tyson
Gates : just to give us someone to chase?
Gates : What if the real Jerry Tyson is still out there?
Castle : No. He's just messing with our heads.
Gates : Boudreau is Tyson.
UNK: It doesn't make any sense. Why would he let himself get arrested?
