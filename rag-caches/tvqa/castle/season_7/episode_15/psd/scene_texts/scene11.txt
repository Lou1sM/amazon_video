UNK: Tyson.
Gates : Trace. Go.
UNK: Yeah.
Gates : You know the part I liked best?
Tyson : The pain in your eyes.
Tyson : The suffering.
Tyson : And all that fear knowing that I have her.
UNK: Well, if this is about me, then take me. Take me and let her go.
Tyson : No. No, if I took you, I'd only get to kill you once.
Tyson : You see, this way, I get to kill you over and over again.
UNK: Tyson.
UNK: Tyson?
Gates : Ryan? Did you get him?
Ryan : Stand by.
UNK: Wait. Wait.
UNK: We got it! Number's coming through right now!
UNK: Where is he calling from?
Beckett : Oh, God. Castle!
Ryan : He's calling from your house.
Castle : Where's Alexis?
Alexis : Dad, what the hell?
Castle : You have your passport?
Martha : Yes, yes, yes. But Richard, Europe? I...
Castle : No buts. I need to know that you're safe.
UNK: Now, the police are gonna take you to the airport.
Castle : I have friends waiting for you on the other side.
UNK: Okay.
Alexis : Dad, please be safe.
Tory : I will. But I need you to go.
UNK: Okay. Take care, baby. Be careful.
Castle : I love you.
UNK: Okay. I... Bye.
Castle : We just heard from Tech.
Ryan : No evidence of anyone tampering with your phone.
Ryan : They think that Tyson must've figured out a way
Ryan : to spoof your number from the outside.
UNK: Inside, outside, doesn't matter.
Castle : He wants me to know he can get to me any time.
