Tyson : I told you that I'm not...
Beckett : Oh, God.
UNK: Guys!
Tory : This is from a traffic camera
Tory : two blocks away from where Beckett was taken.
UNK: It's a red van.
Tory : Heading away from the abduction area.
Ryan : You run the plate?
Tory : Belongs to a plumber in Queens.
Tory : He reported it stolen three days ago.
Esposito : That's gotta be it.
Ryan : All right. I'll run an APB.
UNK: Make sure you let Castle know too.
Ryan : Yeah. Where is Castle?
Castle : Where is she?
UNK: Get out of here.
Castle : Is she alive?
Tyson : Help! I need help! Get off me! Get off me!
Castle : Where is she?
Tyson : I told you, I don't know!
Castle : Why'd you do it, Tyson? For revenge? Because we were happy?
