Esposito : Come on, Castle. Assault with a deadly weapon?
Esposito : Do you have any idea what this does to the investigation?
Esposito : You don't think I wanted to go over there and beat the hell out of him?
Castle : And Nieman?
UNK: That's not gonna get her back.
UNK: He is pressing charges.
UNK: We're gonna have to book you.
Castle : Me? What about him?
Ryan : We don't have anything to hold him on.
UNK: You are never gonna win going straight at him.

Gates : then he wouldn't have stayed in that apartment.
Gates : We'll take care of the rest of the booking details later.
Castle : Anything on the van?
