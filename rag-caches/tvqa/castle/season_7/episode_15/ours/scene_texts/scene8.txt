Nieman : Despite the situation,
Nieman : I want you to know I admire you.
Nieman : I always have.
Nieman : There's no point in resisting, Detective.
Nieman : In fact, if you accept that, I can remove the gag.
UNK: Good.
Nieman : And please don't scream. It's tedious,
Nieman : and no one can hear you.
Nieman : Much better.
Nieman : It's a crime to cover up such a lovely face.
Beckett : Kidnapping and murder are crimes.
Beckett : You can still save yourself.
Nieman : I've already been saved.
UNK: I used to feel ashamed of who I was inside,
Nieman : the things I dreamt about doing.
Nieman : And then I met Jerry, and it was like coming home.
Nieman : So if you think that I would ever turn on him,
Nieman : you don't understand me at all.
UNK: What do you think he's gonna do when you're no longer useful to him?
Beckett : He will kill you.
Beckett : I am your only chance, Kelly. I can help you.
Nieman : And you're going to.
Amy : What are you doing?
Nieman : With all the police attention, I'll need a new face.
UNK: What?
Nieman : And I've chosen yours.
UNK: No. No. No, please. Please!
Nieman : All right, this is going back on. No.
UNK: No!
UNK: Kelly Nieman : She's not here.
Tyson : But you are.
Tyson : So glad you could join me.
Nieman : Faces fascinate me.
