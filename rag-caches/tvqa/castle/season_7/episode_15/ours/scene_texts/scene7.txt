Castle : Amy Barrett.
Ryan : You think Barrett was involved in this?
Esposito : Or she's a victim too.
UNK: So she was working with them.
Castle : Don't scream, or I will shoot you.
Castle : Where's Beckett? Is she inside the house?
Castle : Where is she?
UNK: Kelly Nieman : Not here.
UNK: Where? I don't know.
Amy : They wouldn't tell me. Not until it's over.
Amy : They sent me here to wait.
Castle : I don't believe you. Who's down there? Who's in the house?
Tyson : Just me.
Castle : You're lying. They're in there, aren't they?
UNK: No.
Amy : If you bring me back there, I'll show you.
UNK: What are you doing? Making sure you stay out of my way.
Gates : You know what I love about this car?
Castle : All the trunk space. Get in.
Amy : If I'm lying, and they are down there, they're gonna miss me soon.
Amy : They'll know you're out here. They'll kill you both.
