Tyson : I told you that I'm not...
Beckett : Oh, God.
UNK: Guys!
Tory : This is from a traffic camera
Tory : two blocks away from where Beckett was taken.
UNK: It's a red van.

Tory : He reported it stolen three days ago.
Esposito : That's gotta be it.
Ryan : All right. I'll run an APB.
UNK: Make sure you let Castle know too.
Ryan : Yeah. Where is Castle?
Castle : Where is she?
UNK: Get out of here.
Castle : Is she alive?
Tyson : Help! I need help! Get off me! Get off me!
Castle : Where is she?
Tyson : I told you, I don't know!
Castle : Why'd you do it, Tyson? For revenge? Because we were happy?
Tyson : You have got the wrong guy.
Castle : The hell I do. Where is she?
UNK: No!
Castle : You planned this, you and Nieman. But it ends tonight.
Tyson : Go to hell.
Castle : Where is she? Hey.
Tyson : Hey, hey. Hey, man. No, no, wait a minute.
Castle : Tell me where she is, Tyson, or so help me God...
Tyson : I don't know! And I'm not Tyson.
Tyson : He just wants you to think I am.
UNK: Where is she? But I didn't do this. I didn't do any of this.
Castle : Where is she?
Tyson : I'm not him.
Tyson : Doctor Nieman just made me look like him, but I'm not him.
Castle : Where is she?
Tyson : My name is Michael Boudreau. I swear. I was...
Tyson : I was born in Iowa.
Tyson : I was raised on 11725 North Genoa Street.
Tyson : My parents' names are Michael and Lauren.
Tyson : I'm not Jerry Tyson. I'm not.
Tyson : I swear.
Castle : I don't believe you.
UNK: Now, last chance.
Tyson : No, please, don't. Don't, please.
Castle : Where is she?
UNK: NYPD! Police! Drop the gun! Drop it!
UNK: Police Office 2 : Drop your weapon.
UNK: Police Office 1 : Drop it!
UNK: Police Officer 2 : You heard me. Drop the gun now!
UNK: Let's see your hands!
Esposito : Come on, Castle. Assault with a deadly weapon?
Esposito : Do you have any idea what this does to the investigation?
Esposito : You don't think I wanted to go over there and beat the hell out of him?
Castle : And Nieman?
UNK: That's not gonna get her back.
UNK: He is pressing charges.
UNK: We're gonna have to book you.
Castle : Me? What about him?
Ryan : We don't have anything to hold him on.
