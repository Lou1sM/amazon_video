UNK: You are never gonna win going straight at him.
Gates : If he thought there was any chance of that,
Gates : then he wouldn't have stayed in that apartment.
Gates : We'll take care of the rest of the booking details later.
Castle : Anything on the van?
Gates : No, not yet.
Gates : You know, when I first got here,
Gates : I couldn't figure out what Beckett saw in you.
Gates : But you know what she said?
Gates : "He sees the story.
UNK: "I see the evidence, where it leads,
UNK: "but he sees the story."
Gates : That man got inside your head, and you let him.
UNK: You wanna help her, you gotta get inside his.
Gates : What's his story?
Gates : What's his next move going to be?
Gates : Now, you figure that out, and we'll find her.
UNK: Sir. What's wrong?
Ryan : It's Boudreau. Tyson. On the way back to his apartment,
Ryan : he bolted on the subway platform and jumped onto the tracks.
Ryan : Our guys tried to follow, but they lost him.
Gates : I want Transit Authority on full alert.
Gates : Put every unit in the area on the lookout,
Gates : and get his picture on the wire.
Gates : - I want him found. - Captain!
Esposito : I just sent teams to Kelly Nieman's apartment to check on her.
Esposito : She's gone. How can she be gone?
Gates : We've been on her place the whole time.
Esposito : They found an access door to the roof open.
Esposito : She must have went out of it
Esposito : and climbed across the roof to another building.
Gates : Get an APB out on her.
Gates : Get teams down to the hospital, see if she's...
UNK: Hello?
UNK: How did it feel to be that close?
UNK: Tyson.
Gates : Trace. Go.
UNK: Yeah.
Gates : You know the part I liked best?
Tyson : The pain in your eyes.
Tyson : The suffering.
Tyson : And all that fear knowing that I have her.
UNK: Well, if this is about me, then take me. Take me and let her go.
Tyson : No. No, if I took you, I'd only get to kill you once.
Tyson : You see, this way, I get to kill you over and over again.
UNK: Tyson.
UNK: Tyson?
Gates : Ryan? Did you get him?
Ryan : Stand by.
UNK: Wait. Wait.
UNK: We got it! Number's coming through right now!
UNK: Where is he calling from?
Beckett : Oh, God. Castle!
Ryan : He's calling from your house.
Castle : Where's Alexis?
Alexis : Dad, what the hell?
Castle : You have your passport?
Martha : Yes, yes, yes. But Richard, Europe? I...
Castle : No buts. I need to know that you're safe.
UNK: Now, the police are gonna take you to the airport.
Castle : I have friends waiting for you on the other side.
UNK: Okay.
Alexis : Dad, please be safe.
Tory : I will. But I need you to go.
UNK: Okay. Take care, baby. Be careful.
Castle : I love you.
UNK: Okay. I... Bye.
Castle : We just heard from Tech.
Ryan : No evidence of anyone tampering with your phone.
Ryan : They think that Tyson must've figured out a way
Ryan : to spoof your number from the outside.
UNK: Inside, outside, doesn't matter.
Castle : He wants me to know he can get to me any time.
Ryan : I'm sorry.
Ryan : I had him the night at the motel.
UNK: If I could've found a way
Ryan : to move a little faster, react a second sooner...
Castle : It's not your fault.
Castle : It's not my fault. It's his fault.
UNK: Yo. Uniform in Queens just spotted that stolen red van off the APB.
