UNK: Clear!
UNK: Beckett?
Lanie : I was so scared.
Lanie : - Are you okay? - Yeah.
Gates : That was the stupidest, most reckless, irresponsible stunt
Gates : you've ever pulled, Mr. Castle.
Gates : Thank you.
Gates : Okay, all right. All right, all right. Okay!
UNK: There is still the matter of the assault charges.
Gates : Assault charges?
Castle : It's a long story.
Castle : But, Captain, you can't be serious.
Gates : Serial killer or no,
Gates : you threatened an unarmed man with a gun.
Gates : The DA takes that very seriously.
UNK: But, in light of your outstanding work on this case,
Gates : he's willing to drop the charges
UNK: if you agree to 1,000 hours of community service.
Gates : A thousand hours?
UNK: Yes.
Gates : As a consultant to Detective Beckett and the 12th Precinct.
Castle : I'm being un-banned?
Gates : Mr. Castle, welcome back.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: That was my mother and Alexis.
Castle : They said they're on their way home,
Castle : just as soon as they do some shopping.
Castle : I don't know how you did it.
UNK: What?
Castle : Kept it together the two months I was missing.
Castle : Two days I didn't know where you were, and it nearly killed me.
Beckett : You ever think about what happened? When you were gone?
Castle : All the time.
Beckett : Every time I close my eyes, I see her face.
Castle : I see his, too,
Castle : since that night on the bridge.
Castle : You know how I deal with it?
UNK: No.
Castle : I open my eyes and look at you.
Beckett : Thanks for coming to get me.
UNK: Always.
