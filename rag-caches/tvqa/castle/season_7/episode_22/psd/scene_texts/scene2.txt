UNK: See you, Mother.
UNK: # Is he dead? Is he dead?
UNK: # Is... #
Castle : We can stay at a hotel. That way, you don't have to listen
Castle : to her say that line over and over again.
Beckett : No, it's okay. I mean, we're gonna manage.
UNK: It's just, your mom's kind of...
Castle : Annoying? Yeah, I know. Trust me, we're getting off easy.
Castle : One time, her opening line was,
UNK: "Come on, baby, I'll make it worth your while."
Beckett : Oh, I see what you mean.
Castle : Yeah. Most awkward parent-teacher conference ever.
Beckett : Hey, Lanie.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Good morning, you two. This is...
Patrick : Sid Ross!
Becket : The creator of Saturday Night Tonight.
Castle : Yeah, not to mention all the movies he produced.
Castle : The man's a mogul.
Beckett : So, what happened?
Lanie : He was strangled with his own tie,
Lanie : and then thrown down that elevator shaft
Lanie : from the SNT Studios on the 7th floor.
Lanie : His body was on the roof of that elevator for hours
Lanie : before the panel gave way, and Sid popped out.
Castle : Like some jack-in-the-box from hell.
Beckett : Time of death?
Lanie : Based on lividity, between 11 : 00 p.m.
UNK: And 2 : 00 a.m.
Castle : Looks like Sid was burning the midnight oil.
Beckett : Let's check with security,
Beckett : see if they know if anyone else was in the building with him.
Castle : Considering where we are,
Castle : maybe one of Sid's employees killed him.
Beckett : Yeah, well, Ryan and Esposito are bringing his wife in now.
Beckett : Maybe she knows who would've done this to him.
UNK: Mrs. Ross : Everyone was scared of Sid.
UNK: Mrs. Ross : But they didn't know him like I did.
