UNK: Van Zant : So, we were good.
Beckett : That doesn't square with you shooting at him in the alley.
UNK: Van Zant : That wasn't me. I swear!
Beckett : If it wasn't you, then who was it?
UNK: Mrs. Ross : I don't know.
UNK: Mrs. Ross : Sid called me
UNK: Van Zant : and told me the paperwork for my stake in the show was ready,
UNK: Van Zant : but he wouldn't sign off unless I brought him something.
UNK: Okay, fine, I'll play along.
Beckett : What did Sid want you to bring?
UNK: Van Zant : An unregistered gun.
Beckett : Why would Sid want a gun?
Beckett : Wait, no. Let me guess, he didn't tell you.
UNK: Van Zant : It's true.
UNK: Van Zant : He just told me to meet him near that alley at 11 : 30. So I did.
