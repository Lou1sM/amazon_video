Valentine : I literally bumped into him leaving
Valentine : the building from the private entrance.
Castle : Wait. Sid was leaving the building
Castle : the night of his murder? Mmm-hmm.
Beckett : Uh, Mr. Valentine, did he mention meeting with someone?
Valentine : Please, call me Danny.
Valentine : And, no, Sid didn't say where he was going.
Valentine : But I did see something strange.
Valentine : He went into the subway on the corner.
Castle : And why was that strange, Danny?
Valentine : Well, he had an around-the-clock driver,
UNK: so why would he take mass transit?
Valentine : Unless it was a secret rendezvous.
Beckett : Well, wherever Sid went,
Beckett : he obviously didn't want anyone to know about it.
Beckett : Oh, come on, Castle!
Beckett : He was flirting with me. I can't control that.
Castle : But you were flirting right back!
Beckett : Yeah, but what was I supposed to do? He's Danny freaking Valentine!
Beckett : Espo. Hey.
UNK: You find out where Sid went on that subway ride?
Esposito : Not yet, but I spoke to Gene Vogel from Sid's company.
Esposito : The only deal that he knew about
Esposito : was one that hasn't been officially announced yet.
UNK: Apparently, Sid was gonna sell 49% of his company to an equity firm.
Castle : Could that be the deal Sid was talking about?
Esposito : Doesn't look like it.
UNK: The terms of the sale would've been settled weeks ago,
UNK: there was nothing left to negotiate.
UNK: Hey, guys, you're gonna wanna see this.
UNK: So, Sid paid for his MetroCard in cash,
UNK: but I was able to use security cams
UNK: to track him all the way to Grand Army Plaza subway station.
UNK: He got off there at 11 : 30 p.m.
Beckett : In Brooklyn? What was he doing in Brooklyn?
Ryan : You know, I wondered the same thing,
Ryan : so I checked with the 87th Precinct.
Ryan : Apparently, they responded to a 911 call in that area.
