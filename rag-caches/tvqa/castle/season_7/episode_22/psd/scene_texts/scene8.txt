Beckett : you still made some pretty serious threats against Sid,
Beckett : and hours later he ended up dead.
Mickey : Okay, you're asking my whereabouts, right?
UNK: Mmm.
Mickey : Okay, I was upstairs at the rooftop bar, getting wasted all night.
UNK: And I stumbled down to the wardrobe
Liz : and props room at about 3 : 00 a.m.
Mickey : And passed out.
Mickey : I had just woken up when you guys came in.
Mickey : Plus, I had no idea Sid was even dead,
Mickey : so how could I have had anything to do with it?
UNK: Okay.
