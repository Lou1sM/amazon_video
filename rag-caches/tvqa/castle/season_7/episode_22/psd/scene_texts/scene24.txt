UNK: Twenty minutes go by, then some dude in a mask shows up.
UNK: Van Zant : Opens the dumpster, pulls out a green duffel bag.
Beckett : And what was in the duffel bag?
UNK: Van Zant : Hell if I know.
UNK: Van Zant : But that's when Sid jumps out with the gun,
UNK: screaming, "You got what you wanted, now where is she?"
Beckett : Who is "she"?
Valentine : I have no idea.
UNK: Van Zant : But the masked man got the drop on Sid.
UNK: Van Zant : They wrestled for the gun, and then...
UNK: Van Zant : Shots go off in the air.
Beckett : You know what? If you were protecting your investment,
Beckett : then why didn't you help him out?
UNK: Van Zant : Well, Sid ran off.
UNK: Van Zant : And the guy in the mask wasn't giving chase,
UNK: Van Zant : so I figured, well, I'm on parole,
UNK: Van Zant : I need to bug out before the cops show up.
Beckett : And that's all you did?
UNK: Van Zant : I drove to Sid's building to see if I could catch him
UNK: Van Zant : and ask him what the hell he got me into!
UNK: Van Zant : But he never showed up.
