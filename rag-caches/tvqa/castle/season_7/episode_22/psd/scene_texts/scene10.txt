Valentine : Sure. Let's go to my dressing room.
Valentine : Surely you've seen some of my work.
UNK: Star Fleet? Family Practice? My, uh, car-rental commercials?
UNK: Uh...
Beckett : Yeah, well, I did catch my fair share
Beckett : of Hot Suspect reruns in college.
Valentine : I knew it! The cop watched the cop show.
Valentine : Come on, I inspired you to become a detective, didn't I?
UNK: Huh?
Beckett : Maybe a little bit.
Castle : We're investigating a murder. Right?
Ryan : Right, yeah.
UNK: Uh... So, we checked Sid's phone records,
UNK: and apparently, he called you at 9 : 03 last night.
UNK: Can you tell us why?
Valentine : Yeah, I was supposed to have drinks with Sid and his ex, Evelyn.
