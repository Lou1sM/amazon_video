Beckett : So then why don't you explain how detectives found a .38 revolver
Beckett : and a Lucha Libre mask under your bed.
UNK: Um...
UNK: Must've been an evil tooth fairy
UNK: who put it there, 'cause it wasn't me!
UNK: Please, I didn't do this.
Castle : All right, then where were you the night that Sid was murdered?
Chad : At home.
Beckett : Can anyone verify that?
UNK: No.
