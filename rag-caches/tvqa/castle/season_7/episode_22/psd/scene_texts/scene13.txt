Esposito : About what? Well, check it out.
Ryan : Officers used traffic-cam footage,
Ryan : and they caught the tail end of it.
Ryan : This is about a block away from where Sid got off the subway.
Ryan : Now, keep your eye on that alley right there.
Esposito : Were those gunshots?
Ryan : Fits with the 911 call.
UNK: It was a report of "shots fired." Now, watch what happens next.
Beckett : That's Sid.
Beckett : You guys, look at the time stamp. It's from just after midnight.
Castle : This must be the deal he was talking about.
Castle : And judging by the speed his 60-year-old legs are moving,
UNK: I would say he's in danger.
Beckett : Who's that?
UNK: Mrs. Ross : I don't know, but he's got a gun.
Ryan : And he's wearing a mask.
Castle : And, hours later, Sid gets thrown down an elevator shaft?
Castle : What the hell was Sid mixed up in?
Beckett : You guys, is it just me or does none of this make sense?
Beckett : I mean, Sid was a multi-millionaire.
Beckett : Guys like that don't make shady deals in the middle of dark alleys.
Ryan : Or if you do, you have someone else do it for you.
Esposito : Yeah, and take a look at our suspect there.
UNK: I mean, what is this? A deal gone wrong, or a failed hit?
Castle : So, uh, what are we saying here?
Castle : That the masked man followed Sid back
Castle : to the SNT building and killed him?
Esposito : Well, with a private entrance with no surveillance cameras,
Esposito : it's possible, right?
Castle : But after an apparent attempt on his life,
Castle : why would Sid just go back to the office?
Beckett : And if Sid really was in danger, why didn't he call security?
