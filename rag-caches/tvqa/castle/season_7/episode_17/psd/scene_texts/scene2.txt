Beckett : Well, I feel like maybe there's something more I should be doing.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Hey, Castles. Our victim is one Henry Graham.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Took a single GSW to the chest around midnight.
UNK: So someone must've heard the gunshot.
Beckett : Do we have a witness?
UNK: Uh, as a matter of fact, yes. That jogger right there.
Beckett : Did he see the murder?
Ryan : No. But the killer was still looking through the vic's pockets
Ryan : when he jogged up.
Castle : I'm surprised he didn't get shot, too.
Ryan : So is he. She had the drop on him and told him to run.
Ryan : Probably set a personal best.
UNK: Our killer's a "she"?
UNK: Asian female, mid-30s, well-dressed...
Castle : Doesn't fit the profile of a typical mugger.
Ryan : Neither does the stuff that she took from the vic's pockets.
Ryan : She made off with his cell phone and his keys,
