Beckett : Help me! Help me, please! Help me!
Beckett : Zhang! Step away.
Zhang : Leave us, Detective.
Beckett : Don't make me ask again.
Hicks : Say goodbye, sister, 'cause I am pressing charges.
UNK: Now arrest this crazy bitch!
Beckett : Right after I arrest you.
Hicks : For what?
Beckett : We have a video of you abducting
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Henry Graham outside of his apartment.
UNK: Abduct? We gave him a ride.
Zhang : By forcing him into your SUV?
Hicks : Come on, that was a gag.
Hicks : Okay, my boys were just messing with him.
Hicks : We do that stuff all the time. Ask Henry.
UNK: That's gonna be hard, seeing as you killed him.
