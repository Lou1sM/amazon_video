Castle : Even his boss said he was a very private guy.
Castle : So, unbeknownst to anyone,
Castle : Henry sets his eyes on an X5,
Castle : he gets the alarm codes.
Castle : But, in a fateful error,
UNK: he steals an X5 belonging to this woman, a Triad assassin.
Beckett : An assassin? Really? Again?
Castle : Come on, this time it fits.
UNK: And how does it fit?
Beckett : He steals her car and she kills him?
Beckett : Why doesn't she just put in an insurance claim and call it a day?
Castle : Ah! Because it wasn't about the car.
Castle : See, when Henry stole the vehicle,
Castle : he took something of value from the inside.
Castle : That's what the assassin was trying to retrieve from his pocket.
Beckett : And said stolen item was...
Castle : Cold fusion technology, genetically engineered super-virus,
Castle : some secret unpublished Harry Potter manuscript.
UNK: Actually, one thing that you said does make sense.
Beckett : One thing?
Becket : The X5 might have something to do with Henry's death.
Castle : You know what? I'm gonna call Auto Theft
Becket : and see if there are any reported stolen X5s recently.
Castle : From a Triad assassin.
Beckett : She's not a Triad assassin.
UNK: We don't know that.
Gladys : - This is just so terrible. - Henry was such a decent man.
Gladys : I wish all my tenants were like him.
Ryan : I'm sure you do.
Ryan : Ma'am, have you seen this woman before?
UNK: Well, I believe I have.
Esposito : Here? In this building?
Gladys : Why, yes. We passed each other in the hall.
Gladys : She was headed for Henry's unit.
Ryan : When was this?
UNK: Oh, about 10 minutes ago.
Gladys : Ten minutes ago?
UNK: Or maybe less.
Gladys : Does she have something to do with what happened to Henry?
Ryan : Ma'am, what's Henry's apartment number?
Gladys : Uh, 517.
UNK: Bedroom. Yeah.
UNK: Chief Inspector Zhang : Now hand me your backup weapon.
Esposito : Here's his backup. Drop it.
