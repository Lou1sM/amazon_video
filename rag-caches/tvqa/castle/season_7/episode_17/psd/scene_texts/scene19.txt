Castle : Your phone was.
Castle : Along with someone who bore a striking resemblance to you.
Beckett : And then, hours later, Henry ended up dead.
Beckett : Where were you at midnight last night?
Glassman : Trust me, Detective Beckett, you do not wanna go there.
UNK: Well, so much for law enforcement synergy.
UNK: He out-and-out lied about knowing Henry.
Castle : He's in this thing up to his bolo tie.
UNK: Only we don't know what this is.
UNK: You know, I'm gonna see if Captain Gates can talk to the Bureau.
Beckett : Maybe she can shake some info loose.
UNK: How about you? Do you have anything?
UNK: Uh, yeah, but I'm not quite sure what to make of it yet.
Ryan : The lab found a phenol-formaldehyde resin
UNK: at the bottom of Henry's shoes.
UNK: Formaldehyde? Like, for embalming?
Ryan : Yeah. For embalming, making circuit boards,
Ryan : treatment of fabrics, all kinds of stuff.
Ryan : They think that he must've been somewhere
Ryan : where that chemical was used right before he died.
Castle : Maybe he stepped in the formaldehyde right before he stole the X5.
Esposito : He didn't jack any X5. I checked.
Esposito : There were no X5s reported stolen.
UNK: So what was he doing with those alarm codes?
UNK: And if Henry left work at 2 : 00 p.m., showed up dead at midnight,
Beckett : he's unaccounted for for 10 hours.
Beckett : So where was he during that time?
