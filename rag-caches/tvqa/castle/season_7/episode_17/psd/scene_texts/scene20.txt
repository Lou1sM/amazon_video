Esposito : Well, he didn't own a car,
Esposito : so I'll check the activity on his Metro and credit cards.
Esposito : See if he went anywhere.
Ryan : I'll circle back with his neighbors, see if they saw him.
Beckett : Okay. Call me if you guys find anything.
UNK: Yeah. Whew.
Castle : For a second there,
UNK: I thought I was gonna get stuck doing thankless grunt work tonight.
UNK: Castle.
Esposito : We're standing right here.
UNK: Richard Castle : - What? - Oh, tonight?
Beckett : Sorry. Um, I forgot to tell you.
Beckett : I'm going out with Zhang tonight.
Beckett : You are? Mmm-hmm.
UNK: This, um... Do you think that's a good idea?
Beckett : Yeah. I mean, we're working together,
Beckett : we should get to know each other better.
Beckett : Anyway, don't wait up for me, okay?
