Hicks : Wait. Henry's dead?
Hicks : Okay, I had nothing to do with that. All I did was help him.
Beckett : Help him with what?
UNK: You don't wanna talk to me? Fine. You can talk to her.
Castle : Okay, look.
Hicks : He came to me last week needing a favor.
UNK: What kind of a favor?
Hicks : Let's just say he wanted something.
Beckett : What did he want?
UNK: Hypothetically?
Beckett : Yeah, fine. Hypothetically.
UNK: Let say, and this is just an example,
UNK: that he'd wanted half a kilo of coke.
