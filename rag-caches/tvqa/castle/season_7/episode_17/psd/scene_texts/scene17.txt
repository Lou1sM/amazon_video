Zhang : We can use that and track his name.
Beckett : Did you see that?
UNK: She might've just broken this case with a Wi-Fi sign.
Castle : Yes, yes. I'm impressed. Are you happy?
Beckett : No, Castle. She's just like me. Only better.
Zhang : So I traced all the devices that used the restaurant's Wi-Fi
Zhang : during the time Henry was there.
Zhang : Only one is owned by a man fitting our suspect's description.
Zhang : Michael Glassman.
Castle : Good, we should send a copy of this over to Suyin.
Zhang : I already did. And she positively identified him
Zhang : as the one Henry was having the argument with.
