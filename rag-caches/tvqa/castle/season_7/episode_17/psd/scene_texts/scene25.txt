Beckett : Isn't it a struggle to do it all?
Zhang : The trick is to not struggle, but to find balance.
Zhang : The moment you think it's a struggle, that's when you fall.
Beckett : You know, there's one thing that doesn't add up, though.
Ryan : I mean, given who you are, it's...
Zhang : How Henry and I know each other.
Zhang : Because we come from such different worlds?
UNK: Exactly.
Zhang : My parents worked as house staff
Zhang : for the Chinese Mission to the UN.
Zhang : I ended up in public school here in the city.
Zhang : I didn't speak much English, got bullied for it.
Zhang : Henry stood up for me.
Zhang : I couldn't stop what he became,
Zhang : but we never stopped being friends.
UNK: Somehow, the fact that you did this
Castle : makes you even more attractive.
Beckett : Yeah? Well, tell it to Zhang.
Castle : This is her target?
UNK: And she has 10 others just like it.
Castle : Oh, well, so she's a good shot. Big deal.
Beckett : She's good at everything.
Beckett : She's got an incredible career,
UNK: movie-star husband, perfect kids.
Beckett : She does it all, she has it all,
Beckett : and to top it off, she's gorgeous.
Castle : Yeah, she is.
Beckett : Wait a minute, you think she's gorgeous?
UNK: I was just agreeing with you.
Beckett : Okay, but did you think it before I said it?
UNK: No?
Beckett : Oh, my God, Castle.
Beckett : I haven't felt like this since I had pimples.
Beckett : I'm insecure.
Castle : You're not insecure.
Beckett : Wait. If I'm not insecure, then why'd you say what you just said?
UNK: Ah, okay, look. You're doing it again.
Castle : It's Patterson syndrome. I knew it was a bad idea for you to go out with her.
Beckett : No, no, Castle, I just wanted to see what made Zhang tick.
Castle : You know, how she achieved what she did,
Beckett : so maybe that could help me move forward.
