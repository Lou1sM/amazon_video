Wadlow : then I can get out of here, right?
Zhang : Not when you reached out and hired someone to murder Henry.
UNK: Murder?
Wadlow : I would never have someone killed,
UNK: Billy Hicks : especially someone I've never even seen before.
Zhang : If you don't know Henry, then why would he try to frame you?
Wadlow : I have no idea. Maybe somebody put him up to it.
Beckett : - Like who? - I don't know.
Wadlow : Maybe somebody who...
Wadlow : Somebody who doesn't like the way I do business.
Wadlow : A competitor, maybe?
Beckett : Who stands to gain by you going to prison, Mr. Wadlow?
Wadlow : A whole lot of people.
Beckett : Wadlow's in the clear for the murder.
Beckett : He was locked up at the time of the death.
Zhang : Could he have ordered Henry's execution while detained?
Beckett : He made one phone call. To his lawyer.
Beckett : And he didn't manage to get through until Henry was already dead.
UNK: Yo, Beckett. We were combing through Wadlow's business dealings
