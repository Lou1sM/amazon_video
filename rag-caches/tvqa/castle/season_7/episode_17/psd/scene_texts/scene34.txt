Zhang : Why would Henry need cocaine?
Hicks : Let's just assume, in this particular example,
Hicks : that he said he was trying to help
Hicks : a friend get out of a bad situation.
UNK: Who is the friend, and what were they gonna do with the coke?
Hicks : Maybe he didn't say and I didn't ask.
Hicks : Maybe I told him he shouldn't get back in the game.
Hicks : It's too dangerous. But he said it was just a one-time deal.
Zhang : You're lying.
Zhang : Henry would never sell drugs. Hey, hey! Zhang! Zhang!
Hicks : Maybe we're talking about different Henrys.
Hicks : Because the one in my example asked for it
Hicks : to be divided into smaller eight-balls.
Hicks : Look, Detective, Henry served me well back in the day.
Hicks : When the shipment was ready,
Hicks : I had him picked up, not abducted.
