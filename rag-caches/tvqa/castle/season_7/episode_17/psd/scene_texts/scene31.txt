Ryan : We'll start by combing street cams,
Ryan : see if we can find out where that SUV went after Henry was taken.
UNK: And I'll send a team to the crime scene to canvass the park,
Esposito : see if anyone remembers seeing that SUV.
Castle : You know, we should talk to Zhang,
Beckett : see what else she knows about Henry and Hicks.
UNK: Zhang?
Beckett : You guys, did Zhang circle back through here?
Esposito : No. She stormed off that way, didn't she?
UNK: Yeah. Oh, you don't think...
Beckett : Yeah, I do. O'Donnell's Boxing Gym.
Ryan : She's going after Hicks.
UNK: Yeah, I'll get her. She's my responsibility.
Tony : If you're looking for the Pilates studio, it's across the street.
Zhang : I'm looking for your boss there. Hicks.
UNK: Billy Hicks : Step aside, Tony. Make a lady feel welcome here.
UNK: Especially someone as lovely as this delicate flower.
Hicks : What can I do you for, Miss...
UNK: Zhang.
Zhang : I'd like to discuss a mutual friend. Henry Graham.
Hicks : Sorry, I don't know that name.
Zhang : Oh, I think you do.
UNK: You don't wanna do that. You might get hurt.
UNK: Funny. I was gonna say the same thing to him.
Hicks : Wrong move, sweetheart.
