Gates : Just that it's a federal matter.
Beckett : So I'm right.
Beckett : Hicks is being investigated by the feds.
Gates : And they don't want us screwing up their case.
Beckett : Sir, he could be our killer.
Gates : They are aware of that. They need us to wait.
Beckett : For how long?
Gates : Until indictments come down.
Zhang : And when exactly do they expect these indictments?
Zhang : Days? Weeks? Months?
Beckett : We don't know.
Beckett : But until then, we've been ordered
Beckett : to stand down from this investigation.
Zhang : What are you saying?
Zhang : That my friend is dead and I can do nothing?
Zhang : Is that what you're telling me, Detective Beckett?
Zhang : Where is the justice in that?
Beckett : She's not wrong.
Castle : Look, even though we can't approach Hicks,
Castle : we can build a case, gather evidence against him.
