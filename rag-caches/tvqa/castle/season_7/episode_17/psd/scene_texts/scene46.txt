UNK: Mei Wu : I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?
Castle : I'll say so. You lied to her.
Castle : Just like you're lying to us right now.
Beckett : We checked Henry's phone records.
Beckett : He never called the restaurant.
UNK: Mei Wu : He must have used a different phone. I did speak with him.
UNK: Yeah, of course you did. When you confronted him at the park.
UNK: Mei Wu : What park?
UNK: Your MetroCard shows that you entered the subway across the street
Beckett : during Henry's time-of-death window.
UNK: Suyin told us about your friendship.
Zhang : How you grew up together.
Zhang : How you both came here, how hard it was.
Zhang : How you both owe a debt to Mimi Tan.
Castle : But that was all about to change.
UNK: You realized Henry was gonna clear Suyin's debt
Castle : and take her away from you.
Castle : And you could not allow that to happen.
UNK: Mei Wu : Please. I did nothing wrong.
