UNK: Mimi Tan : What can I do for you?
Castle : We'd like to ask you some questions about one of your customers.
Mimi : Oh, not one of my customers, he's my number-one customer.
Mimi : Henry eats here every day.
Zhang : Not anymore.
Zhang : He was murdered.
Mimi : This is tragic.
Beckett : When Henry was here yesterday,
Beckett : did he say that anything was wrong,
Beckett : or that he was having problems with anyone?
Mimi : No, I don't think so.
UNK: Her.
Zhang : Was she working here yesterday?
UNK: Suyin? Yes.
UNK: I'll go talk to her. I'll go talk to her.
Castle : What if I just stay here and wait?
Beckett : Uh, yeah.
UNK: Suyin? Detective Beckett, NYPD. We'd like a word.
UNK: Zhu Yin : I don't want trouble.
Beckett : No, no, you're not in any trouble.
Beckett : We just need to ask you a few questions.
UNK: Zhu Yin : I know nothing. I must work now.
Beckett : She knows more than she's letting on.
Beckett : It's like she's afraid to talk to us.
Zhang : Us, or perhaps you.
UNK: Her dialect indicates that she's from the Chongqing region.
Zhang : The police corruption is rampant there.
