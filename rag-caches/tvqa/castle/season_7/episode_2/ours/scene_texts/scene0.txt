Brooke : it's what author Richard Castle is known for.
Brooke : And he's delivered yet again with two new books,
Brooke : Wild Storm and Raging Heat.
Brooke : Thank you for joining us this morning.
Castle : My pleasure.
Brooke : But perhaps the bigger mystery is the one that surrounds you.
Brooke : Your disappearance made national headlines.
Brooke : Months later, you were found in a dinghy, at sea,
UNK: yet you claimed to have no memory
Brooke : of where you'd been or how you got there.
UNK: Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, even to me,
Castle : and, uh, we're still looking for answers.
Brooke : Well, your critics seem to have some.
Brooke : It's no secret your last book, Wild Storm,
Brooke : slipped off the bestseller list.
Brooke : Isn't the most logical explanation
Brooke : that this is all a publicity stunt?
Brooke : A way to make headlines to drum up book sales?
Castle : I assure you, Brooke, it was no publicity stunt.
Castle : I would never do that to my family or my fiancee.
UNK: Speaking of your fiancee,
Brooke : you vanished just moments before your wedding.
Brooke : What do you say to fans who chalk your disappearance up to cold feet?
Castle : Well, I would say that they don't know what they're talking about.
Brooke : So, the wedding's still on?
UNK: Well, we've been through a very tough experience,
UNK: and we're still trying to make sense of everything, actually.
UNK: And I actually... I came here to talk about my books.
Brooke : And if this were one of your books, Mr. Castle,
Brooke : wouldn't you find the plot a little hard to swallow?
Brooke : I mean, amnesia, really?
Castle : Well, this isn't a novel, Brooke. This actually happened.
Castle : And no one wants the truth more than I do.
Castle : And I can prove it.
Castle : I'm offering a reward.
UNK: $250,000 to anyone who can give me verifiable proof
