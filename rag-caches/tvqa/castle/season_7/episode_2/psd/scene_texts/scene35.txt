Beckett : Or what?
Jenkins : Or you're going to find out the truth.
Jenkins : And you said you didn't want to remember.
Jenkins : We went to great lengths to make sure that you didn't.
Jenkins : But if you keep looking...
Castle : There's no way in hell I asked for this.
Castle : I'm sorry.
Jenkins : But you did.
Castle : I don't believe you.
Jenkins : Hollander's Woods, Mr. Castle.
Jenkins : That February day when you were 11 years old.
UNK: No.
Jenkins : What happened to you there.
Jenkins : The real reason you became a mystery writer.
Castle : How did you...
Castle : I never told anyone about that.
Jenkins : No. Not Beckett, not your family.
Jenkins : But you told me.
Esposito : Three weeks ago.
Jenkins : So that if this ever happened, you'd have proof.
