UNK: - Hey, sexy! - Hey, sexy! Hey, sexy!
UNK: Lanie must have changed my ringtone.
UNK: Hola, preciosa. What's up?
Lanie : Something weird.
Lanie : You know that discoloration on the victim's hands and face?
Lanie : It was caused by an industrial cleaner.
Lanie : It looks like someone scrubbed his skin with it, but after he was already dead.
Beckett : Wait, Lanie, if the killer was trying to get rid of evidence,
Beckett : why would he only scrub the hands and face?
Lanie : Don't know, but the cleaner wasn't bleach-based,
Lanie : so I still may be able to pull DNA from under the fingernails.
Lanie : I also found a receipt in the victim's pocket.
Lanie : It's from a coffee shop in Brooklyn, dated the day he disappeared.
Ryan : Williger lived in Manhattan and his office was in Midtown.
Beckett : What was he doing out in Brooklyn?
Beckett : Why don't you guys canvass the coffee shop
UNK: for anyone that saw Williger?
Beckett : I'll get a search warrant for his office
Beckett : and house first thing in the morning.
Ryan : All right.
Lanie : Come on, Kate, it's his first case back after two months.
Lanie : You didn't expect everything to be back to normal right away.
Beckett : No, Lane, it's just...
Beckett : It's just I want it to be "us" again,
Beckett : and it's like there's this shadow between us.
UNK: Look, I'm choosing to trust him,
