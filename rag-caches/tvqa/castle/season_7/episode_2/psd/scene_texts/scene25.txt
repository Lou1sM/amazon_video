Beckett : Ryan, can you look into security and street camera footage
Beckett : around Wally's warehouse the night that he disappeared?
Beckett : I want to find out where he went.
Ryan : Right. Come on, boy.
UNK: Kate!
UNK: Castle?
Alexis : A memory card?
Castle : Yeah, there were three of them, in three separate envelopes.
Castle : One for Alexis, one for my mother, and one for you.
Beckett : What's on it?
UNK: Watch.
UNK: Kate, if you're seeing this...
UNK: Well, if you're seeing this, I'm probably dead.
UNK: I want you to know I never intended to leave you.
Beckett : Not like this, not on our wedding day.
UNK: But I... It wasn't my choice.
UNK: I wish I could tell you what's going on.
