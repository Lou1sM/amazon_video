UNK: Where you going, bro?
Matt : Oh, I'm, uh... I just...
Ryan : You'll never make it. Matt?
Ryan : Matt Monroe.
Ryan : Before he joined the company, he was living over in Asia.
Ryan : In fact, that's one of the reasons Williger hired you.
Ryan : Your familiarity with local cultures.
Castle : I guess Mr. Williger wasn't aware
Beckett : that familiarity extended to their heroin trade.
Beckett : The foreman said you were behind the whole operation.
Matt : - He's lying. - Really?
Esposito : 'Cause he said that he called you,
Esposito : told you he was suspicious
Esposito : about the new janitor who'd been poking around.
Esposito : You said you'd take care of it.
Beckett : That was the same night that Mr. Williger disappeared.
Ryan : Must have been quite a surprise when you realized
Ryan : the old man was your boss.
Matt : I had nothing to do with this.
UNK: We double-checked street cams.
Ryan : This is your car three blocks from the warehouse,
Ryan : just after Wally ended his shift.
Beckett : And I bet the DNA samples that we collect
UNK: are gonna confirm what we already know.
Ryan : Matt Monroe, you're under arrest
Esposito : for the murder of Wally Williger.
Marsha : Detective, if Wally knew something was wrong,
Marsha : why did he hide it from everyone?
Beckett : He didn't know who he could trust,
Beckett : and he couldn't go to the authorities because...
Samantha : Because our company name would become synonymous
Samantha : with drug smuggling.
UNK: Beckett. Hey, it's Tory.
Tory : Is Castle with you?
Beckett : No, why?
Tory : I think he might be in Montreal.
