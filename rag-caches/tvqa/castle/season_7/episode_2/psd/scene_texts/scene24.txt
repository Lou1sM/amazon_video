Mac : and then on Monday he didn't show.
Ryan : Did anything unusual happen that day?
Mac : I don't think so.
UNK: Well, were there any problems here?
Beckett : Any reason that Mr. Williger would want to go undercover?
Mac : No. He and his team came in last month
Mac : for their quarterly inspection,
Mac : and we got a glowing report.
Ryan : Well, how about when he was here as a janitor?
Ryan : Did he do or say anything out of the ordinary?
Worker : There was that thing last week.
UNK: Uh, what thing?
Mac : One of the guards caught him in the back office after-hours
Mac : rifling through some paperwork.
Beckett : What kind of paperwork?
Mac : Manifests mostly, tracking shipments from our factories.
Mac : The guard admonished him, he apologized, everybody moved on.
Beckett : Well, we need to see those manifests.
Beckett : I talked to his wife, his colleagues.
Beckett : If any of them know what Wally was doing around his warehouse,
Beckett : they're not admitting to it.
Beckett : How about you? What'd you find?
Ryan : Aside from our country outsourcing
Ryan : all its manufacturing needs to Asia,
Ryan : everything seems to be in order.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.
Beckett : How'd it go? Struck out.
Esposito : Rover here didn't have a microchip,
Esposito : so we still don't know where he came from.
Esposito : But the vet said he's in perfect health.
Ryan : You know what I don't get? Why did he have a dog?
Ryan : I mean, was it part of his cover?
UNK: Or did it have something to do with his own dog's death?
Ryan : All right, we're missing something.
Beckett : Something that makes all of this make sense.
