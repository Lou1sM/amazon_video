UNK: Bank Manager : Here you go, Mr. Castle.
UNK: Bank Manager : Box 115. Thank you.
Castle : And may I ask you something?
Castle : Do I look familiar to you?
UNK: Bank Manager : No, I don't believe so. Have we met?
Castle : I guess not. My mistake.
Castle : Is it possible to access this box today?
UNK: Of course. George,
UNK: Bank Manager : would you please take Mr. Castle
UNK: back to the safe deposit vault?
Guard : Follow me, sir.
Guard : Which box, sir?
UNK: 38.
Alexis : If it's not the right key, we'll get caught.
UNK: Sir? Ah.
Castle : Here we are.
UNK: Well... Ooh.
Guard : Is there a problem? No!
Castle : No problem. Just a little sticky.
Guard : Are you sure you have the right box?
UNK: Positive.
Guard : I'll just check with the manager.
UNK: Wait, wait. Let's try one more time.
Castle : Just a little...
Castle : There we go. It was just a little sticky.
UNK: What do you think is inside? I don't know.
UNK: But someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure I had a key.
Beckett : You ready?
Alexis : Dad, that's your handwriting.
UNK: Yeah, I don't remember writing those.
