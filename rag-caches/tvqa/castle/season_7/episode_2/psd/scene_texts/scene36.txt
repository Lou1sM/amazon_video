Castle : I asked for this?
Jenkins : Some mysteries aren't meant to be solved.
Jenkins : It's over now.
Jenkins : Go home.
Jenkins : Live your life.
Jenkins : Forget this ever happened.
Jenkins : It's what you wanted.
Alexis : How could you go up there on your own and not even tell us?

Castle : But now...
Castle : What could I have done
Castle : that was so bad that I asked them to make me forget?
Alexis : Maybe you didn't do anything.
