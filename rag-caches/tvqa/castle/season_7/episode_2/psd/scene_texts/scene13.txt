Castle : Which is why I was found at sea. Whose ship?
UNK: It's a survey vessel.
UNK: At least that's what they claimed.
Man : But I saw weapons on board.
Man : Pretty sure it was an attack ship.
UNK: Attack?
Castle : So it was military.
UNK: It must've been.
Man : I mean, why else would they keep it on the dark side of the moon
Man : where our scientists can't see it?
Castle : Excuse me?
Man : You know, they look like us now.
Man : That's why they took you. To copy your skin.
UNK: So when you say "ship," you mean
UNK: "spaceship?"
Man : We'll be defenseless when the invasion comes.
