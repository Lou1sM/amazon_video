Esposito : At least the old man version of him did.
Beckett : Yeah, this is obviously where he came to change.
Ryan : Yeah. But to do what?
Beckett : Have CSU sweep the room.
Beckett : Let's talk to neighbors, see if they saw anything.
Alexis : That's it, the building in the photo.
Alexis : Any of it look familiar?
UNK: No.
Alexis : You really think the answer's inside?
Castle : Only one way to find out.
Alexis : Dad, where are you going?
Castle : To open box number 38.
Alexis : You can't just walk into a safe deposit room.
Alexis : You need account info, signature cards.
Alexis : We don't even know if that key came from here.
Castle : I have a plan.
UNK: Dad.
Castle : Hi there. I'm wondering if you could help me.
Castle : I'd like to rent a safe deposit box.
Beckett : So the neighbor doesn't remember any visitors
Beckett : and she never saw Young Wally,
Beckett : but Old Wally was paying her to walk and feed the dog.
Esposito : Another apartment, another dog, dressing up like this.
Esposito : What was this guy doing? I don't know.
Beckett : But whatever it was, it got him killed.
