Beckett : there is nothing that I want more

Castle : You're not ready?
Beckett : No. We're both not ready.
Beckett : We're looking for solid ground,

Beckett : and I'm here for you.
Beckett : But we need to get some distance from all of this.
Castle : We need to get back to our own lives.
Beckett : Find solid ground together.
UNK: And I promise you, I'm not going anywhere.
Beckett : We've waited this long, so let's just make it right.
Beckett : How long?
