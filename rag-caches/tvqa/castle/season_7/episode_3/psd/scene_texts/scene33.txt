Beckett : You go. Okay!
UNK: Okay, I'll get this.
Castle : Her backpack and clothes. She's wearing the suit.
Beckett : Castle, block the door.
Castle : All right.
UNK: She's not slipping past this time.
Beckett : Donna, there's nowhere to go!
UNK: Yeah, I got you now.
UNK: I so missed these mind-melds.
Castle : Two o'clock!
Castle : She's right there!
Ryan : Beckett, what would you do if you were invisible?
Beckett : I'd walk out of here without having to file this report.
UNK: Mmm. Boring.
Beckett : Yeah, I know.
Esposito : What about you, Castle?
Castle : Be a fly on the wall. See what Beckett's dad really thinks of me.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: Hmm.
Ryan : What's this?
UNK: "Time you had a proper uniform. Love, Javi."
UNK: Well.
Esposito : It's from the heart, bro.
UNK: Okay. Yeah.
Esposito : Too big?
UNK: Wanna help me try it on?
UNK: Wait... Ew, they told me it was new.
Ryan : I could really use your help.
UNK: What? Blue is my color. What's wrong with you?
UNK: Hey, yeah, no...
UNK: Just try it on.
Ryan : You don't have to be embarrassed.
UNK: It's something that we share. It's okay.
Sarkov : We'll be taking custody of that, Mr. Castle.
Castle : You know, Will thought this was too much power for any one person to have,
UNK: and after everything that's happened, I think I agree.
Castle : This kind of science is a bit of a deal with the Devil.
Castle : Be careful not to lose your soul.
