Beckett : why would they target Will?
Sarkov : Technology is the arms race of the 21st century.
Sarkov : And Will was the key to our research.
UNK: His death sets us back years.
Sarkov : Excuse me for just one moment.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : Castle, if the Chinese are behind this,

Beckett : And what do they have to do with Talmadge?
Castle : I don't think it's the Chinese.
