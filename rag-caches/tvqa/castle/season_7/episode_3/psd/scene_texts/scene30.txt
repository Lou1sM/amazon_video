Beckett : That's why Will got back in touch with Donna.
Beckett : He didn't want her. He wanted her research.
Beckett : Castle, look at Will's phone records.
Beckett : For weeks, there were phone calls going back and forth
Beckett : between the two of them. And then,
Beckett : three days before his death, right when he got that suit to function,
Beckett : there were only incoming calls from her.
Beckett : Will wasn't answering.
Castle : And right after Will was murdered, she stops calling.
