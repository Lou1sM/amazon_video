Beckett : Recruited? Wait, so then he never had a breakdown.
Sarkov : Cover story to avoid questions.
Castle : Quantum engineering? DARPA? You are researching invisibility.
Sarkov : No, Mr. Castle. Invisibility is science fiction.
Sarkov : Cloaking, however, is science.
Sarkov : I have answered your questions, now answer mine.
Sarkov : How did you find out about our technology?
Beckett : During our investigation, we encountered an unseen person...
Castle : Invisible person.
Ryan : At Will's apartment.
UNK: We believe this, whoever, was behind his murder.
UNK: And given the research that you're doing here,
Beckett : we believe the killer is connected to this facility.
Sarkov : It's impossible.
Beckett : We know what we saw.
Castle : Or didn't see.
Sarkov : No, it's impossible because we haven't gotten our technology to work.
Sarkov : But I think I know who did.
Beckett : The Chinese?
Sarkov : They've been pursuing the same technology.
Sarkov : We heard they were close to a breakthrough.
Beckett : Why would you suspect them?
Sarkov : Because a few days ago we suffered a crippling cyber-attack.
