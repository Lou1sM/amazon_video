Shepherd : He said it wasn't a joke.
Shepherd : He said his time was up.
Shepherd : That he was about to lose his soul.
UNK: Well, like I said, though, uh...
Shepherd : Stupid, right?
Beckett : Espo's got something for us at the precinct.
Castle : A guy says he's gonna lose his soul,
Castle : and then he does? How creepy is that?
UNK: The guy was hustling felons and he got himself killed.
Beckett : That's not creepy, that's probable cause.
Beckett : Anything on our vic's employer?
Ryan : Uh, yeah. I got a 1-800 number for Greenblatt Insurance,
Ryan : but they're closed until tomorrow.
UNK: Can you stop by O'Neill's bar in Brooklyn on your way home?
Beckett : Ask around about the vic? Uh...
UNK: Well, unless Jenny needs you.
Ryan : No. All good.
UNK: Espo, what have we got?
Esposito : I pulled security footage from Will's building.
Esposito : There's a security camera in the elevator area
Esposito : slightly angled towards Will's apartment.
UNK: Tory Ellis : I was able to magnify the footage.
Beckett : Great. Then we should be able to pull an image
Beckett : of our killer leaving the apartment.
UNK: We should, yeah, but watch.
Esposito : This is a minute before the 911 call.
Tory : And this is minutes later.
Esposito : The door opens and closes on its own.
Esposito : And then no one enters or exits
Beckett : the apartment until police arrive.
Esposito : And all the windows were locked from the inside.
Beckett : That's impossible.
Beckett : The killer had to get in and out somehow.
Castle : Uh, can you play that again?
Castle : There's your killer, right there. Don't you see?
Castle : Will made a deal with the Devil and the contract was up.
Castle : So it was time to pay.
