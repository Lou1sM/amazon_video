Tom : I don't know who that is.
Beckett : Mr. Talmadge, your reaction says otherwise.
Beckett : Was he your attacker?
Tom : I'm not giving a statement.
Castle : Given that Mr. Fairwick was murdered,
Castle : you might want to rethink that.
UNK: Murdered?
Tom : Look, if you're implying that I had something to do with it...
Beckett : Well, why else would you refuse to answer the question?
Tom : Because you won't believe me anyway.
Tom : It'll sound crazy.
Castle : You wouldn't believe the crazy things we've heard.
Castle : Try us.
