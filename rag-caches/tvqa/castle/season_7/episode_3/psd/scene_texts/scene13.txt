UNK: Okay, fine. I admit, it is weird.
UNK: But I can tell you this.
UNK: Whatever Talmadge saw, or didn't see, it wasn't the Devil.
UNK: You're right. It was probably one of his minions.
Castle : A lowly demon that Will summoned from Beelzebub
Castle : to help him get whatever it was he wanted from Talmadge.
Beckett : Demons don't need help getting past security systems,
Beckett : and the Devil doesn't need to use the door.
UNK: I'm gonna take another look at that security cam footage
Esposito : from Will's apartment.
Beckett : Where's the DVD?
Officer : What DVD?
Beckett : I put a DVD of security footage
Beckett : in this evidence box. Where is it?
Officer : If it ain't in there, you didn't put it in there.
