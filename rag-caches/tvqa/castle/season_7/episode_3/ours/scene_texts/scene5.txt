Beckett : Yeah, well, whatever it...
UNK: That... Whatever it was,
Beckett : it just ran off with the only lead we have.
UNK: No. He ran off with my credit card.
Castle : I managed to hang onto the key card.
Castle : You don't think he's still here, do you?
Castle : You were attacked at a closed crime scene?
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : By whom?
Beckett : We didn't get a good look at the assailant, sir.
Castle : Actually, we...
Gates : Yes, Mr. Castle?
Castle : It was dark, and we didn't see anything.
UNK: Do you know why this person was there?
Beckett : We believe they were after the victim's key card.
Gates : Why? Were they trying to gain access to some part of Will's life?
Castle : Or maybe they were covering their tracks
Castle : and don't want us to know what door that card opens.
Beckett : I've got CSU reprocessing the crime scene.
Beckett : They're looking for new prints,
UNK: and Tory is going to try to match the key card to, um, a security system.
UNK: She's gonna start that first thing in the morning.
Castle : All right. Uh, keep me posted.
Gates : Is there something you're not telling me?
Beckett : No, sir.
Castle : Detective Beckett! Lying to your superior?
Beckett : I told her the truth.
Beckett : I don't know what attacked us.
Beckett : That was not a lie.
UNK: Omission is the invisible lie.
Beckett : Castle, you can't tell me that what happened
Beckett : didn't freak you out just a little bit.
Beckett : I mean, what the hell was that thing? I don't know.
UNK: But I do know a way to take our minds off it for a while, if you're...
UNK: Interested?
Castle : You have no idea how much I've missed this.
Beckett : You had amnesia for two months. I missed it more.
UNK: Did you hear that?
Beckett : Very funny, Castle.
Castle : I'm serious.
Beckett : No. Just hear the music.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : Is that your hand on my leg?
UNK: Uh...
UNK: Yeah. No, pretty sure.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : What's wrong?
Beckett : I feel like we're being watched.
Castle : Pretty sure we're not being watched.
Beckett : You know what? Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
Castle : Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
UNK: Whoa!
UNK: Just wait here.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : And you thought zombie apocalypse survival camp was a waste of time.
UNK: Okay. Good. Okay.
UNK: What?
Beckett : You just kind of make nerdy sexy.
Castle : That's true. Where were we?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Mother!
UNK: Oh. Martha!
Martha : I'm so sorry! I didn't know you guys were home!
Martha : I just wanted a little dental floss, and it looks like I found it!
Martha : Oh, my Lord! Well.
UNK: Thank you. I...
Ryan : So, CSU reprocessed that crime scene.
Ryan : No new fingerprints, which means...
Beckett : Come on. Invisible Man?
Ryan : I'm just saying, even Beckett seemed freaked out last night.
