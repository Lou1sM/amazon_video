Debbie : Well, we didn't pull out all the luggage,
Debbie : 'cause there was no sign anyone was down here.
Castle : There's a snake on the mother-flying plane.
Debbie : You're lucky it wasn't the pit bulls we had to ship last week.
Castle : Look at this luggage.
Castle : Since when does the airline allow clothes hanging out of bags?
Debbie : They don't. Not usually.
Castle : That's three different bags from three different passengers.
Castle : That doesn't make any sense.
UNK: Unless... Unless what?
Castle : Unless someone took the clothes out of another suitcase
Castle : and stuffed them into those three bags.
Debbie : You don't think...
Castle : One way to find out.
Debbie : Oh, my God.
Debbie : That's Air Marshal Ford.
UNK: You gotta be kidding me. The air marshal is dead?
UNK: Not just dead, but bonked on the head. Murdered. And there's more.
Castle : There's more?
Castle : Kyle Ford's holster is empty. His gun is missing.
Beckett : Okay, so, uh, we have to assume that the killer is armed.
UNK: And they may have another agenda,
UNK: taking hostages, hijacking the plane...
UNK: FYI, this is not the relaxing London getaway I had planned.
