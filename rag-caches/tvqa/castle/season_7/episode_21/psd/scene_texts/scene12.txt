Marilyn : like he wasn't telling me the whole story.
Castle : So you decided to stalk him, follow him onto this plane.
Marilyn : We met in the air, fell in love on the long haul.

Castle : And when it all went south, you killed him in a rage?
Marilyn : No. I wouldn't do that.
UNK: Please. You have to believe me.
