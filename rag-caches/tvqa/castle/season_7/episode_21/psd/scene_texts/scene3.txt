UNK: Castle, I'm gonna be here with you.
UNK: I'll be working this case from the ground along with the boys.
Castle : Okay, thank you. I can figure this out.
Beckett : I know you can.
Debbie : I am sorry, miss, this area is off-limits.
UNK: Oh, she's... That's... She's with me.
Castle : That's my daughter. Yeah, she's...
Alexis : You were gone so long, I got worried. Why are you down here?
Castle : Uh, I'll call you later. I love you.
Beckett : I love you, too.
Ryan : Always rooting for that coyote, not that Road Runner...
Castle : - Right. - You guys,
Beckett : I need your help.
Alexis : Who do you think could've done it?
Castle : Well, that's what I'm gonna try to figure out.
UNK: How?
Castle : By reconstructing Ford's movements with the flight crew.
Castle : In the meantime, I need you to keep this to yourself
Castle : and go back upstairs where it's safer.
Alexis : How is it safer? Isn't that where the killer is?
UNK: I... Look, I just don't want you to be a part of this.
UNK: I'm already part of it. I can help, Dad.
Alexis : I interned with Lanie, remember?
Alexis : I'll check the body for clues.
UNK: Well, Alexis...
Alexis : There's a killer on this plane.
Alexis : We don't know what he's planning or who he is,
Alexis : and maybe I can do something about that.
