Beckett : I want him here, now.
Castle : All right.
UNK: Victor Dietrich : I am sorry, detectives, but I've never seen him before.
Beckett : Then why was $10,000 transferred
Beckett : from your bank account to his, Mr. Dietrich?
Dietrich : Must be some kind of banking error.
Beckett : No, it's not. Both of your financial institutions confirmed it.
Dietrich : It isn't a crime to give a gift.
Beckett : Oh, so it's a gift now? To someone that you don't even know?
Ryan : What were you paying the air marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?
Dietrich : This has been delightful, but I'm afraid I have to go.
Ryan : Um, no. You're not going anywhere.
Dietrich : You have no cause to hold me.
Beckett : Actually, we do.
Beckett : As a material witness.
Dietrich : A witness to what?
Beckett : The murder of a federal air marshal on a transatlantic flight.
UNK: Murder?
UNK: Air Marshal Ford is dead?
UNK: Yes. Now, what was the money for?
UNK: Security.
Castle : What kind of security?
Dietrich : I consult with Brampton's Auction House.
Dietrich : I hired Mr. Ford to provide protection
Dietrich : for a piece we acquired from the Met
UNK: that was being transported on that plane.
Beckett : What kind of a piece?
UNK: It is an Art Deco-era Louis Callay Celestialis watch,
Dietrich : worth $13.3 million.
Ryan : And Ford was carrying it?
Dietrich : He was merely keeping an eye on it.
Dietrich : One of our in-house apprentices
Dietrich : is actually wearing the timepiece.
Ryan : You gave an apprentice a $13-million watch?
Beckett : Yeah, it's a common auction house practice.
Beckett : They fly an employee to a foreign country
Beckett : wearing the goods so that they don't have to claim it or pay taxes on it.
