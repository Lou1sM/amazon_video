UNK: Ma'am, you don't want that to set.
Debbie : Come back with me and we'll take care of it.

Farrah : We obviously had a situation, but we have it under control.
Castle : I'm telling you, this is some kind of mistake.
Marilyn : That gun is not mine.
Castle : What was your plan, Marilyn?
Castle : Take hostages? Try to bring down the plane?
Castle : Bring down the plane? What the hell are you talking about?
Castle : I'm talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic.
Castle : And the threatening texts you sent from this phone.
Marilyn : That is not my phone.
Castle : It was in your purse. Paid for with your credit card.
Marilyn : Where's Kyle?
UNK: I wanna talk to Kyle.
Marilyn : I know he's the air marshal on this flight.
Marilyn : Did he put you up to this? Because it is not funny.
Alexis : How is it that you know Mr. Ford?
Marilyn : He's my boyfriend, all right?
Marilyn : And if he thinks he's teaching me a lesson,
Beckett : I'm going to be seriously pissed.
Marilyn : Now, where is he?
Castle : Marilyn, Kyle is dead.
UNK: Dead?
Marilyn : Kyle's dead? How?
Castle : You should know.
Castle : His gun was in your purse.
Castle : No, I...
UNK: I... I don't understand what's going on.
Marilyn : Someone else must have put that in my bag with the phone
Marilyn : when I was in the bathroom.
