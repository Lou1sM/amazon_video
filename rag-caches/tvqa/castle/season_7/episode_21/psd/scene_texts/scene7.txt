UNK: It's in here.
Alexis : Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?
UNK: Closest I came was a 90-year-old who had a heart attack.
UNK: Luckily, that one had a happy ending.
Alexis : This one will, too.
UNK: Yeah. How long have you been doing this?
Debbie : Thirty years. Thought I'd seen it all.
Debbie : Every crazy passenger, every country... Now this.
Alexis : If anyone can figure it out, my dad can.
UNK: Hmm. Good thing he's on this flight.
Debbie : You're lucky to have family like that.
Alexis : Yeah. I guess I am.
Alexis : What about you? You have kids?
Debbie : Ah, what can I say? It was always up in the air.
Debbie : Got it. Isadore Baldon. This is his bag.
Castle : Now, I'm not a cop, and I'm not an air marshal.
UNK: But I'm gonna find out what you're up to.
Castle : Do you know why?
Castle : Because my daughter is on this plane,
Castle : and I'm not going to let anything happen to her.
