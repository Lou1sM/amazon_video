Castle : Why not just walk into the store and buy it?
Castle : And why use a credit card that can be traced back to her? Unless...
UNK: Unless it was part of the plan,
Castle : to give us the perfect suspect so we'd stop looking for the truth.
Alexis : You think someone set her up?
Castle : I think something else is going on here.
Beckett : Look, Castle, you've been through a lot up there,
Beckett : so maybe your storyteller's imagination's getting the best of you.
Castle : I'm telling you, there's a lot more going on here.
Castle : Someone wants us to think this is over, but it's not.
Ryan : Castle may be right.
Beckett : We contacted the Air Marshal Service.
Farrah : Ford wasn't filling in for anyone.
Esposito : He requested to be on that flight.
UNK: We also double-checked Ford's financial records
Ryan : and we found a transaction that just posted.
UNK: It turns out $9,950 was wired to his bank account
Ryan : just minutes before take-off.
UNK: Just under the $10,000 mark. Someone didn't wanna tip off the feds.
Esposito : Whatever's going on up there, Ford is involved.
Castle : Who's the money from?
UNK: This guy. Victor Kristoph Dietrich.
Ryan : He's a wealthy German industrialist.
Ryan : Big name in the import-export business.
Ryan : US Customs officials had flagged him several times
Ryan : for violations, but nothing ever stuck.
Alexis : Do you think Ford requested to be on this flight
Alexis : because Dietrich paid him to be on it?
Castle : Yes. But why?
Beckett : Where is Dietrich?
Esposito : His office is two blocks away.
