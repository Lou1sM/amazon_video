UNK: Oh.
Esposito : See that? Sure did.
Esposito : The next flicker is go time. You clear on the plan?
Aragon : Don't worry about me.
Aragon : I can feel vibrations. They're on the train.
Jared : You pull your people back now or everybody dies.
Jared : Now! I know they're here.
Jared : Don't screw with me, Bob,
Jared : or I will pull my hand off this trigger right now.
Jared : How am I supposed to trust they're gone, huh?
Jared : You just tried to send storm troopers
Jared : into a subway car full of people,
Jared : not knowing where they are, or where I am...
Jared : Wait a second.
Aragon : Don't worry. He's gonna be okay.
Lanie : I know. I know.
Castle : How is she?
Beckett : Well, at least when she could see Javi, she knew he was okay.
Castle : We'll get Espo back.
Castle : The key is finding out who Stone was working with.
Beckett : The answer's probably in that White Knight directory.
Beckett : But so far, Tech hasn't been able to recover any of the data.
Castle : Well, then we'll revisit the victim.
Castle : Looking into Paul Reeves' investigations is what led us to Stone.
Castle : Perhaps it'll lead us to the others as well.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Tory, let me ask you something.
Lanie : The video from the subway. Before it cut out, did you record it?
Tory : Of course. All streaming video is archived automatically. Why?
Lanie : Could you show it to me? There's something I'd like to see.
UNK: These are all 20 of the case files Paul Reeves was working on.
UNK: Here is just a summary of those cases.
UNK: I figured we just go through these until something points to Stone,
Castle : or to Erin Wilson, or anything else we're dealing with here.
Beckett : Okay, I'll start.
