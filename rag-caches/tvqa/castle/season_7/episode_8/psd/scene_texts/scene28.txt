Castle : without explaining who she was. Stone is stalling.
Castle : He's playing for time.
Castle : Something else is going on here, something big.
Lanie : Kate, I need to show you something.
Lanie : I noticed something when I was watching earlier,
Lanie : so I went to watch this whole video.
Lanie : We have a problem. A new problem.
Lanie : This is Stone, back when he was just holding them all hostage.
Lanie : This is him later. And later.
Castle : His asthma's getting worse.
Lanie : It's not just his asthma.
Lanie : It looks like he has fever and chills.
Lanie : It's only a matter of time before he's not able to think clearly.
Lanie : The man is sick, and he's getting sicker with flu-like symptoms.
Lanie : Flu-like symptoms? Castle, that case.
Beckett : Paul Reeves was investigating a missing flu virus.
Beckett : This is all connected somehow.
Beckett : It has to be.
Jared : Once I hear that she's in international airspace, I'll surrender.
Jared : Because I'm giving you my word.
Esposito : Stone's not looking too good.
Jared : Hey, exactly how long is that gonna take, huh?
UNK: If he passes out and releases that switch, we're all dead.
UNK: We gotta make a move.
Aragon : Same plan as before?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: When?
Esposito : He gets distracted when he puffs on his inhaler. Next puff, we go.
