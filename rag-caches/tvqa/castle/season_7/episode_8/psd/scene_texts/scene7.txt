UNK: determined to stay latched onto the federal teat,
UNK: lures Paul into a meeting in the park,
UNK: where he has an assassin silence him.
UNK: Thus Paul's findings never come to light.
Beckett : And I don't suppose that you have a particular case
Beckett : of Paul's in mind, do you?
Beckett : Or proof? Or suspects?
Castle : No. But I will, once you identify who met Paul at the park.
UNK: I might be a step closer to that.
UNK: Do you remember how Paul's brother mentioned
UNK: that a "meeting" had just come up?
UNK: Well, I looked into Paul's phone calls for the last 48 hours.
UNK: One of them stood out.
UNK: An incoming call to his office at 11 : 04 yesterday morning.
UNK: Call lasted less than a minute.
UNK: And I traced it to a pay phone on the Lower East Side.
Beckett : Try and find out who made that call.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: This is street cam video of that pay phone.
UNK: 11 : 04 yesterday morning, this is the man who called Paul Reeves.
Ryan : Tory ran the image. It got a match on his face.
UNK: "Jared Stone. Misdemeanor Computer Trespassing"?
Tory : Otherwise known as hacking.
