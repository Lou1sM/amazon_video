Castle : Paul Reeves was investigating the lab
Beckett : where a sample of H5N1 went missing.
Castle : We think he figured out that Stone had stolen the virus,
Castle : which is why Stone lured him into the park and killed him.
Beckett : But, sir, there are still questions.
Beckett : Like who Stone was working with.
Beckett : And why he did this in the first place.
UNK: So, we need to go talk to him.
Gates : Well, you better hurry up, because I hear he's not in good shape.
