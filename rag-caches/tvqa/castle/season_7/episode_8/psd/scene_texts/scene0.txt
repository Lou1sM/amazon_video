UNK: Richard Castle : So what do you think?
UNK: Richard Castle : This feels different, doesn't it? What does?
Castle : Rolling up to a crime scene as a married couple.
Castle : We're like Nick and Nora Charles.
UNK: No, like McMillan & Wife.
Castle : Hart to Hart. Turner & Hooch.
Beckett : Turner and Hooch aren't even married.
Beckett : Yeah, but you still remind me a little of Hooch.
UNK: So, uh, Morning Blend?
Beckett : Did this just happen?
UNK: Yeah, jogger found him about an hour ago.
Lanie : Which is about the time he died.
UNK: Needless to say, pretty obvious what killed him.
Lanie : Gunshot wound to the head.
Javieresposito : Him being Paul Reeves out of Queens.
Javieresposito : We're running down next of kin.
Beckett : - Anyone hear the shot? - No.
Ryan : And there's no video coverage in this area of the park.
Esposito : Killer probably knew that.
Esposito : Took Reeves' phone,
Esposito : cash from his wallet, and probably waltzed right out of here.
Esposito : Looks like a mugging gone wrong.
Castle : Well, there's no signs of struggle.
Castle : If this was a mugging and he didn't put up a fight,
Castle : why risk shooting him, especially in broad daylight?
