Jared : Look, those are my conditions. Once I hear from Erin that she's free,
UNK: I swear, I'll let everybody go.
Jared : Don't worry, everyone, it's almost over.
Jared : Stop! Please!
Esposito : Secure the switch.
Jared : I'm not done yet! I'm not done yet!
Esposito : Go, go, go, go.
Esposito : Good job.
Ryan : Hey, Javi.
UNK: So, we took down Stone.
Esposito : Nobody's hurt, everybody's fine. It's over.
Ryan : It's not over, man.
Esposito : What? What do you mean, "It's not over"?
UNK: I don't want a ticker-tape parade or anything like that,

Ryan : The CDC turned up a lethal variant of the H5N1 virus in Stone's apartment.
