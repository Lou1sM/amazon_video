UNK: Who's Lenny? Or is it Lanie?
UNK: How do you know about her?
UNK: On my last tour, an IED blew out my eardrum.
UNK: Got pretty good at reading lips.
UNK: You were saying her name before you took down Stone.
UNK: Yeah, I don't... I don't remember that.
UNK: Who you think of in that moment, it has weight.
UNK: Don't trade what's real for something that isn't.
