UNK: I'll see you around, Javi.
UNK: Well, it's not every day you come across someone
UNK: who makes a suicide bomber look like a good guy.
UNK: So, I talked to the hospital. Jared Stone will make a full recovery.
UNK: Though, clearly, his troubles aren't over yet.
UNK: Yeah, unless he goes to the same prison as Erin Wilson.
UNK: Because, in the end, Jared Stone was driven
UNK: by the most primal of emotions.
UNK: Love.
UNK: Except he could have picked a better way to express it.
UNK: Hey! Look who's here.
Esposito : What's up?
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hail the conquering hero!
UNK: Man, you had me scared.
UNK: That's because you're a wimp.
UNK: No. Well, okay.
UNK: Yeah, well, I guess that makes me a wimp, too.
UNK: Oh. Got any of that left over for me?
UNK: Javi, I was worried sick. I thought...
UNK: I know what you thought. But I'm here. I'm back. I'm all right.
UNK: I hate to interrupt, but I have a brilliant idea.
UNK: How about we all go to The Old Haunt, huh? Drinks on me.
UNK: Yeah, done. Come on, we'll take the subway.
UNK: Too soon? Too soon.
UNK: Please accept this as a token of my apology.
UNK: Am I on the wrong track here?
