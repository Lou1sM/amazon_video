Gates : They should be on the scene right now.
UNK: Captain Bigalow : Detective Ryan? Yes, sir.
UNK: Captain Bigelow, HRT. What's the intel on your suspect?
UNK: Sir, he's a hacker, an Occupy Wall Street activist. It's all sketchy.
Bigalow : What about your boy, Esposito? Is he someone we can count on?
Bigalow : He's solid? He's as solid as they get.
Bigalow : Roger that.
Ryan : Hey, Beckett, I'm sorry.
UNK: Kevin, no one could've seen this coming.
UNK: No, I mean, he's my partner.
UNK: I should never have let him go in there alone.
UNK: We got to focus on getting Javi out of there.
Beckett : So, once you brief HRT, just head over to Stone's apartment.
Ryan : Leave the scene?
Beckett : There's nothing that you can do that HRT isn't already doing.
UNK: And if we wanna help Javi out,
Beckett : then the best thing that we can do
Beckett : is find out who Jared Stone is and why he is doing this.
Beckett : And some of those answers might be at his apartment.
Ryan : Okay. I'll check it out and let you know.
Lanie : Kate! Is it true? What they're saying?
Beckett : Listen, he has been in worse scrapes than this,
UNK: and we are gonna get him out of there, I promise you.
UNK: Detective Beckett? Dr. Parish? We've got eyes on Esposito.
UNK: Where is this coming from?
Beckett : I didn't think the MTA had cameras in the subway cars.
Tory : They don't. The train is part of a pilot program for video security.
Tory : This is on a separate feed, so it took me a while to find it.
Beckett : Wait, if this is on a separate feed...
Castle : That means that we can see Stone, but he doesn't know that.
Gates : Which gives us a tactical edge.
Gates : I'll make sure HRT knows about this.
Lanie : At least Javi's not down there alone. There's another cop with him.
Beckett : Yeah, between the two of them,
Beckett : they might be able to diffuse the situation.
Aragon : Kind of a weird time for him to be hitting his playlist.
