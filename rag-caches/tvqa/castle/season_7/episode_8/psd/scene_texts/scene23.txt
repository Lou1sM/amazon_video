UNK: You gonna eat that thing or just gaze at it in wonder?
Beckett : I don't understand.
UNK: Why does HRT wanna breach?
Gates : In their assessment, Stone is trapped with no good options
Gates : and no way to carry out his original plan.
Gates : They believe the longer this goes,
Gates : the more likely he will do the unthinkable.
UNK: But why not see how things play out with Erin Wilson?
Gates : HRT thinks the Erin Wilson demand is a ruse.
Gates : Stone is playing this card to buy time, work up his nerve.
Lanie : If they bust in, what'll keep Stone from blowing that vest?
Gates : Esposito will. He's in on it.
Castle : Won't Stone see HRT coming?
Tory : Yes, if they approach via the tunnel.
Tory : But they're dropping onto the train from above.
Tory : Through the subway grates.
UNK: When? Soon.
Gates : Any moment now.
Aragon : You sure we shouldn't tell the others?
UNK: No.
Esposito : They'll get nervous, and Stone will pick up on it.
UNK: Hey, why'd you become a cop?
Aragon : Got out of the army. It's what made the most sense.
Esposito : Me, too.
