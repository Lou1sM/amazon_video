Ryan : Stone was an Occupy Wall Street activist who hacked into a major bank,
Ryan : releasing their e-mails, which reflected poorly on their business practices.
Beckett : So, why would a hacker like Jared Stone kill a GAO investigator?
UNK: He wouldn't.
UNK: That story doesn't make any sense, but this one does.
UNK: Using his vaunted hacking skills,
UNK: Jared Stone is the one who uncovered the nefarious scandal.
Beckett : So, we're back to a nefarious scandal? Yes.
Castle : See, he wants to blow the lid off the scandal,
Castle : so who better to call than intrepid investigator Paul Reeves?
Castle : Because, wait for it,
Castle : Jared Stone is a whistleblower.
Castle : And Paul Reeves was murdered because of what Jared Stone told him.
UNK: Which... Which actually means he could be in danger now.
Ryan : You have to admit, Castle's theory is surprisingly logical.
Beckett : Yes, and it's conveniently unburdened by evidence.
Beckett : Nevertheless, let's bring Jared Stone in for questioning,
UNK: and let's take a look at the video footage of that pay phone
Beckett : for the past two weeks. If Jared Stone talked to anyone,
UNK: I wanna know who it was.
Esposito : Yo. I may have an address on Jared Stone.
Esposito : I ran his e-mails. He rented a place on the Lower West off craigslist.
UNK: Go. Yeah.
UNK: Okay.
Esposito : So what's going on with married life, huh?
Esposito : How is that, the whole family thing?
UNK: Sarah Grace, she's growing up, changing so fast.
