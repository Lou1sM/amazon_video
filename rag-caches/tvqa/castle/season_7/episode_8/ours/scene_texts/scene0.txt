UNK: Richard Castle : So what do you think?
UNK: Richard Castle : This feels different, doesn't it? What does?
Castle : Rolling up to a crime scene as a married couple.
Castle : We're like Nick and Nora Charles.
UNK: No, like McMillan & Wife.
Castle : Hart to Hart. Turner & Hooch.
Beckett : Turner and Hooch aren't even married.
Beckett : Yeah, but you still remind me a little of Hooch.
UNK: So, uh, Morning Blend?
Beckett : Did this just happen?
UNK: Yeah, jogger found him about an hour ago.
Lanie : Which is about the time he died.
UNK: Needless to say, pretty obvious what killed him.
