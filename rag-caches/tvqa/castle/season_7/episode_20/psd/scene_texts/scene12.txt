Ryan : How do you plan on doing that?
Castle : The military skull tattoo I told you about. That could help ID him, right?
Esposito : We'll see what we can find out.
Esposito : But it's a long shot.
Esposito : At best.
Castle : I know this seems impossible.
Beckett : A lot of our cases do at first.
UNK: But there's something there, Castle.
Beckett : So, we'll just follow it and see where it leads.
UNK: Tory Ellis : I got something on that license plate.
Tory : It turns out this isn't Arabic.
Tory : These are letters in the Thai alphabet.
Beckett : What does it mean?
Tory : That the license plate was registered in Chiang Mai,
Tory : a province in northern Thailand.
Castle : I was in Thailand, getting shot at with Chuck Norris?
UNK: Kate?
UNK: Alexis Castle : Kate, are you awake?
Beckett : Alexis, hey. Um, what's... What's wrong?
Alexis : Sorry, I have an exam, but I didn't want to leave Dad like this.
Alexis : He's kind of gone off the deep end about Thailand.
