UNK: Ta.
UNK: Bye.
Castle : Ah, thank you.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Mmm, is Alexis gone, too?
Beckett : Yeah, she had an early morning class.
Beckett : So, you were restless again last night. What's going on?
UNK: Nothing.
Beckett : Babe, you keep saying that, and it keeps getting worse.
Beckett : You're whimpering in your sleep.
Beckett : It's been every night for a week.
Beckett : So come on, talk to me.
Castle : It's just a dream.
Beckett : So, it's a recurring dream?
Beckett : Okay, about what?
Castle : About when I went missing, I think.
UNK: Um, so, why didn't you wanna tell me about it?
Castle : Probably because I didn't wanna make a big deal of it.
Beckett : But it is a big deal.
Beckett : You lost two months of your life,
Beckett : and you're dreaming about it now?
Beckett : I don't think you should ignore this.
Beckett : I do.
Castle : Come on, everything is perfect right now.
