Castle : I see blood.
Castle : There's a man on the floor.
Castle : He's been shot.
Castle : He's dying.
Castle : I'm there, too.

Burke : Can you see where you are right now?
Castle : In a storage shed.
Castle : But it seems like everything is moving.

UNK: And there's someone chasing us.
Castle : They're shooting at us.
Castle : There's a blond man.
Castle : In a truck.
Castle : He's leading the charge.
UNK: Driver, go faster!
Burke : A military truck?
