UNK: There. What did you just remember?
Castle : Just that when I was at the coffee shop, I got this strange, um,
Castle : like a buzzing, ringing in my ears.
Burke : Let's go back a week ago to the coffee shop.
Burke : What were you doing when this buzzing first started?
Castle : I was writing.
Castle : Or rather, procrastinating. I was stuck on a scene,
UNK: so I was just people-watching.
Burke : Anyone you knew? Or recognized?
UNK: No.
Castle : No, I don't think so.
Castle : Wait a minute, that ringing,
Castle : it started when I looked up at the TV.
Burke : What was playing?
Castle : Something from the local news.
UNK: April 15th is only two days away...
Tory : This is the clip you would've seen.
Newscaster : But on the bright side, many post offices will be open extra late
Newscaster : to accept tax returns from last-minute filers.
Castle : It's just some report on Tax Day.
Castle : Maybe the buzzing has nothing to do with this.
Beckett : Just keep watching. There's gotta be something else there.
