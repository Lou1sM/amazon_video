Burke : Perhaps the images came to you for a reason.
Burke : Something triggered them.
Castle : Like what?
Burke : You began having this dream over a week ago.
Burke : Did anything unusual occur on that particular day?

Castle : No, I got up, I had breakfast with Beckett.
Castle : She had to go to court. I went to the gym...
Burke : And then?

Castle : I wanted a change of scenery,
UNK: so I took my laptop to the coffee shop.
