Lanie : I found traces of talc in the victim's mouth.
Beckett : The gloves would have been bloody,
Beckett : the killer would have to get rid of them.
Beckett : They could have his prints or DNA on them.
Ryan : Right, but those gloves could be anywhere.
UNK: How would we find them?
Beckett : The department has bloodhounds.
Beckett : Call the K-9 unit, have them deploy bloodhounds
UNK: to search near Powers' apartment building.
UNK: Thanks.
Esposito : Find the gloves yet?
UNK: Oh, nothing so far.
Esposito : Yeah, not with my team either.
UNK: Well, the dogs might still come through.
Esposito : I'm not so sure.
Esposito : For all we know, the killer didn't even toss his gloves.
Ryan : So, what, he's just walking around with bloody latex?
Esposito : No, he could have put him in a Ziploc bag.
UNK: He could've burned them.
Ryan : Yeah. The thing of it is,
Ryan : even if we find the gloves, and get the killer's prints or DNA,
Ryan : and we do ID this guy, he's probably long gone by now.
Esposito : Based on what?
Ryan : Well, if he wanted information,
Ryan : he probably got it from Jeff Powers, yanking out all his teeth.
Esposito : No. Soldier like Powers, his training?
Esposito : No, he'd die before he spilled his guts.
Ryan : Hope you're wrong about that.
UNK: Because if our killer was after information,
Ryan : he may think Castle has it.
Castle : Hey. I thought you said you were staying at a friend's tonight?
UNK: No, uh, you said I was staying at a friend's.
