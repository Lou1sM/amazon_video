Castle : You defected.
Bilal : If you like.
Bilal : I hid in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand
Bilal : where I was supposed to meet my CIA contact
Bilal : and get safe passage to the United States.
Bilal : But things didn't go as planned.
UNK: And what does any of this have to do with me? Why was I there?
Bilal : Because I needed you.
Castle : Needed me? Needed me for what?
Bilal : I was about to turn myself over to the CIA
Bilal : when my contact was killed by a bullet that was meant for me.
Bilal : Now, the rendezvous point was supposed to be a secret,
Bilal : which means there was a leak.
Bilal : I could trust no one.
Bilal : I had some leverage, so I agreed to meet again,
Bilal : but only in the company of somebody I trusted, somebody I knew,
Bilal : somebody too prominent to be eliminated.
Bilal : I knew only one such man. You.
Castle : How did we end up in that truck?
Bilal : The Russian had been hunting me, hired by Al-Qaeda.
Bilal : He finally caught up with me.
Castle : That's how you got wounded. Was I wounded, too?
Bilal : Fortunately, no.
Bilal : My ride's here.
Castle : I still have a lot of questions.
Bilal : There's no more time.
Bilal : I'm sorry, Rick.
UNK: Look, I was a cause of much upheaval in your life.
UNK: Now, please know that was never my intention.
Castle : In fact, I have the deepest gratitude
Bilal : for everything that you've done.
Castle : I just wish I could remember what it was.
