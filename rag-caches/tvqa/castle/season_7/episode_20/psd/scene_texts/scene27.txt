Castle : Yeah. If I can remember about Thailand,
Castle : it may help us solve this murder.
UNK: Okay. Keep me close.
UNK: Always.
UNK: Hey, uh, Beckett?
Beckett : Hey. Please tell me we got something.
Ryan : Well, I did find this.
Ryan : A cocktail napkin from Exotica.
Beckett : I take it that's a strip club?
Ryan : Yeah. And this was in the victim's pocket.
Ryan : It could be where he was last night
Ryan : before he came home and wound up dead.
Beckett : And it might be where he met our killer.
Ryan : Yeah. I'll see if I can find out who he spent time with
Ryan : at, uh, Exotica.
UNK: Sure, I know Jeff, he's a regular.
Amber : He's at the club a few nights a week.
Amber : He's nice. Always a gentleman.
Esposito : Fact is, he was there last night, right? Was he there with somebody?
Amber : Just me.
