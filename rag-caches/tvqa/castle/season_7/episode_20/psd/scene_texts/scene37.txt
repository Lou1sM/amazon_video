Beckett : He's the only person who knows the truth.
Castle : There's at least one other person who knows.
Castle : I need to see Powers' file.
Beckett : Exactly what are you hoping to find?
Beckett : We already went over what little there is on Powers.
Castle : Yes, but you were looking for his killer.
Castle : I'm looking for this guy.
Castle : Jenkins is the mastermind behind this, or mastermind-adjacent.
Castle : He was probably in Thailand.
Castle : For all I know, he was driving the truck I was in.
Beckett : Castle, we could never locate Jenkins, much less find his real name.
Castle : But maybe now we can.
Castle : If Jenkins had contact with Powers,
Castle : there may be evidence in here that can lead us to him.
Esposito : Yo. We got a hit off that APB.
Esposito : Transit cop thinks he just saw Golovkin
Esposito : get off a subway stop at Sheridan Square.
Beckett : That's half a block from Jeff Powers' apartment.
Esposito : Yeah, maybe he went back there.
Beckett : Castle, stay put, okay?
Castle : Yeah, you be careful.
UNK: I will. The ESU's got my back.
