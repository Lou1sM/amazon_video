UNK: Ah. So, you think he might have seen it in a film?
UNK: Maybe.
UNK: Martha. Hey, uh, what's going on?
Martha : Richard is completely obsessed. And I am concerned about him.
Beckett : I know. Me, too.
Martha : He never spoke to me about the missing time.
Martha : I thought he was at peace with it. Didn't you?
UNK: Well, I guess the dreams made him
Beckett : realize that he wasn't at peace.
Martha : He chose to forget those two months.
Martha : He must have had a very good reason for wanting to do that.
Martha : I think looking into this is a bad idea.
UNK: Martha, I don't think that this is a choice for him.
Beckett : I think that he needs to know the truth.
Martha : What if he never finds out the truth?
Martha : What if he never learns anything?
Martha : Or worse, what if he finds out something awful?
Beckett : I'll be with him wherever this leads,
UNK: and I promise you, I am not gonna let him go too far.
