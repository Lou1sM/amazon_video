Castle : That won't be necessary.
Castle : All the answers are right behind this door.
Beckett : Castle, what are you doing?
Castle : It's okay. He knows me. Jeff Powers?
Castle : It's Rick Castle from Thailand. Your door was unlocked.
Castle : Just wanted to ask you a few questions.
UNK: Castle?
Castle : That's him.
Castle : That's the guy in my dream.
UNK: Well, needless to say, that GSW
UNK: Lanie Parish : to the head is the likely cause of death.
Beckett : When did this happen?
Lanie : Based on liver temp, about midnight last night.
UNK: But I'll know more once I do a full workup on him.
Lanie : Castle starts remembering this guy,
Lanie : and all of a sudden he becomes a homicide victim?
Lanie : That's kind of weird.
Beckett : Yeah, it's not just weird. It's suspicious.
