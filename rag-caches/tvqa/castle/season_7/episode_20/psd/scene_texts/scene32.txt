Beckett : Castle, you can't be a part of this. Not anymore.
Castle : What do you mean? I have to be.
Beckett : We don't know this man's agenda.
Castle : No, no, Beckett, I need to be...
Beckett : What you need to do is go back to the loft and stay there.
Beckett : Now, I've assigned a security detail to you.
Castle : Why would I be a target? I don't know.
Beckett : And neither do you. But he was shooting at you in Thailand.
Beckett : And he just killed Jeff Powers, your Chuck Norris lookalike.
Beckett : Now, L.T. Is gonna drive you home.
Castle : And if I refuse?
Beckett : Then he'll drive you home in handcuffs.
UNK: Just for the record, extremely bitter.
Beckett : I'll call you if we find anything.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : Lanie, hey. What'd you find?
Lanie : Well, for one thing, Mr. Powers' blood work came back.
Lanie : He had antibodies for dengue fever.
Ryan : Just like Castle.
Lanie : Similar strain, too.
Lanie : But the main attraction is what I found in the man's mouth.
UNK: Huh.
Ryan : Or rather what you didn't find.
Beckett : What happened to his teeth?
Lanie : They were pried out, eight of 'em, shortly before he died.
Ryan : So, Powers was tortured first. Revenge?
Beckett : Or the killer wanted information.
Beckett : Did he leave any evidence behind?
Lanie : I'm afraid not.
Lanie : Looks like he wore latex gloves.
