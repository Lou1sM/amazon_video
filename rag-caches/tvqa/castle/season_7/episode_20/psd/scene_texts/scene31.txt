UNK: The Federal Plaza, Church Street and Chinatown post offices
UNK: will all have extended hours on the 15th...
UNK: Wait, um, pause it, pause it.
Castle : Of course...
Beckett : What is it?
Castle : Tory, zoom in on that man right there.
Castle : I know him.
Castle : He was the one chasing us in the truck.
Martha : Are you sure?
Castle : Yes, I'm sure. He was in Thailand.
UNK: Yo. We got our sketch back of the guy
Esposito : who showed up at the strip club asking for Jeff Powers.
Castle : It's the same man.
Castle : First in Thailand, now in New York.
Castle : Whoever he is, he's at the center of this.
Castle : Just catching a glimpse of his face is what started all this.
Castle : It's what triggered my dreams. But who is he?
Beckett : What else do you remember about him?
UNK: Uh, he was dressed like a soldier.
Beckett : You said he was yelling at his men. In what language?
UNK: Faster! Faster!
Castle : He was speaking English.
Ryan : So was he American? British?
UNK: No, but I think he had an accent.
Esposito : So, European, maybe.
Esposito : I'll run his photo through Interpol, see if they know him.
UNK: And I'll have unis canvass where that video was taken
UNK: and see if anyone in that neighborhood recognizes him.
Castle : Thanks, guys. Okay, what else can we do?
