Castle : did something terrible.
Castle : I know you.
Alexis : You would never do anything bad.
Castle : I could never leave the love of my life,
Castle : desert her and you for two months.
UNK: Yet somehow I did.
UNK: Castle.
Castle : How did we ID this guy?
Ryan : By way of a bloodhound named Cujo.
Esposito : Cujo sniffed out a paper bag in a storm drain
Esposito : about four blocks away from the crime scene.
Esposito : The bag contained latex gloves.
Castle : And we're sure these gloves belong to the killer?
UNK: Yeah. The bag had teeth in it, too.
Ryan : In any case, CSU was able to pull prints.
UNK: We got a hit off ECRIS, the European fingerprint network.
Castle : - So the killer's European? - He's Russian.
UNK: Ilya Golovkin. Castle, does that name sound familiar?
Castle : No. Who is he?
Esposito : He served in Spetsnaz, Russian special forces...
UNK: Then moved on to the former KGB.
Castle : The Russians are behind this?
Beckett : Doubtful. He left Russia five years ago and disappeared.
UNK: Since then, word is that he's been responsible
Esposito : for over two dozen assassinations.
Ryan : Including politicians, dissident journalists,
Ryan : protected witnesses, even a Vatican banker.
Esposito : Golovkin's the guy you call when
UNK: you have a job that no one else can do.
UNK: Castle, if Golovkin is involved, then whatever is going on,
Beckett : whatever you were a part of, it's something big.
Esposito : Here you go.
Castle : How do we even track down a guy like Golovkin?
Beckett : We called in reinforcements. We're coordinating with the FBI.
Beckett : Every state and federal law enforcement agency
Beckett : is looking for this guy,
Beckett : and when we find him, you will have your answers.
