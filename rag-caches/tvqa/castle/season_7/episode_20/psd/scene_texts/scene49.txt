Martha : You saved tens of thousands of lives?
Alexis : And went on a secret mission to Thailand?
Castle : Yes, unfortunately I cannot divulge any further specifics.
Alexis : If you told us, you'd have to kill us?
Castle : You mock, but it is for your own safety.
Alexis : I guess what really matters is you found out the truth, Dad.
Alexis : And the good news is it didn't turn out
Alexis : to be your worst-case scenario.
Castle : Yeah. Bad news is I can't brag about my heroic exploits to anyone.
