Esposito : and some old buddy from high school?
Beckett : Come on, guys, I'm just asking you
Beckett : to run Phil Bartlett.
Beckett : Look, Castle needs to know what's going on.
Ryan : What if these leads go nowhere?
Beckett : Then he needs to know that as well.
Beckett : Excuse me. Tory!
Beckett : Hey, any more news on that license plate?
Tory : A little. The plate was registered to a Thai freight company
Tory : that went out of business in 1987.
Beckett : 1987? How would Castle see it on a truck almost 30 years later?
Tory : I don't know. It's possible the plate was stolen, or...
Beckett : Or what?
Tory : I ran an image search of the plate.
Tory : Similar license plates appeared in several actions films,
Tory : during car chase sequences.
UNK: Ah. So, you think he might have seen it in a film?
UNK: Maybe.
UNK: Martha. Hey, uh, what's going on?
Martha : Richard is completely obsessed. And I am concerned about him.
Beckett : I know. Me, too.
Martha : He never spoke to me about the missing time.
Martha : I thought he was at peace with it. Didn't you?
UNK: Well, I guess the dreams made him
Beckett : realize that he wasn't at peace.
Martha : He chose to forget those two months.
Martha : He must have had a very good reason for wanting to do that.
Martha : I think looking into this is a bad idea.
UNK: Martha, I don't think that this is a choice for him.
