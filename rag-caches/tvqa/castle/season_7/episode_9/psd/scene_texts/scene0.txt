Castle : You know, I don't think I'm gonna miss this place.
Beckett : What do you mean?
Castle : Well, the floors creak,
UNK: and we can hear everything Mr. Kubiak does in his bathroom.
Beckett : You never said anything about it before.
UNK: That doesn't matter now. You're moving out.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Thanks.
Castle : You okay?
Beckett : Yeah, sure. I'm fine.
UNK: Which can't be said for our dead guy.
