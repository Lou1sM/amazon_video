UNK: And then the next morning, Lance was dead.
UNK: I figured Boothe's guys got to him.
Trey : Look, I was at my office all night. I slept there.
Trey : The cleaning crew saw me.
Trey : I swear to you, I did not kill Lance.
Trey : And I don't know who did.
Castle : Tell me, Trey. Why would Lance go through all this trouble to help you?
Beckett : I don't know.
Trey : He just said that the cancer really woke him up,
UNK: and that after all this was over,
Trey : there were some things that he wanted to tell me.
Beckett : So the cleaning crew confirmed Trey's story. He is not our killer.
Castle : Well, maybe it was one of Boothe's men.
Castle : We still haven't ruled them out.
Ryan : Hey, guys. I just found something very interesting.
Castle : The identity of the killer.
Ryan : No, not that.
Ryan : You know how Trey said that Lance's cancer woke him up?
Ryan : Well, I just spoke to his doctor.
Ryan : When Lance got the name of his bone-marrow donor, to thank him,
UNK: he found out there was a second donor who was a very close match.
UNK: Take a look at that name.
