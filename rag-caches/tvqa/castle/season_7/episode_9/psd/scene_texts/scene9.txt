UNK: Was that you?
UNK: Yes.
Beckett : Do you want to elaborate on that?
Kat : Lance called me that night. From a payphone, I think.
Kat : He said he was in trouble and that people were after him.
Beckett : What people?
Kat : He didn't say.
Kat : But he asked me to pick him up at this theater playing Hard Kill,
Kat : that it would be easy to find.
Kat : He sounded so desperate. But when I got there
Kat : he was dead.
Beckett : Why didn't you tell us this before?
Kat : I panicked.
Kat : I'm trying to restart my career. I just knew how it might look.
