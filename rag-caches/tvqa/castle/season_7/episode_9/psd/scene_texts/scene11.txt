Castle : Lance took on a mission.
Beckett : Oh, okay. So we're back to "one last mission," now.
Castle : Why else would he have the schematic?
Castle : Or the listening device? Or why would he need a bodyguard?
Beckett : To protect himself from Kat Kingsley.

Ryan : came from a payphone six blocks from the movie theater.
Beckett : All right, canvass for witnesses that saw Lance or anyone else by that payphone.
Beckett : And if he was in trouble, as Kat said,
UNK: then let's find out where he was coming from.
Ryan : We'll get into it. But we might not have anything till the morning.
UNK: Okay.

Lanie : But to you, this is where you rebuilt your life.
Lanie : Where you solved your mother's murder.
Lanie : Where you fell in love.
Beckett : Well, to the best apartment ever.
