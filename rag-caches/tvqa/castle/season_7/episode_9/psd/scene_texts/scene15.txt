Brock : Let's roll.
Beckett : So, um,
Castle : what's going on?
UNK: No warrant is gonna stop us
Clay : from getting our hands on evidence to put away Lance's killer.
Brock : Somebody takes out one of our own, we take him out.
Castle : Oh. Guys...
Castle : Hey, listen, if your plan is to go to the club and steal that slot car...
UNK: No, no, that would... That would taint the evidence.
Rolf : Actually, we can compel the DA to consider it
Rolf : since the car technically belonged to the victim, Lance.
Castle : You really are a genius, aren't you?
Rolf : And also, none of us is an agent of the law.
UNK: That's one of the reasons I chose you.
Serafina : And because you have been in Boothe's office.
UNK: You're gonna help us find that slot car.
Castle : No. No, no.
UNK: Guys, my wife is a cop. If I do this, she'll kill me.
UNK: "Oh, my wife's gonna kill me!"
Brock : Is that what Rico Cruz would say?
Castle : No, but what if we get caught?
UNK: We're not gonna get caught.
UNK: We're The Indestructibles.
UNK: Tense up, guys, it's showtime.
