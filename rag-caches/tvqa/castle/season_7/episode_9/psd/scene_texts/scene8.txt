Kat : I was not following him.
Kat : He asked me to meet with him.
Beckett : And he told you to wear a disguise?
Kat : I couldn't be seen with him.
Kat : After the gun thing, we were told to avoid contact.
Kat : But Lance begged me.
Kat : He needed cash. $200,000.
Beckett : He asked you for a loan?
Kat : His assets were all tied-up with the divorce.
Kat : I inherited some money. He knew I had access to it.
Kat : It wasn't a loan. He sold me his half of the Malibu house.
Beckett : Are you telling me that he traded you $4 million for 200,000?
Kat : How could I pass up a deal like that? I have the promissory note to prove it.
Beckett : Why did he need the money?
UNK: He said he needed to set something right.
Kat : That he wanted to live up to the characters he'd played, I think.
Kat : I wasn't really listening.
Kat : I just wanted him to sign over the house.
Kat : I'm just being honest.
UNK: Okay, fine. If you're being honest, then why don't you tell me this.
UNK: We have a witness that saw a dark figure fleeing the crime scene.
