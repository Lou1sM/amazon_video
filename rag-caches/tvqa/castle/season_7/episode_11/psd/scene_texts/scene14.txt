UNK: Maybe. Maybe.
Castle : All right, this is crazy.
Castle : If we both have something, why don't we just trade?
Beckett : Castle, I can't. You know that.
Castle : Oh, can't!
Esposito : What happened to that rebellious girl
Castle : with the leather jacket and the motorcycle?
UNK: Would she say "can't"?
Beckett : She enforces the law now, and drinks expensive wine.
Castle : Then think about our victim.
UNK: Are you really gonna let a couple of silly rules
Castle : stand in the way of bringing Shana justice?
Beckett : Okay, fine.
Beckett : We'll do it just this once. For her.
UNK: You first. You first.
Castle : We'll go at the same time.
UNK: Ready? Yeah.
Beckett : She was looking into old police records...
UNK: Shana had an old boyfriend who died at Radnor University.
Beckett : Wait. She had an old boyfriend who died at Radnor University?
Beckett : How long ago? Fifteen years.
UNK: His name was Jeff Whalen.
Castle : He drank too much at a party and fell out a window.
Beckett : If she was looking into old police records...
Castle : And interested in homicide laws...
UNK: She must've thought that his death
Beckett : was more than just an accident.
Castle : She was investigating a murder.
Beckett : And somehow that got her killed.
Castle : Oh, my God. I missed this.
Perlmutter : Last night was amazing.
UNK: Wait.
Beckett : Are you talking about the put-together we did on the case, or...
UNK: That. But the put-together, that was pretty amazing too.
Beckett : It's been forever since we tried that.
