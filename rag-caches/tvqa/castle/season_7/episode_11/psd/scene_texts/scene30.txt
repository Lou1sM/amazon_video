Gates : Mr. Castle, I got an urgent call
Nicole : to meet you here regarding Shana Baker.
Castle : Yes. Yes, just one final question, Miss Morris.
Castle : Who hired you to kill Shana Baker and frame Spalding Elliot?
Nicole : What are you talking about?
Castle : I think you know.
Castle : That's you retrieving Elliot's cigarette butt
Castle : so you could plant it at the crime scene after you killed Shana.
Beckett : Nicole Morris, you're under arrest for the murder of Shana Baker.
Castle : You know, I always heard Harrison and Reid were a killer law firm.
Castle : Now, I know why.
Castle : Case closed.
Castle : You think we'll ever know who Nicole Morris works for?
UNK: Ah, she's not gonna tell us.
Beckett : But we did find several large payments wired to her account,
UNK: and Elliot is determined to find their source.
Castle : I would be determined, too.
Castle : That guy would be spending time in jail,
Castle : if it wasn't for a dog named Sparkles.
Beckett : And a PI named Castle.
Beckett : I'm proud of you. I just...
UNK: I thought this was another one of your larks. A way to kill time.
UNK: But you impressed me.
Beckett : You know, I kind of impressed myself.
Castle : I got all sorts of ideas for my new book.
