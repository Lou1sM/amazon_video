Elliott : I'm being set up. Mr. Elliot...
Elliott : Shana said somebody contacted her
UNK: and told her that I pushed Jeff.
Elliott : They urged her to "look into" the truth.
UNK: And then she ends up dead,

UNK: I'm a criminal prosecutor.
Elliott : Do you honestly think that I would be stupid enough
Elliott : to leave a piece of evidence like this behind?
Elliott : Look, I made my name fighting corporate greed.
