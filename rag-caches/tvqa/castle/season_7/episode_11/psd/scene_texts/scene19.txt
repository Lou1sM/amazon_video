Ryan : We still can't find Jackson.
Ryan : He's not at his apartment and he's not answering his phone.
Beckett : Okay, put out an APB.
Beckett : If he's Shana's killer, then he may try to run.
Esposito : Yo, that was the Ledger. One of Jackson's co-workers said
Esposito : that he saw him leave the building about an hour ago,
Esposito : with some guy who looked like Castle.
UNK: Then Castle found Jackson?
Beckett : And he has no idea how dangerous he is.
Beckett : Damn it, Castle, answer.
Beckett : Why can't he just stay out of this?
Castle : When have I ever stayed out of anything?
Beckett : Oh, thank God. Now, what are you doing here?
Castle : I know the rules, but given who I'm with,
Castle : I thought we might make an exception.
Frank : I knew this day would come.
Frank : When Shana called the other night,
Frank : I was almost relieved.
Castle : Just tell Detective Beckett what you told me.
Castle : About why she called.
Frank : It was about her boyfriend.
Frank : She wanted to know how Jeff Whalen really died that night
Beckett : at Radnor University.
Frank : Jeff was pretty wasted. He went upstairs to get some air,
Frank : and the next thing I remember was the scream.
Frank : Now, I didn't see what happened,
Frank : but I know Jeff wasn't alone in that room when he fell out the window.
Beckett : You think that he was murdered?
Frank : All I know is the next day I was pressured to change the story.
Frank : I was told to take out any mention
Frank : of who was in the room with him.
UNK: But who pressured you?
Frank : Someone big.
Frank : He said he was just trying to protect his son's reputation.
Frank : He told me he could ruin my life,
Frank : or he could do great things for me.
