Castle : No, last night, it was anything goes.
Beckett : Yes, Castle,
Beckett : and it was great.
Beckett : Come on, we both know it was just a one-time thing.
Castle : You know, I thought we had something special!
Beckett : Is that the file?
UNK: Yeah, and it looks like your 2 : 00 a.m. hunch paid off.
Ryan : What were you doing up so late anyway?
Beckett : I was working on the case.
UNK: Huh.
Ryan : Well, I don't know what Shana was looking to find in that report,
Ryan : but it refers to witness statements taken at the party
Ryan : where Shana's boyfriend, Jeff Whalen, died.
Ryan : But the witness statements, as well as the list of people who gave them,
Ryan : they're all missing.
Beckett : The file's been tampered with?
Ryan : It looks that way.
UNK: When I called over to Radnor, they said
UNK: that those pages must have been lost
Ryan : when their records were digitized 10 years ago.
UNK: What about the officer that wrote the original report?
Ryan : Passed away a few years back.
Beckett : Okay, if the information is missing,
Beckett : then what did Shana learn from this report that got her killed?
Ryan : According to the guy in the records department,
Ryan : when Shana finished with the archive,
Ryan : she asked for directions to the alumni office.
