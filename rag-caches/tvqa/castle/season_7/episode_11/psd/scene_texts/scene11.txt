Castle : No! Shh! Don't think about it.
Castle : Just think about how it feels when we work together.
Castle : Besides, we have the place to ourselves. Who's gonna know?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah.
Beckett : It's work. Don't answer it.
Beckett : No, but I have to.
UNK: Hi, Espo. What's up?
Esposito : So, you asked me to dig deeper on Brian Whitman,
Esposito : see if there were any other connections to Shana.
Esposito : Well, you'll never guess what I found.
Beckett : No! No, you're right, that can't be a coincidence.
Castle : What's not a coincidence?
Beckett : Okay, bring him in.
Castle : Bring who in?
UNK: I'm sorry, baby, I gotta go.
UNK: Mwah. You're not gonna tell me anything?
Castle : You said married people tell each other things!
Whitman : Who the hell do you think you are, Detective?
Whitman : Why am I back here?
UNK: Uh, Mr. Whitman, please.
Beckett : You know, you're a generous man.
Beckett : You support charitable causes,
Beckett : you sit on the board of numerous esteemed organizations,
Beckett : including Radnor University.
UNK: So?
Esposito : So, just before Shana Baker died, she took a trip to Radnor.
Esposito : You know anything about that?
Whitman : - Sorry, can't help you. - I think you can.
Beckett : Her trip, your position on the school's board
UNK: and her helping getting your son into that preschool.
Beckett : I think those three are related.
