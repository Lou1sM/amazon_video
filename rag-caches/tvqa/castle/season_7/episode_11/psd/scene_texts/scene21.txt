Beckett : Who pushed Shana's boyfriend out the window?
Frank : The last person I told that, um, wound up dead.
UNK: I mean, you sure you really wanna know?
Gates : Let me get this straight.
Gates : You think federal prosecutor Spalding Elliot killed Shana Baker?
Beckett : The events support it, sir.
Beckett : According to Mr. Jackson, right after Shana spoke to him,
Beckett : she went to confront Elliot about his role
Beckett : in her former boyfriend's death.
Castle : And he's a parent at her school, so she knew where to find him.
UNK: Look, it's no secret that Elliot is being groomed for bigger things.
