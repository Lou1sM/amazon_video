Castle : Just one thing didn't work out as planned.
Beckett : You know that if this was up to me,
Beckett : we would be working together, right?
Castle : Yes, but since it's not, and we can't,
Castle : I was wondering how you'd feel if I kept with this for a while.
Beckett : Don't move.
UNK: Hmm.
Castle : What's this?
Beckett : It's my answer.
UNK: I am so gonna wear this to work tomorrow!
Castle : Keep going, there's something else.
Beckett : So, maybe you can use that to locate an actual client.
UNK: I can see something I like better already.
Castle : You care to go into the other room and share?
Beckett : On one condition. What?
Beckett : The hat stays on.
UNK: Mmm!
