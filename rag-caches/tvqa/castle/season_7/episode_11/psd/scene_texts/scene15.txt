Beckett : I forgot how creative you can get.
Castle : We're not talking about the case anymore, are we?
UNK: Mmm-mmm.
Beckett : Hey, Ryan.
Beckett : Great. Okay, how long before the file...
Beckett : Before it gets there?
Castle : Before what gets there?
Castle : You were about to say "files," weren't you?
UNK: No!
Castle : Oh, you texted Ryan last night about Shana's old boyfriend
Castle : and told him to get those old police files for you,
Castle : while you were in bed with me.
Beckett : Ryan, I'll be right over.
UNK: Well, you're gonna let me take a look at those files, right?
Castle : I mean, that's only fair.
Beckett : Castle, I can't.
UNK: That would be crossing the line.
Castle : You didn't seem to care about lines last night.
