Beckett : So, Shana called Frank as part of her investigation.
Beckett : She knew that if he was president of that club,
UNK: he must've been at the party that night.
UNK: And if there was a cover-up, he would've been in on it.
Beckett : Then he could be our killer.
Castle : Excuse me, Mr. Jackson!
UNK: I wanted to talk about an article you edited about 15 years ago,
Castle : about a student who died at the Tiger Claw Social Club.
UNK: I'm sorry, I'm late. Another time.
Castle : You left something out of that article, didn't you?
Beckett : Something about how Jeff Whalen really died.
UNK: Who did you say you were again?
UNK: I'm Richard Castle.
Castle : I'm a private investigator working the Shana Baker murder.
Frank : Okay, not here.
Frank : I know somewhere nearby. It's more private.
