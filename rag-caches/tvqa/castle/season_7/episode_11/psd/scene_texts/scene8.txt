Castle : So, Detective, so long as you're here,
Castle : would you care to sit in on my interview?
Nicole : I had no idea she had been killed
Nicole : until you called. It was quite a shock.
UNK: Miss Morris, how well did you know Shana?
Nicole : Not very. I met her a few months back
UNK: when I toured Eastbourne School for my daughter.
Nicole : We hit it off, but I decided not to apply this year,
Nicole : so I was surprised when she called the other day.
Nicole : She said it was urgent, that she needed to meet before she left town.
