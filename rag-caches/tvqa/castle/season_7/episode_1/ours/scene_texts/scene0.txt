UNK: Yes, this is she.
Beckett : - Beckett! - Castle!
UNK: Javier Esposito : Stay back! There's nothing you can do!
UNK: No!
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Oh, my God!
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Castle.
Beckett : It's empty.
Beckett : He's not here!
Beckett : He's not in the car!
UNK: You sure he's not in the car?
Beckett : Even with a fire that hot, there'd still be a body.
Beckett : He's gotta be nearby.
Martha : You really think he...
Beckett : He's here, he has to be.
Beckett : We have to start a search. We could use more men.
UNK: Sergeant! I'm Detective Beckett, NYPD.
Beckett : The man that was in that car is one of our own.
Beckett : We need to scrub every inch of this area.
UNK: Sergent Taggert : I'll get my men on it.
Ryan : You have search and rescue dogs?
Taggert : I'll call them in. Okay.
Beckett : I need to help them.
Esposito : You're no use to anyone dressed like that.
Esposito : We'll get started here, you go change.
Martha : Come on, let's get you into some other clothes.
Beckett : Okay, I'll be right back.
UNK: All right, I'm gonna search up near the road.
