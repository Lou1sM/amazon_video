Castle : But I'm pretty sure I've never been here.
Beckett : Okay, this is it. This is where your tent was.
Castle : No. None of this looks familiar.
Beckett : Castle, just tell me the truth.
Beckett : You owe me that much.
Castle : I am telling you the truth. I was not here.
Beckett : Well, your clothes were here. Your watch was here, your tuxedo.
UNK: The one that you were gonna wear when you married me.
Castle : It must have been planted here, you know, along with...
Beckett : Nothing was planted, Castle. It was you. It was your DNA, your prints.
Castle : Must have been a mistake at the lab.
Castle : There have been numerous cases...
Beckett : I believed in you.
Beckett : I convinced myself that the evidence didn't matter.
Beckett : That everything that seemed so obvious couldn't possibly be true.
Beckett : I was searching for you,
Beckett : I didn't even know if you were alive, or if you were dead.
Beckett : And you were right here, right where you wanted to be.
Castle : I promise you,
Castle : I did not pitch a tent here.
Castle : I could not have.
Beckett : I saw it for myself, Castle.
UNK: I would never camp in this spot.
Castle : Not after the research I did on Tropical Storm.
Beckett : I can't even do this with you.
Castle : Hey, wait, listen.
Beckett : You never wrote a book called Tropical Storm, Castle.
Castle : Kate, wait.
