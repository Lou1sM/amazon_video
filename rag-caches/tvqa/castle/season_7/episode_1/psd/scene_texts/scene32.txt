UNK: We ran prints and passport. He's definitely the real Henry Jenkins.
Castle : Which means the first guy was a fake Jenkins.
Castle : Also a liar.
Esposito : But he matched the DMV photo.
Castle : That's because his photo got switched.
Castle : When we called the DMV,
Castle : they realized their system had been hacked two days ago,
Castle : right after the news broke that I'd been found.
Ryan : What about all your stuff in the tent?
Beckett : Well, it looks like it was all set up
Beckett : in order to create a false trail.
Esposito : So why don't you remember anything?
Castle : These people have managed to make it look
UNK: as though I staged my own abduction.
Castle : They hacked the DMV,
Castle : they provided a false Jenkins who pointed you to doctored evidence
Castle : that I'd gone camping.
Esposito : Whoever they are, they have unlimited resources.
Castle : Maybe the kind of resources that would
Castle : allow them to alter someone's memory.
Esposito : What about the money?
Castle : What money?
Esposito : We have you on video dropping off $10,000 in a dumpster
Esposito : after you were taken.
UNK: Yeah, I can't explain the money yet.
Castle : But I will, and fake Jenkins was part of the set-up.
Castle : So, whoever he is, he's somehow in the middle of this.
Martha : Here you go, darling.
