Cardano : Okay, listen.
Cardano : On occasion, clients might need to make a vehicle disappear.
UNK: And for 10 grand, such a thing can be handled.
Beckett : What was the name of the client?
Cardano : No names came up.
Cardano : He called me in the morning. He said the right things.
Cardano : We struck a deal.
Cardano : But I never met the man. It was all anonymous.
Ryan : Then how did you get paid?
Cardano : We used a drop.
Cardano : The client left a bag full of cash
Cardano : in a dumpster on the Lower East Side,
Cardano : right after the SUV got turned into a panini.
UNK: After?
UNK: What happens if you crush a car
Ryan : and then you don't get your money?
Cardano : That does not happen.
Beckett : Where exactly is this dumpster?
UNK: Tory Ellis : Based on what Cardano said, this is the drop point.
Esposito : Now, what are we looking at here?
Esposito : This is not street cam footage.
Tory : There's no coverage in the area.
Tory : But after a rash of break-ins,
Tory : one of the buildings installed hidden cameras,
Tory : and I was able to tap in.
Tory : This is in the time window when the drop should have taken place.
Ryan : We get eyes on Cardano's client,
Ryan : we can get a real lead on who took Castle.
Beckett : There. Go back.
Ryan : That's him, that's the client, dropping off the cash.
Esposito : I'll set up a canvass.
Esposito : Someone had to see where this guy came from or where he went.
UNK: Yeah, this is Esposito. Connect me with...
Beckett : Wait. Freeze that. Zoom in.
Ryan : It can't be.
Esposito : It is. That's Castle!
Esposito : He's the one who dropped off the cash?
Tory : Do you want me to run it again?
UNK: I need to get some air.
UNK: Yeah, Tory, one more time, please.
UNK: What are you gonna see that you didn't see before?
Ryan : Maybe we missed something. Yeah, we missed something!
Esposito : Castle's in on this. He planned the whole thing.
Ryan : Maybe it isn't really him.
