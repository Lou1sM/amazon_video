Beckett : These are Castle's shoes.
UNK: This is his watch.
UNK: Newspapers, dating back two months.
Esposito : Clothes, supplies... He has everything here.
UNK: He could've walked up to that trailer
Esposito : and made a phone call.
Esposito : He never did.
UNK: What?
Esposito : Castle's wedding tux?
Beckett : Castle's awake.
Martha : It's wonderful news.
Martha : The doctor just told me Richard will make a full recovery.
Martha : Oh! I am so relieved!
Martha : Oh. And I was right there when Richard started to wake up.
Martha : First thing he did was ask for you.
Beckett : Did he say where he had been?
Martha : We don't know what he's been through,
Martha : so perhaps that question can wait.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey.
Castle : Just so you know, the doctor said
Castle : that kissing will speed my recovery.
Beckett : Kissing can wait, Castle.
UNK: Right.
Castle : Sorry. I guess I put a little kink in our wedding plans.
UNK: Yeah, is that supposed to be a joke?
