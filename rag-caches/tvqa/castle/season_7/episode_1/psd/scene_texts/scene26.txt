Esposito : So your boat was missing, but you didn't report that?
Jenkins : I never use the damn thing.
Jenkins : I mean, I don't even know why I bought it.
Jenkins : I just figured it came unmoored, or it got stolen.
Ryan : Who would steal a dinghy?
Jenkins : Well, there was a man who was hanging around,
Jenkins : down by the beach. A man?
Beckett : Describe him.
UNK: Um...
Jenkins : Late 30s, I would guess. Tall, brown hair, big build.
Jenkins : Yeah. That's definitely him.
Beckett : He was on the beach? What was he doing?
UNK: Camping.
UNK: Camping?
Esposito : That can't be right.
Jenkins : In a tent.
Jenkins : He seemed to be minding his own business,
UNK: and he was on state land, so I just left him alone.
UNK: Ryan, can you finish taking Mr. Jenkins' statement?
Beckett : Where exactly was this man?
Esposito : That's the dock where the dinghy was tied up.
