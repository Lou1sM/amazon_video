Beckett : He's not here!
Beckett : He's not in the car!
UNK: You sure he's not in the car?
Beckett : Even with a fire that hot, there'd still be a body.
Beckett : He's gotta be nearby.
Martha : You really think he...
Beckett : He's here, he has to be.
Beckett : We have to start a search. We could use more men.
UNK: Sergeant! I'm Detective Beckett, NYPD.
Beckett : The man that was in that car is one of our own.
Beckett : We need to scrub every inch of this area.
UNK: Sergent Taggert : I'll get my men on it.
Ryan : You have search and rescue dogs?
Taggert : I'll call them in. Okay.
Beckett : I need to help them.
Esposito : You're no use to anyone dressed like that.
Esposito : We'll get started here, you go change.
Martha : Come on, let's get you into some other clothes.
Beckett : Okay, I'll be right back.
UNK: All right, I'm gonna search up near the road.
Ryan : Maybe Castle managed to bail out before the car crash.
Esposito : All right, we'll start on the car.
Esposito : See if we can tell what happened and where he went.
Ryan : All right.
Taggert : Airbag went off.
Taggert : It only activates when someone's in that seat,
Taggert : so your man was definitely at the wheel.
