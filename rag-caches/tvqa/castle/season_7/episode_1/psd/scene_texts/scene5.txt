Beckett : Who was in it?
Gary : You know what? I want a lawyer.
UNK: Ahh!
Beckett : You're a low-level dirtbag, Gary.
Beckett : You're not a criminal mastermind, so start talking.
UNK: Ahh!
Beckett : Who was in the car? Who had you crush it?
Beckett : Was Castle in the car?
Beckett : Was he in the car? Was he alive?
UNK: Ahh!
UNK: You're gonna break my finger!
Beckett : And then after that there's nine more.
UNK: So tell me what I wanna know.
Beckett : Start talking.
UNK: I got nothing to say.
Beckett : What? What is it?
Esposito : Forensics came back on the SUV.
Esposito : There was no blood or tissue. Castle wasn't inside.
Beckett : Okay. So he's still out there.
Beckett : Which means they crushed the car to cover their tracks.
Beckett : Okay, get CSU to sweep for DNA and prints.
Beckett : And let's move Gary Duffin to a holding cell.
Esposito : So you can do what to him?
Esposito : I was watching.
UNK: Getting booted off the force is not gonna help anything.
Beckett : Espo, he knows who took Castle.
Esposito : Well, he's never gonna give them up.
Esposito : Whoever they are, he's way more
Esposito : afraid of them than he is of you.
Beckett : Fine, we'll try another angle. For now.
UNK: Thanks.
Ryan : So, we are dead-ended on the SUV.
Ryan : Ran the VIN number, turns out that it was stolen
UNK: from a long-term parking lot near JFK
Ryan : with conveniently lousy video surveillance.
UNK: Okay, let's dig deeper
UNK: into our car crusher, Gary Duffin.
Beckett : Look into his background, his known associates.
Beckett : That might lead us to whoever took Castle.
Esposito : We're on it.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : Detective. Do you have a moment?
Beckett : Yes, sir.
Gates : How are you holding up?
Beckett : I'm fine.
Gates : I truly can't imagine what you're going through,
Gates : how you can focus at a time like this.
UNK: Uh, sir, please don't take me off of this case.
