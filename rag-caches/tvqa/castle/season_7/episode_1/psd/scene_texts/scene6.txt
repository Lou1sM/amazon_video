Gates : Oh, I won't. Unless you give me cause to.
Gates : You keep doing what you're doing.
Beckett : Okay, thank you.
Gates : And you should know,
UNK: we're using every resource that we have to find Mr. Castle,
Gates : including calling in the FBI.
Gates : There's a Special Agent Connors waiting to speak with you.
Beckett : Sir, with all due respect, I'm under the gun here.
Beckett : I don't have time to bring the FBI up to speed.
UNK: Special Agent Connors : I'm already up to speed, Detective. I just have a few questions.
Gates : Kate, they can help.
Connors : I understand investigating this case
Connors : puts you in a terribly difficult position.
UNK: Yeah.
Connors : But I need to talk to you about Mr. Castle.
Connors : Outside of his family, you're the one who knew him best.
Beckett : Yeah, well, he didn't have any problems
Beckett : with gambling, money, drugs, affairs.
Beckett : So we can skip all of that.
Connors : I understand he was headed to the Hamptons
Connors : when he was abducted.
Beckett : Yeah, for our wedding.
Connors : Who knew he was making that drive?
Beckett : The wedding guests, um...
Beckett : Catering staff.
Connors : I'll need their names.
Beckett : I've got a list.
Beckett : But they're all friends and family.
UNK: Still.
Beckett : Agent Connors, do you think that
Beckett : this could be a ransom kidnapping?
Connors : If it is, we'll be ready.
