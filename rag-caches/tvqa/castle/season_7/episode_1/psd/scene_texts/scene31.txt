Castle : There have been numerous cases...
Beckett : I believed in you.
Beckett : I convinced myself that the evidence didn't matter.
Beckett : That everything that seemed so obvious couldn't possibly be true.
Beckett : I was searching for you,
Beckett : I didn't even know if you were alive, or if you were dead.
Beckett : And you were right here, right where you wanted to be.
Castle : I promise you,
Castle : I did not pitch a tent here.
Castle : I could not have.
Beckett : I saw it for myself, Castle.
UNK: I would never camp in this spot.
Castle : Not after the research I did on Tropical Storm.
Beckett : I can't even do this with you.
Castle : Hey, wait, listen.
Beckett : You never wrote a book called Tropical Storm, Castle.
Castle : Kate, wait.
UNK: Listen.
Castle : I started the book, I threw it out.
UNK: It was a... Supervillain controls the weather...
UNK: It was terrible. But it...
Castle : The research I did on catastrophic storms,
UNK: it stuck with me,
Castle : leaving me with an irrational but overpowering fear of tsunamis.
Beckett : You bought a beach house in the Hamptons.
UNK: Yes, on the inland side, not on the ocean side.
Castle : Kate, I would never camp here.
Castle : I would go for higher ground.
UNK: Castle, there was a witness.
Castle : What witness?
Man : Can I help you?
Beckett : Yeah, NYPD. I'm here to see Henry Jenkins.
Man : Well, I'm Henry Jenkins.
Beckett : I'm sorry, I was here yesterday
Beckett : and I met a different Henry Jenkins.
Castle : What do you mean? I'm Henry Jenkins.
Man : And I haven't been here in months.
