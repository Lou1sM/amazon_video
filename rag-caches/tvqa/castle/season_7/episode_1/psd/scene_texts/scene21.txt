Esposito : Not yet.
Beckett : And, Espo, you know what? If you're wrong, then he was a victim.
Beckett : So instead of us just standing around waiting for him to wake up,
Beckett : why don't we start by figuring out who owns that dinghy?
Ryan : I'm already on it.
Ryan : Boat had expired tags registered
Ryan : to a Curtis Holt of Savannah, Georgia.
Esposito : We called Holt.
Esposito : He said that he sold it over a year ago at a garage sale.
Esposito : He can't recall who he sold it to.
UNK: Okay, check his story, find the current owner.
UNK: We find the owner, we'll figure out where Castle was coming from.
UNK: In the meantime, I'll talk to the ship's captain
