UNK: Captain Mundy : I'm guessing he'd been in that vessel four or five days.
Beckett : Okay, could the dinghy have come from a larger boat?

Mundy : And the position of the fenders points to it being moored at a dock.
Beckett : Is there any way to know where that dock is?
Mundy : I can give you my best guess.
