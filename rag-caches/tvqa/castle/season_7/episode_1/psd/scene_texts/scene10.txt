Beckett : Find out what he did,
Beckett : who he talked to just before he went missing.
UNK: And brief Agent Connors.
UNK: What are you gonna do now?
UNK: I'm gonna talk to his family.
Alexis : And these images were taken after the accident?
Alexis : The car fire?
UNK: Yes.
Martha : So he's alive.
Martha : He's not being held captive by God-knows-who.
Alexis : Wait, are you saying Dad was run off the road by an SUV,
Alexis : and after that, he paid to have it crushed?
Beckett : It looks that way, yeah.
UNK: Well, that's ridiculous.
Martha : Why on earth would he do such a thing?
Beckett : Was he going through anything that I didn't know about?
Martha : Like what?
Beckett : Pressure that he was under that he kept to himself.
Alexis : Of course not. Right, Gram?
Beckett : No, no, no, no. I would have noticed.
Beckett : And what about the wedding?
Beckett : Did he have any misgivings?
