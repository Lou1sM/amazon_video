Martha : Then what's going on here?
Beckett : I don't know.
UNK: But there's gotta be another explanation.
UNK: Agent Connors : I don't think there is.
UNK: Agent Connors : The video clearly shows Castle out in the world,
UNK: Agent Connors : not under duress.
UNK: Agent Connors : It changes the dynamics of the case.
Beckett : No, this is still a kidnapping.
Beckett : That video could be a fake.
Beckett : All it shows is Castle throwing away a bag.
UNK: That could've been shot a month ago.
Beckett : It wasn't.
Connors : Our tech team analyzed the footage.
Connors : It's authentic.
Connors : Were you aware he withdrew a large sum
Connors : just before he disappeared?
Beckett : Yes, it was for our honeymoon.
UNK: Vinnie Cardano turned over the 10,000 dollars
Connors : that was left in the dumpster.
Connors : It's the same money that Castle withdrew.
