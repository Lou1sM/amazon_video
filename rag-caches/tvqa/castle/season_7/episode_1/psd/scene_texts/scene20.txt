Lanie : I'll see what I can do.
UNK: Okay. All right.
Ryan : I'm with Beckett. I never thought we'd see Castle again.
Esposito : Still, where's he been?
Ryan : You saw those bullet holes.
Ryan : Maybe he used the boat to escape from whoever abducted him.
Esposito : The guy faked his own kidnapping and then ran off.
Esposito : Now, how could he do that to Beckett?
Ryan : As long as we've known him, worked with him?
Ryan : Don't you think Castle deserves the benefit of the doubt?
