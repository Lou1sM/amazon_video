Castle : And to my amazing mother,
Castle : my wonderful daughter,
Castle : and the love of my life.
Beckett : And to coming home.
Beckett : We'll find out what happened.
Beckett : I know.
Castle : I was just thinking,
Castle : I feel like I just wore this yesterday.
UNK: Like we slept in this bed last night.
Castle : For you, it must seem like a lifetime ago.
Beckett : Yeah, it does.
Castle : How did you not lose hope?
Beckett : I did lose hope, you know?
Esposito : But I...
Beckett : I would get it back.
Beckett : Developed rituals in order to hang on to it.
Martha : Like what?
UNK: It's stupid. It really doesn't matter.
Castle : I'd like to know.
Beckett : I would stare at your photo on the murder board.
Beckett : And I started thinking that if I would look at it long enough every day
Beckett : that that would keep you alive.
Castle : I guess it worked.
Beckett : And then I had this thing about your chair.
Castle : My chair at the precinct?
Beckett : I wouldn't let anyone touch it.
UNK: And then a night janitor came by, tried to move the chair,
UNK: and I freaked out and I almost shot him.
UNK: Um...
Castle : I am so sorry.
UNK: For everything I put you through.
