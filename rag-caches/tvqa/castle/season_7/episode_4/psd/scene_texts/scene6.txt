Castle : anything these little charmers can throw my way.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: In this case, it's an eraser.
Beckett : Hey, what do you got?
Esposito : We chased down that partial plate that Anton's teacher gave us.
Esposito : That car she saw?
Esposito : Looks like it's registered to a retired cop
UNK: named Clark Jaffe.
Beckett : A cop?
Esposito : Yeah. Anton placed a call to him that night
UNK: from a pay phone outside the college.
Beckett : Okay, bring him in.
UNK: That's gonna be a problem.
Esposito : Jaffe's dead. Shot to death.
Beckett : He was shot too? When?
