Ryan : They're blank.
Beckett : What was Anton doing with these?
Sergei : I've never seen them before today.
Sergei : What was my son involved in?
Ryan : He was studying graphic design.
Ryan : Do you think he was forging passports?
Beckett : Mr. Vetotchkin, I need to ask you, do you recognize this man?
Sergei : Yes. That's Dmitri. Dmitri Kalenkov.
Beckett : And how do you know him?
Sergei : He and my son grew up together back in Abkhazia during the war.
UNK: Is Dmitri involved in this, too?
Beckett : I'm sorry, just one moment.
