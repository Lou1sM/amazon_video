Emily : Do you like to play princess with him?
UNK: Uh...
UNK: Sometimes.
Emily : Are you two getting married?
UNK: One day. One day.
UNK: Now is our chance. I'll take the front, you guys take the back.

UNK: Yeah, but these are second-graders.
Beckett : I mean, don't their drawings look the same?
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Not to me, Detective.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : When you live and breathe these children,
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : every scribble is like a fingerprint.
UNK: Can't imagine they'll need much prompting when we confront them.

Jason : why are you going through my desk?
UNK: Jason?
Castle : You're the witness?
Jason : I'm not talking to Mr. Castle. He's a jerk face.
Castle : Okay, you know what? He's the jerk face!
Beckett : He's eight years old.
Beckett : You've been here for a day-and-a-half
Beckett : and you already have a nemesis?
Castle : How was I supposed to know he'd be the witness?
