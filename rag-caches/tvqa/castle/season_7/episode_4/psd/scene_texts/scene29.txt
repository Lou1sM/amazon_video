Esposito : Can you describe him?
Natalie : Yeah, I can do better.
UNK: Wait a second. You're saying she's got a picture of Polkovnik?
Beckett : Yeah, in an envelope at her apartment,
Beckett : along with other information on him.
UNK: Why?
Ryan : Because we looked into this guy, Polkovnik.
UNK: Suffice to say, he's wanted for a lot more than just three murders.
Beckett : Here in New York?
UNK: No, in the Abkhazia region of Georgia, 10 years ago.
Ryan : He's wanted by the World Court for war crimes.
Esposito : He was a militia leader.
Esposito : Committed atrocities, wiped out villages,
Esposito : including where Anton and Dmitri lived.
Esposito : That's why they fled. Interpol's been after this guy ever since.
UNK: They got a tip that Polkovnik was in New York,
Castle : so they're tightening the net.
UNK: Only one problem, there's no pictures of this guy.
Castle : So no one knows what he looks like.
Ryan : And he wants to keep it that way.
Ryan : So when Dmitri tried to take justice into his own hands,
Ryan : Polkovnik killed him.
Ryan : Then he tracked down Jaffe and Anton and killed them, too.
Ryan : He knew that they could ID him.
Beckett : That's what he was looking for,
Beckett : the picture that Anton was gonna use on his passport.
Castle : A passport that he desperately needs to get out of this country.
UNK: Okay, that photo is at Natalie's place. Let's go.
Beckett : He's been here.
Castle : Natalie said it was in the bedroom dresser, bottom right drawer.
UNK: Okay.
