Beckett : I followed up on Jaffe's car. There's no GPS, no E-ZPass,
Beckett : there's no way of finding out where he and Anton went that night.
Beckett : Okay, what about you on financials?
Esposito : For an ex-cop, the guy lived like a monk.
Esposito : So did Anton, which is part of our problem.
Esposito : The kid had no cell phone, no credit cards to pull.
Esposito : There's gotta be a connection between these two guys, I'm just not finding it.
Esposito : But here's what I don't get.
UNK: What's a 22-year-old ice cream man doing with an ex-cop anyway?
Ryan : I may have a lead on that.
Ryan : I was looking into the ice cream truck.
Ryan : It was ticketed last week up on Marble Hill,
Ryan : which is nowhere near Anton's route.
UNK: So...
UNK: So I checked into Clark Jaffe's financials.
Ryan : Jaffe's credit card shows
Ryan : that he parked at a meter the exact same block, on the same day.
Beckett : That's not a coincidence.
Ryan : This is traffic cam footage of Anton's truck that day.
Ryan : Now watch.
Esposito : He goes into that shipping store. What's he doing in there?
UNK: I've no idea. But I scrubbed all the footage.
Ryan : This is from an hour earlier.
Beckett : A green Camry.
Beckett : And that's Clark Jaffe.
Esposito : Going into the same store.
Beckett : So what were the two of them doing?
