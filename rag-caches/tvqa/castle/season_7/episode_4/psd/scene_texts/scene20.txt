UNK: Hey.
Castle : Beckett, you need to come down here. I found something.
Beckett : Castle, whoever put this in your pocket...
Castle : Is sending me a message.
Castle : Our witness is reluctant to come forward,
Castle : but when they saw I was leaving, it forced their hand.
Beckett : Have you tried just asking who drew it?
UNK: I don't wanna scare them off. But I have a plan.
