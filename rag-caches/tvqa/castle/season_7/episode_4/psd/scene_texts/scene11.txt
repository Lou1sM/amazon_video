Castle : I found it!
Castle : I think I found our witness!
Castle : Right here. It's Jack.
Castle : He wrote a story about an evil giant,
Castle : which from a child's perspective is how the killer would seem.
Castle : He said that the giant spoke in a loud, angry voice, said mean things,
Castle : and promised he would hurt someone.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : That's just Jack and the Beanstalk.
Castle : Yes, but in this story, the giant had a gun.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Okay. Let's say you're right.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Let's say Jack was hiding in the ice cream truck
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : and he's afraid to tell anyone.
UNK: How are you gonna get him to tell you?
Castle : Keep moving. Move up. More bad guys. Cover me.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Got 'em! Nice work.
UNK: Whoa! Wait a minute. I think I see more bad guys ahead.
UNK: Uh-oh. What?
UNK: There's a giant. And does he?
Castle : Yeah, he does. He's got a gun.
Jack : No, get down! He's gonna shoot it!
Castle : You think?
Jack : He did last time. He said, "I'm gonna shoot."
Jack : Then he did.
Castle : Last time, like in your story?
Jack : Yes. He shot his gun. Bang! Bang!
Jack : And then the other guy was bleeding.
Castle : Only it wasn't a story, was it, Jack? It really happened.
Jack : I was scared. I closed my eyes until the giant disappeared.
Castle : Hey, man, you were very brave.
Jack : That's not what my brother said.
Castle : Your brother was there?
UNK: He said, "Don't be a chicken, it's just a stupid movie."
Jack : Then he changed the channel.
Castle : The giant was on TV?
UNK: Yeah. Mmm!
Jason : Mr. Castle wet his pants! Mr. Castle wet his pants!
UNK: Oh!
UNK: No, no, I... It's just, the ground was wet.
Clerk : Yeah. Anton and Mr. Jaffe, they come in here a lot.
Clerk : Uh, Anton rented a P.O. box here about six months ago.
Clerk : Box 552. And he shared it with Jaffe.
Beckett : They were sharing a P.O. box?
UNK: Yeah.
