UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : I didn't do much to deserve it.
Beckett : Are you kidding? You put up with Castle for two whole days.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : I enjoyed the challenge.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : In my experience, it's the most difficult children who prove most rewarding.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Isn't that right, Mr. Castle...
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Mr. Castle! No faces. That's right.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Oh!
Jason : See you later.
UNK: Later, Jay.
UNK: I guess that's me.
Beckett : What's wrong?
Castle : It's Alexis texting me.
UNK: "Be sure you come home right after school."
Castle : How'd she even know I was here right now?
