Castle : Because I disappeared.
Castle : But I'm back now,
Castle : and I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to stay.
Alexis : I just keep thinking I'll lose you again,
Beckett : or something terrible will happen.

Castle : No, no, it does not sound crazy.
Castle : I would feel the same way. Matter of fact, I did.
Alexis : After Paris.
Castle : After Paris, I couldn't let you out of my sight.
