UNK: I... I can't.
Castle : Jason, believe me,
UNK: it's gonna feel a lot better letting it out rather than keeping it in.
Jason : No! I can't because I wasn't there!
Beckett : You weren't?
Jason : But I know who was.
UNK: Who?
Jason : I'm not supposed to tell.
Beckett : Jason, listen, we just wanna help you, okay?
Jason : It was my sister.
Beckett : Okay. Does she go to this school, too?
UNK: She's a grownup.
Jason : We have different dads.
Jason : I stay with her when our mom goes out of town.
