Beckett : Natalie, what did you see in that van?
Natalie : Anton had left a message for me
UNK: to meet him at his ice cream truck,
Natalie : away from his usual route.
Natalie : And when I got there, he said that Jaffe was dead,
Natalie : and that this man had killed him
Natalie : and that he was afraid that we would be next if we didn't run.
UNK: And then Anton saw him coming. So he told me to hide.
Natalie : And I watched.
Natalie : I watched as Polkovnik gunned Anton down.
UNK: Did you see his face?
