Beckett : What kind of mail were they getting?
Clerk : That's the thing. They weren't getting any mail.
Clerk : At least not that I ever saw.
Esposito : Then why did they need the box?
Clerk : All I know is they both came in twice a week to check it.
UNK: Together?
Clerk : No. Usually about an hour apart.
Esposito : They were using it as a dead drop.
Beckett : Yeah, but for what?
UNK: Uh, when was the last time you saw them?
UNK: I saw 'em both last week.
Clerk : But Anton came in yesterday,
Clerk : and he seemed a little worked up after I told him about the phone call I'd got.
Esposito : What phone call?
Clerk : Some dude with a Russian accent called, asking me who owned box 552.
Clerk : Anton's box.
Clerk : I told the caller we don't give out that kind of information.
Clerk : But when I mentioned the call to Anton, he flipped out.
Esposito : So Anton knew this guy. Yeah.
UNK: I guess so, 'cause he went into total panic mode,
Clerk : said he had to use the phone.
Clerk : But I couldn't let him use it, it's against company policy.
Clerk : So he just raced out of here.
Beckett : What time was that?
UNK: 3 : 00. Okay, thanks.
UNK: 3 : 00 p.m. That's two hours before Anton was killed.
Esposito : Sounds like this Russian dude was coming for him.
Esposito : Who do you think Anton was trying to call? Jaffe?
Beckett : Or someone else connected to all of this.
Beckett : Look, Anton didn't have a cell,
Beckett : so if he really needed to make a call, he'd go nearby.
Esposito : I'll canvass all the stores in the area,
Esposito : see if anyone let Anton use their phone.
UNK: Great. And, uh, school's almost out.
UNK: I'll get a hold of Castle and see if he's gotten any closer to finding our witness.
UNK: Uh, no, no breakthroughs yet. But the good news is, um,
Castle : it looks like they've accepted me as one of their own.
UNK: Guys, guys, give me the wallet. That was a gift.
UNK: Oh, right in my...
Beckett : Wait, what is going on over there? Is there a problem?
Castle : No, everything's fine. I'll talk to you tonight.
UNK: Okay. Bye-bye.
Castle : Okay, guys, very funny. Give me back the wallet now.
Castle : Mrs. Ruiz! A little help here?
UNK: No, huh?
UNK: Here, here!
UNK: Oh!
UNK: Okay, hey. That's got... Okay.
UNK: Whoa! Whoa!
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Children, line up in the hall for dismissal.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Mr. Castle, are you okay?
Castle : Oh, yes, I am. I'm fine. Thank you, Emily. Very kind.
Emily : I know how it feels.
Emily : Sometimes bad things happen to me, too.
Castle : They do? Mmm-hmm.
Emily : Really bad things.
Emily : Things I didn't want to tell Mrs. Ruiz
Emily : when she asked me this morning.
Castle : Well, things like what?
Emily : Like yesterday. I was...
UNK: Emily? Come along, dear. We don't wanna be late for the doctor.
Emily : Will you be here tomorrow?
Castle : You can count on it.
Beckett : So, Esposito confirmed with Emily's parents
UNK: that her 14-year-old brother was supposed to be watching her that day,
Beckett : but he was playing video games,
Beckett : and he didn't check on her for hours.
UNK: So she could've sneaked out.
Castle : It is her, Beckett. I knew it.
Beckett : Which is why we should have talked to her at her place last night.
Castle : And risk intimidating her? No, no.
UNK: No, this girl's... She's ready to open up to me.
UNK: We have a special connection.
UNK: Really? Should I be worried?
UNK: Only that I'm gonna solve the case before you.
UNK: Oh!
Alexis : Where do you think you're going?
UNK: Um, second grade?
Alexis : Not without finishing your breakfast.
Castle : I ate most of it, and I'm just, I'm late.
Alexis : Come on, Dad. Just one more bite.
UNK: Alexis, I'm not a...
Alexis : Now don't forget your lunch.
Castle : Okay, you're right. It's weird. I'll talk to her.
UNK: Okay. But right now,
Castle : I'm late for a tea party.
Castle : Thank you so... Oh, that's plenty.
Castle : Did you make this tea yourself?
UNK: Mmm-hmm. I have to say, it's excellent.
Beckett : Thank you. No, thank you.
Emily : Do you want some sugar?
Castle : Actually, I'm trying to cut back.
Castle : Do you have any low-calorie fairy dust?
