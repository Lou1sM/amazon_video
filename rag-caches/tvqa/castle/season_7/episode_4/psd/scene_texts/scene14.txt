UNK: Something...
Emily : You're making the wall too high.
Castle : Oh, sorry.
Castle : Is that better? All right.
Castle : You said it was something that you didn't want to tell Mrs. Ruiz about.
Castle : Do you think maybe you'd wanna tell me?
Castle : Okay. You know, you could, if you wanted.
Castle : It would just be one princess to another.
Emily : Because princesses help each other?
Emily : Because princesses help each other.
Emily : It's about Jason.
UNK: Jason... The kid who makes faces, Jason?
Emily : He's a bully. He says mean things and pulls my hair.
Emily : This morning, he stepped on my foot. On purpose.
Castle : Emily, do you know why people do mean things?
Castle : 'Cause it makes them feel strong.
Castle : Really, though, you and me, we're the strong ones.
Castle : We just keep our strength inside,
Castle : so sometimes we forget it's there.
Emily : Like sometimes I forget I have gum in my pocket.
UNK: Exactly.
Castle : So, next time Jason does something mean,
Castle : you just use that strength, and just let it go.
