Esposito : So Anton called Dmitri to smooth things over.
Ryan : And ended up taking two in the chest.
Esposito : Thanks, L.T.
Esposito : Organized Crime just got a current address on Dmitri.
Castle : All right.
UNK: NYPD!
UNK: Dmitri Kalenkov! Hands up! NYPD!
Beckett : Hands up!
UNK: NYPD!
Beckett : Hands up! Oh. Oh.
Esposito : That smells good.
UNK: Oh, Jeez!
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Found him.
Esposito : It's Dmitri.
UNK: He's been shot. He's been dead at least a couple of days.
Ryan : Hey, Beckett. Check it out.
Ryan : Electrical cable, car battery, leads.
Beckett : He was tortured first.
Lanie : Well, someone might have been tortured here, but it wasn't Dmitri.
Beckett : Are you sure?
Lanie : The only injury I see besides bullet wounds
Lanie : is a blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
Lanie : And by the look of the contusion,
Lanie : I would say it was made by that broken chair arm.
Esposito : So if Dmitri wasn't tortured, maybe he was the one doing the torturing.
Esposito : It fits the profile of a mob enforcer.
Beckett : Which means whoever was tied in that chair
Beckett : broke free, overpowered Dmitri and then shot him.
Beckett : How long has he been dead?
Lanie : I'd say at least three days.
Esposito : So Dmitri was killed before Jaffe and Anton.
Lanie : And most likely by the same shooter. Same two taps to the chest.
UNK: Okay. Thanks, Lane.
UNK: Why kill a mob enforcer, an ice cream man and a retired cop?
Beckett : What were they mixed up in?
Esposito : I don't know, but it's starting to look like a Russian thing.
Esposito : Anton, Dmitri, the guy who called the mailbox store...
Beckett : Okay, touch base with Organized Crime again.
Beckett : Let's see if there's a conflict in the Russian community.
Castle : All right.
Ryan : Hey. That was Anton's parents.
UNK: Somebody just broke into their apartment and tossed the place.
Esposito : Just like Jaffe's place was tossed.
UNK: The killer is after something.
Beckett : Something that our victims had.
Ryan : Yeah, but what?
UNK: Goodbye. Bye, sweetheart. Bye, Mr. Castle.
Castle : Bye, Fiona. Bye, June. Bye, Sophie.
UNK: Thank you, Mr. Castle.
UNK: Bye, Sarah. Bye. Bye.
Castle : Have a good one, buddy.
Castle : Jack, you make sure you keep your guard up on that battlefield.
Castle : All right. Bye, sweetheart.
UNK: Bye.
Emily : You're leaving?
Castle : Oh. Yeah, Emily. I gotta go.
Emily : Is it because I got you in trouble?
Castle : Oh, no. No, Emily, that's not your fault.
Castle : I'm always in trouble.
Castle : Come here.
Castle : You make sure you use your princess powers for good, okay?
UNK: Bye.
Castle : Bye, guys.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Never thought I'd say this, but I'm sorry to see you leave.
Castle : Thank you very much, Mrs. Ruiz.
UNK: Mrs.ruiz : Please call me Leslie.
UNK: Mrs.ruiz : I'll contact you if there are any new developments.
Castle : I appreciate that. Take care.
