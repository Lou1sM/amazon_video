UNK: 3 : 00. Okay, thanks.
UNK: 3 : 00 p.m. That's two hours before Anton was killed.
Esposito : Sounds like this Russian dude was coming for him.
Esposito : Who do you think Anton was trying to call? Jaffe?
Beckett : Or someone else connected to all of this.
Beckett : Look, Anton didn't have a cell,
Beckett : so if he really needed to make a call, he'd go nearby.
Esposito : I'll canvass all the stores in the area,
Esposito : see if anyone let Anton use their phone.
UNK: Great. And, uh, school's almost out.
UNK: I'll get a hold of Castle and see if he's gotten any closer to finding our witness.
UNK: Uh, no, no breakthroughs yet. But the good news is, um,
Castle : it looks like they've accepted me as one of their own.
UNK: Guys, guys, give me the wallet. That was a gift.
UNK: Oh, right in my...
Beckett : Wait, what is going on over there? Is there a problem?
Castle : No, everything's fine. I'll talk to you tonight.
UNK: Okay. Bye-bye.
Castle : Okay, guys, very funny. Give me back the wallet now.
Castle : Mrs. Ruiz! A little help here?
UNK: No, huh?
UNK: Here, here!
UNK: Oh!
UNK: Okay, hey. That's got... Okay.
UNK: Whoa! Whoa!
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Children, line up in the hall for dismissal.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Mr. Castle, are you okay?
Castle : Oh, yes, I am. I'm fine. Thank you, Emily. Very kind.
Emily : I know how it feels.
Emily : Sometimes bad things happen to me, too.
Castle : They do? Mmm-hmm.
Emily : Really bad things.
Emily : Things I didn't want to tell Mrs. Ruiz
Emily : when she asked me this morning.
Castle : Well, things like what?
Emily : Like yesterday. I was...
UNK: Emily? Come along, dear. We don't wanna be late for the doctor.
Emily : Will you be here tomorrow?
Castle : You can count on it.
Beckett : So, Esposito confirmed with Emily's parents
UNK: that her 14-year-old brother was supposed to be watching her that day,
Beckett : but he was playing video games,
Beckett : and he didn't check on her for hours.
UNK: So she could've sneaked out.
Castle : It is her, Beckett. I knew it.
Beckett : Which is why we should have talked to her at her place last night.
Castle : And risk intimidating her? No, no.
UNK: No, this girl's... She's ready to open up to me.
UNK: We have a special connection.
UNK: Really? Should I be worried?
UNK: Only that I'm gonna solve the case before you.
UNK: Oh!
Alexis : Where do you think you're going?
UNK: Um, second grade?
Alexis : Not without finishing your breakfast.
Castle : I ate most of it, and I'm just, I'm late.
Alexis : Come on, Dad. Just one more bite.
UNK: Alexis, I'm not a...
Alexis : Now don't forget your lunch.
Castle : Okay, you're right. It's weird. I'll talk to her.
UNK: Okay. But right now,
Castle : I'm late for a tea party.
Castle : Thank you so... Oh, that's plenty.
