UNK: Get up.
Emily : You okay?
Castle : Yeah, I've taken worse.
Castle : In this classroom, as a matter of fact.
Castle : Cupcake stampede!
UNK: Come and get 'em, guys!
UNK: Here we go! One for everyone. Help yourselves.
Castle : This is just a little thank-you
Castle : to say what a wonderful time I had with all of you.
UNK: Thank you, Mr. Castle. Here you go. You're welcome!
UNK: Thank you, Mr. Castle.
UNK: I'm gonna miss every one of you.
Jason : Even me?
Castle : Yes, Jason. Even you.
Castle : What do you say? Truce?
Jason : Yeah. Truce. All right.
Beckett : Looks like your nemesis isn't ready to call it a truce just yet.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Especially when he sees what I put on his back.
Castle : Leslie, one for you?
UNK: Kate Beckett : No, thanks.
UNK: Oh, well, actually, we have something else for you as well.
Beckett : This is a medal of outstanding service from the NYPD
Beckett : for your invaluable help with tracking down our witness.
UNK: What's gonna happen to Jason's sister anyway?
Beckett : She's agreed to testify, and with her help, our three victims,
Beckett : along with many, many other people, will finally get justice.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Then maybe you should give this medal to her.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : I didn't do much to deserve it.
Beckett : Are you kidding? You put up with Castle for two whole days.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : I enjoyed the challenge.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : In my experience, it's the most difficult children who prove most rewarding.
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Isn't that right, Mr. Castle...
UNK: Mrs. Ruiz : Mr. Castle! No faces. That's right.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Oh!
Jason : See you later.
UNK: Later, Jay.
UNK: I guess that's me.
Beckett : What's wrong?
Castle : It's Alexis texting me.
UNK: "Be sure you come home right after school."
Castle : How'd she even know I was here right now?
Castle : She put one of those tracker apps on my phone!
UNK: Uh, Castle, uh, this is getting a little out of hand.
UNK: Yeah, I'm gonna have to deal with this.
Castle : And I think I know how.
Alexis : Dad, what took you so long? School ended hours ago.
Castle : Alexis, sweetheart.
UNK: I've been really worried!
Castle : Yes, I know. And I think I know why.
Castle : Because I disappeared.
Castle : But I'm back now,
Castle : and I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to stay.
Alexis : I just keep thinking I'll lose you again,
Beckett : or something terrible will happen.
Alexis : I know it sounds crazy...
Castle : No, no, it does not sound crazy.
Castle : I would feel the same way. Matter of fact, I did.
Alexis : After Paris.
Castle : After Paris, I couldn't let you out of my sight.
Castle : But I know that you consider yourself the adult of the family.
Alexis : For good reason.
Castle : For very good reason.
UNK: But...
Castle : But part of being an adult
Castle : is realizing you can't always protect the people you love.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay.
Alexis : Being an adult really sucks.
Castle : Yeah, and you've spent way too much time having to be one. So...
Castle : I'm ordering you to be a kid.
Alexis : Don't you think I'm a little old for that?
UNK: I am not too old for it, so you are definitely not too old for it.
Castle : Don't you think we should at least test them out?
UNK: Okay. Okay.
UNK: Where do you wanna go?
UNK: Sergei Vetotchkin : I don't know. Ice cream?
Castle : How about pizza? After this case,
Castle : I might be off ice cream for a while.
UNK: Okay.
