Ryan : Now, how did Luca and Eric cross paths in the first place?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : You guys,
Beckett : I found a slug.
Beckett : Call CSU.
UNK: Hey, I found something else.
Ryan : Check this out.
Beckett : That's blood.
Castle : Rocco, you must be privy to the inner workings of the family.
Castle : Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
UNK: I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a yes.
UNK: So, first of all, how well did you know Eric Mercer?
Castle : You're a man of few words, Rocco. Very, very few words.
Castle : How about Luca Tessaro?
Castle : Eric have any history with him?
Rocco : Luca's a sore subject.
Rocco : A sore subject. Why, because he's a Tessaro?
Rocco : Because he's a stain upon this family.
Castle : Okay, I take it Eric didn't like him.
Rocco : Eric hated Luca.
UNK: We all do. For what he did to Jane.
Castle : Dino's daughter? How is she involved?
Rocco : One night, she's at this club.
Rocco : Luca was there, and he tried to have his way with her.
Rocco : Word got back to Dino.
Rocco : He was ready to kill Luca, wanted to pull the trigger himself.
Castle : And did he?
UNK: Mmm-mmm. Jane stopped him.
Rocco : She didn't want a war between the families.
Rocco : Besides, she's a woman who can take care of herself.
Castle : Hey, Beckett. I just got some very interesting news.
Beckett : Yeah, so did I.
Beckett : We found blood evidence at the scene where Luca was shot.
Beckett : Go on.
Beckett : It was Luca's blood on a bracelet.
Beckett : CSU pulled a thumbprint off of it that matched a DMV record.
Beckett : For Jane Scarpella. She's Dino's daughter.
Beckett : Look, it's possible that Jane killed Luca,
Beckett : she got Eric to help cover it up, and then she killed him, too.
UNK: I just... I don't know what her motive would be.
Castle : I think I do.
Beckett : Good, then let's hear it.
Castle : Can't. I gotta go. I'll call you back and tell you later.
Castle : I hope.
Rocco : The boss will see you now.
