Ryan : I heard Dino Scarpella and Castle had a sit-down.
Ryan : What do you think that's about?
Esposito : I don't know. But I don't like him going around us like this.
Lanie : Hey, baby.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey!
Lanie : Javier, these are my parents, Walter and Melinda.
UNK: How you doing... Oh, okay.
UNK: Walter Parish : We're huggers in the Parish family, son.
UNK: Walter Parish : And go ahead, call me Dad.
Esposito : Oh, okay.
Esposito : Ooh, I can see where Lanie gets her beautiful eyes from.
Esposito : And her medical brain must come from you.
UNK: I hear that you're a surgeon?
UNK: Cardiothoracic. But retired.
UNK: Melinda Parish : No shop talk, dear.
UNK: Melinda Parish : The only talk I want is to hear the story.
Lanie : What story?
Melinda : The proposal, of course.
Lanie : Oh! That story! Right.
UNK: Javi?
Esposito : Yes, the story.
UNK: Um... Well, we, um...
Esposito : You know, baby, you tell it so much better than me.
Beckett : Why don't you...
UNK: Detective Mcbride : This guy! You should have seen him.
Ryan : He rows Lanie out into the middle of the Central Park boat pond.
Ryan : He gets down on one knee,
Ryan : so nervous he nearly capsizes the boat,
Ryan : almost sends them both into the water.
Ryan : That's just what Lanie did,
UNK: when she saw that ring. Ah!
Ryan : Perfect fit. Right.
Ryan : I'm Kevin, by the way.
UNK: Espo's partner and, you know, proposal planner in crime.
