Castle : Dino, we know Eric worked for you,
Castle : but who would wanna do this to him?
Castle : Can you help us out?
Dino : Sadly, I have no help to offer.
Dino : But please, stay, enjoy yourselves.
Dino : It's on the house.
UNK: Uh, Mr. Scarpella...
Christopher : Like he said, we got nothing for you.
Beckett : Hey, Espo.
Esposito : So while you and Castle were busy getting lap dances,
Esposito : Ryan and I did some real police work
UNK: and found a Carlucci connection to the murder.
UNK: Yeah, wait. What kind of a connection?
UNK: Well, turns out the family's number two, Christopher Carlucci,
Ryan : owns a black Mustang.
Ryan : Guess what was stashed inside?
Beckett : A Santa suit. With blood on it.
Dino : Christopher Carlucci,
Beckett : we need to talk.
Beckett : Why did you kill Eric Mercer?
Lanie : I didn't.
Beckett : Okay, then why don't you clear this up for me?
Beckett : Where were you at the time of the murder?
Beckett : And why did witnesses see your Mustang at the crime scene?
Beckett : And why did we find a Santa suit
Beckett : stuffed in the trunk of your car with Eric's blood on it?
Beckett : Look, Christopher, I don't think you just woke up one morning
Beckett : and decided to kill the family doctor.
Beckett : That kind of order comes from above.
Beckett : Did Dino Scarpella give the order?
Christopher : I want a lawyer.
Ryan : I wonder why the Carluccis would kill their own doctor.
Castle : Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.
Castle : Let the wrong mobster die on his table.
Beckett : Excuse me. Yeah.
Castle : Richard Castle.
Dino : Rick, we need to talk.
