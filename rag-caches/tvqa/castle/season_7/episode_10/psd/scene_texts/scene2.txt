UNK: My... My parents kind of think we're engaged.
Esposito : Why do they think that?
Lanie : Well, you and I were on-again, off-again,
UNK: and they just got so worried about their unmarried daughter that...
Esposito : So you told them we got engaged?
Lanie : I didn't mean to, it just popped out.
Esposito : Now, how does something like that just pop out?
Lanie : I wanted them to stop bugging me.
Lanie : I'm sorry, Javi, but once I said it, there it was.
Lanie : And now here they are.
Esposito : So the first time I meet your parents,
Esposito : you're asking me to lie to them?
Lanie : I'll be lying to them too, but I've been doing it longer.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: Can I just bring 'em down to the precinct
Lanie : to say hello?
Lanie : And you could just pretend for 10 minutes.
