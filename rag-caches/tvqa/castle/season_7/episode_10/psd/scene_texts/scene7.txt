Beckett : He said he wanted you to meet him at the strip club? Why?
Castle : He just said that it was urgent.
Castle : And when Dino Scarpella issues an invitation,
UNK: you don't RSVP with "no."
Beckett : Yeah, you do, especially if he put a hit out on Eric Mercer.
Castle : Look, he called me at the precinct,
Castle : he knows I'm married to you.
Castle : I'm in no danger here.
Beckett : Oh, God, Castle, this just sounds like an epitaph.
UNK: Um, you know what? I'm gonna go with you.
Castle : He said to come alone.
UNK: You're gonna have to trust me on this.
UNK: Dino, he's an honorable man.
Beckett : Yeah, well, I bet that's what Eric thought, too.
Dino : Buy yourself something nice, sugar, okay?
Dino : Take your mind off this tragedy.
Dino : And don't tell your mother, okay?
Jane : Thanks, Daddy.
UNK: Jane,
Dino : the roll of cash she spends on clothes could choke a horse.
Dino : I even bought an imitation couture company,
Dino : but the fake stuff isn't good enough for my girl. Right?
UNK: Especially now. She's upset. She and Eric,
Dino : they were very close, very close since they were kids.
Castle : So you're admitting he was your doctor?
Dino : I don't like that word, "admit."
UNK: Acknowledging?
UNK: Wow, Rick, me and you, we had a good relationship once, huh?
