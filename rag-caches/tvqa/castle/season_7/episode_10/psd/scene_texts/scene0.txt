UNK: Richard Castle : just a reminder that your portion for the holiday poem

UNK: Kate Beckett : Yeah, absolutely.
UNK: Gonna be the best year ever. Yeah.
Castle : So excited!
Beckett : You guys, I completely forgot.
Beckett : He said that it wasn't a big deal,
Beckett : but I think it actually kind of is.
Alexis : It's a very big deal.
Alexis : We even get a little competitive.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : I started working on mine in July.
Alexis : Welcome to the family. Yeah.
Beckett : So what do I have to do again?
Alexis : Write six funny, poignant, eloquent lines
Alexis : describing highlights of the past year for you.
Beckett : Oh, yeah.
Alexis : And they must rhyme. Yeah.
Beckett : What word rhymes with "I'm screwed"?
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : It's just that rhyming isn't exactly my thing.
UNK: This coming from the woman who skipped prom
Castle : to crash a poetry slam.
Beckett : Spoken word, Castle.
Beckett : That's a totally different jam.
