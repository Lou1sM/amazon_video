Dino : I swear, if the Tessaros killed my Eric,
Dino : we're going to war.
Beckett : Lovers from rival families?
UNK: Oh, that sounds like Romeo and Juliet.
Castle : Right down to Eric as the apothecary.
UNK: Yo.
Esposito : Jane's alibi checks out.
Esposito : Doorman places her at home during Eric's murder.
Beckett : What about the street cams in the area
Beckett : around Luca Tessaro's shooting?
Esposito : We looked. There's no cameras out that way.
UNK: Ugh. Which means we're dead in the water.
Castle : Which means I could be dead in the water.
Castle : If one of the Tessaros killed Luca and Eric,
Castle : we need to figure out who it was.
UNK: Well, unless you got a bud in that family, too,
UNK: they're not gonna talk.
Ryan : Luckily, a credit card just did the talking.
Ryan : Remember those hot numbers that Eric got from Rita?
UNK: Well, someone just used one of 'em to order a pizza for delivery.
UNK: It's the killer. He must've got the cards off Eric's body.
Beckett : Delivery to where?
Ryan : To a tile import business owned by Luca's cousin, Dante Tessaro.
Ryan : And with Luca out of the way,
Ryan : Dante becomes heir apparent to the Tessaro Family.
Beckett : This tile business, what's the address?
Beckett : This is it.
UNK: Luca Tessaro : One more step, and I'll blow your heads off.
Beckett : Luca Tessaro?
Castle : You're alive?
UNK: Luca, put your weapon down. Why?
Luca : So you can take me out? Finish the job?
Luca : Who sent you?
Beckett : Nobody sent us, Mr. Tessaro.
Beckett : We're not here to kill you.
Castle : As a matter of fact, we thought you were already dead.
UNK: Look, if you don't believe us,
Castle : you can always ask Jane.
Castle : Isn't that right, Jane?
Jane : Wait. It's okay, Luca. They can help.
Luca : We knew our families would never approve of what we had,
UNK: so we were gonna use the opportunity to leave the life for good.
UNK: Disappear.
UNK: Those credits cards that Eric got,
Castle : they were to help you get away?
