Lanie : I'll make it worth your while.
Esposito : Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
Beckett : So we looked into Eric's family history,
Beckett : contacts in his phone and computer.
UNK: He does not have an uncle named Edward Mercer.
Beckett : In fact, he doesn't have an uncle at all.
Castle : Then why did he miss his shift? And where did he go?
Ryan : I may have an answer to that.
Ryan : It turns out that Eric
UNK: used the Hytch rideshare app
Ryan : to catch a ride to an address in Queens tonight,
Ryan : a couple of hours before he was killed.
Ryan : In fact, he took numerous trips to that same address,
Ryan : which line up with shifts that he missed at the hospital.
Beckett : And what's at this location?
Castle : Certainly not Uncle Edward.
UNK: Offices. It's an office building
Ryan : owned by Evergreen Sanitation NYC.
Beckett : Are you sure about that?
Beckett : Evergreen Sanitation NYC is a known front for organized crime.
Castle : Why would Eric Mercer be visiting a mob-owned building?
Beckett : Let's head to Queens and find out.
Beckett : No placards, no names. It's like this whole place is unoccupied.
Castle : And yet Eric missed work to come here.
UNK: Repeatedly. Yeah.
Beckett : Oh, excuse me, sir. NYPD. Could you help...
Beckett : Wait, sir, could you please just help us? We...
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Whoa.
Castle : This is a surgical suite.
Beckett : Owned by organized crime.
Esposito : Eric Mercer wasn't just a doctor,
Castle : he was a mob doctor.
UNK: Detective Mcbride : I've worked Organized Crime 16 years,
UNK: I know most of the players.
UNK: Detective Mcbride : But this guy? No.
UNK: Well, we believe that he might have been a family doctor
Beckett : for whoever controls Evergreen Sanitation NYC.
