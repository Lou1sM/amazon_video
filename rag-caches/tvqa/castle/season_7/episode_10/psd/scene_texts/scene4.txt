UNK: Yeah, that's the Carlucci Family.
Mcbride : They've been moving up the charts
Mcbride : since Dino Scarpella took over.
Mcbride : But I didn't know that they had a doctor.
UNK: Whoa, uh, Dino Scarpella? I know that guy.
UNK: Seriously?
Castle : Yeah, he helped me with research for a Derrick Storm novel,
Castle : but back then he was just a mid-level guy.
Beckett : Detective McBride, if Eric was a doctor for the Carlucci Family,
Beckett : do you have any idea why he would've been targeted?
Mcbride : I haven't heard anything, if that's what you're asking me.
Mcbride : But, uh, the way he was killed,
Mcbride : sounds like somebody was sending a message.
Castle : Where would we find Dino Scarpella?
UNK: Uh, his main offices are over in Queens.
