Lanie : We're not engaged.
Esposito : But we could be.
UNK: Someday.
Esposito : And I don't want them to hate me then because I skipped out now.
Mcbride : So I asked around about the other crime families,
Mcbride : looked into who might've gone missing
Mcbride : or taken a bullet the last few days.
Mcbride : I think I got your guy.
UNK: 6' 1", 190 pounds.
UNK: He'd fit in those clothes.
Beckett : Luca Tessaro? Of the Tessaro crime family?
Mcbride : Yeah, and the family's beating the drums
Mcbride : because Luca disappeared three days ago.
Castle : Aren't the Tessaros and the Carluccis rivals?
UNK: No, more like sworn enemies.
Mcbride : Which could be why things went bad for your doctor.
Mcbride : You don't cross family lines.
Beckett : What do we know about Luca's disappearance?
Mcbride : Well, three nights ago, 911 got reports
Mcbride : of shots fired near his neighborhood.
Mcbride : Officers responded.
Mcbride : They didn't find anything, but Luca hasn't been seen since.
