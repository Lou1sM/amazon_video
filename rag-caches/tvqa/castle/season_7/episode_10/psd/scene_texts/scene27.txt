Castle : Now, Rita, I know this is a big ask,
Castle : but if we can figure out who owns that account,
Castle : we'll find Eric's real killer.
Rita : Now, is this Penumbra character
Luca : the same guy that framed Christopher?
Castle : We believe so, yes.
Rita : All right, fine, I'll help.
UNK: But only 'cause I don't wanna sleep alone on Christmas.
Castle : You and Christopher?
UNK: Okay, and...
UNK: You gotta be kidding me.
UNK: That's not even a clever alias.
UNK: You know, this guy might be using that alias to withdraw his cash,
Rita : but I bet he created the account remotely.
Castle : You think you can trace the account
Castle : back to the computer it originated from?
Rita : I think you should tell Christopher
Rita : he's sleeping over New Year's Eve, too.
