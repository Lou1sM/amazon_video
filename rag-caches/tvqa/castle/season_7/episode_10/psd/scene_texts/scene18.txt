Beckett : Thank you, Detective.
Mcbride : Whatever you need.
Beckett : Why would Eric treat Luca Tessaro, a member of a rival family?
Castle : See, this is the beauty of me being mobbed-up.
Castle : Temporarily. I can go straight to the source and ask Dino.
UNK: Castle, just be careful.
Beckett : If Eric treated a Carlucci enemy, then Dino had motive.
UNK: Dino is not gonna ask me to investigate
UNK: if it's gonna lead back to his doorstep.
Castle : I shall return with answers.
