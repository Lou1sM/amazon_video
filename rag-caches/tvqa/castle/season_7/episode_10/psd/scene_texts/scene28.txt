Becket : Rita determined Il Penumbra's Cayman account
Becket : was opened using a server at the Midtown Library branch.
Ryan : Public terminal. Makes sense.
Esposito : Especially since most libraries don't have security cameras.
Castle : But the convenience store across the street from this one does.
Castle : So we pulled the video feed from the same day
UNK: that Il Penumbra created the account.
UNK: It's time-stamped, so...
UNK: There.
Beckett : That's the only person who leaves
Beckett : in the minutes after the account was opened.
Beckett : Well, hello, Bad Santa.
Beckett : Thanks for coming to see us, Detective.
Melinda : Of course.
Beckett : Our investigation uncovered something
Beckett : that we hope the Organized Crime Unit might have information about.
UNK: Uh, what'd you find?
Beckett : Luca Tessaro. Alive.
Mcbride : From the clothes that you told me about,
Mcbride : I assumed that he was dead.
Ryan : He almost was.
Beckett : We believe the person that shot Luca
Beckett : also killed Eric Mercer to cover their tracks,
Beckett : which means the shooter knew that the two of them were in contact.
UNK: This shooter goes by the name of Il Penumbra. Does that ring a bell?
Mcbride : Can't say it does.
Castle : Okay. Well, this Il Penumbra,
Ryan : he planted evidence to frame Christopher Carlucci of Eric's murder,
Ryan : after using a Mustang like Christopher's to commit the crime.
