Castle : and the trail leads back to Christopher Carlucci, so be it.
Castle : But if it doesn't,
UNK: don't you wanna know who the real killer is?
UNK: Fine.
Beckett : But you have to promise that Captain Gates isn't gonna find out
Beckett : that we're poking around an already closed case.
Beckett : And you have to keep me looped in every step of the way.
Castle : I promise.
Castle : And since Dino gave me an all-access pass with the family,
UNK: I'm gonna start by talking to Christopher.
Castle : Thank you.
Ryan : I heard Dino Scarpella and Castle had a sit-down.
