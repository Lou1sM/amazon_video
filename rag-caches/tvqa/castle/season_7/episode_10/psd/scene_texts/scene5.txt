Castle : Well, we should go talk to him.
Castle : Dino knows me. He likes me.
Castle : If Eric was his mob doctor, he'd wanna help solve this.
Beckett : Assuming he wasn't involved.
Beckett : You know, I'll have Detectives Ryan and Esposito
Beckett : coordinate with you on the Mustang and ballistics.
Beckett : We'll see if any of that connects to anyone in organized crime.
Castle : Field trip to a strip club.
UNK: Castle, you keep staring like that,
UNK: you're gonna have to pay for the 2-drink minimum.
UNK: Dr. Deb Lander : I'm sorry. What were you saying?
Beckett : I wasn't saying anything. You were talking. About Dino.
Beckett : About how he's a nice guy in spite
Beckett : of the fact that he's a mobster. Really?
UNK: No, look, I know you find this hard to believe,
Castle : but he is a really nice guy.
Beckett : Yeah, sure. Up until the point
Beckett : he guts you like a fish.
UNK: Dino Scarpella : Rick, is that really you?
UNK: Dino! Oh, man.
Dino : You know, I just finished your book, Raging Heat.
UNK: Really? Terrific, wonderful story.
