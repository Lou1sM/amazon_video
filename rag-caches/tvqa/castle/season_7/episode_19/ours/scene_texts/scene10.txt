Castle : So his ex-wife decided to add him to the pile.
Elise : I'm not sure why I'm here. I've told you everything I know.
Beckett : No. Not everything.
UNK: You didn't tell us that you were lead counsel for Modesto Motors,
Beckett : and you didn't tell us about the airbags.
UNK: You know, those airbags with a habit of putting holes in people.
Beckett : Like Jody Evans.
Castle : Excuse me?
UNK: Miss Resner, why did Richie really call you the other day?
UNK: Was it to give you a little heads-up, you know, for old time's sake?
Castle : Because that defect he helped cover up back then,
Castle : you were in on that, too.
Beckett : He was going public with it and he didn't want you to be blindsided.
Castle : But you couldn't let that happen.
Castle : Not to Modesto and certainly not to you.
Castle : So you had him silenced.
Elise : You think I killed my ex-husband?
Elise : Detective, I had nothing to do with Richie's death.
Elise : And by the way, there is no defect or cover-up.
Castle : Richie knew otherwise.
Castle : In fact, he committed a break-in just to prove it.
Ryan : We found that a silent alarm was tripped
Beckett : at a Modesto Motors storage facility three nights ago.
Beckett : But when police responded, they were told it was set off by mistake.
Castle : Yet an ambulance was called there that night
Castle : to treat a guard for chloroform inhalation.
Elise : I'm not familiar with that incident.
Beckett : Well, are you familiar with this?
