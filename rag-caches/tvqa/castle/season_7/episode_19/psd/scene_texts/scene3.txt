UNK: Take the law by the tail and get a bite at the settlement you deserve.
UNK: I'll fight for you, the little guy.
UNK: Because Pitbulls and underdogs stick together.
UNK: Remember, I'll make the law your bitch!
UNK: Well, Richie's clients may be suffering,
UNK: but his business sure wasn't.
Beckett : Yeah, well, there's always gonna be
Beckett : people looking for a quick settlement
Beckett : and plenty of opportunistic bottom-feeders like Richie
Beckett : ready to help them cash in.
Castle : Bet half these people are faking.
Castle : See that guy over there? Mmm-hmm.
Castle : Watch this.
UNK: Excuse me, sir? Could you throw this away for me?
Castle : Sorry, my aim is a little...
UNK: Maybe... He's probably legit.
UNK: Annie Klein : Sorry for the wait, folks. I'm sure Pitbull will be here any minute.
Annie : The way he's been acting the last few days,
Annie : I knew something was wrong.
Beckett : How was he acting?
Annie : Anxious, paranoid.
Annie : Before he'd leave the office, he'd look out the window.
Annie : It's like he thought someone might be watching him.
Annie : And yesterday morning, he called to say that he wasn't coming in at all.
Castle : Was that unusual?
Annie : He never missed a day in the three years I worked for him.
UNK: Do you know what was going on?
Annie : He wouldn't talk about it.
Annie : I asked if it had something to do
Annie : with one of the cases, and he...
Annie : He said no, and he, uh, told me not to worry,
Annie : and that it would all be over soon.
Castle : Was he having problems with anyone?
UNK: Uh, clients, a girlfriend?
Annie : He didn't have a girlfriend.
UNK: I kept hoping, but...
Annie : Look, I...
Annie : I know what you guys are thinking.
Annie : Personal injury lawyers are gutter rats, right?
Annie : But Richie was different. He really cared.
