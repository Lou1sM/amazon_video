Alexis : Okay. I think my brain is crammed to the limit.
Beckett : Well, I think you and your brain are more than ready.
UNK: Richard Castle : Hey, Alexis. Don't you have a mid-term this morning?
Alexis : I'm leaving now.
Alexis : Beckett was just giving me a last-minute review.
UNK: Bye-bye. Bye.
Alexis : Thanks for your help. Yeah.
Castle : Bye. Good luck.
Beckett : You know, she's got an amazing brain.
UNK: I mean, if she wanted to, she'd make an incredible lawyer.
Castle : Yeah, like I don't lose enough arguments to her already.
Castle : What about you? You ever regret it? Not getting your law degree?
Beckett : Um, I'd rather take criminals down than send them up.
UNK: Really? Mmm-hmm.
Castle : Because with your mind, I bet you could have made Chief Justice.
