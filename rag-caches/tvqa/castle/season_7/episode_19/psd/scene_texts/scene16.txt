Beckett : Since when do you turn down a challenge?
Castle : Oh, they know we're better. No sense in embarrassing them.
Beckett : You know, don't you?
Beckett : Know what?
Beckett : That's why we got pulled from the lineup.
Beckett : Kimmel's your bud.
Beckett : You must have called him and told him to perform so we wouldn't have to.
Beckett : Or, so that I wouldn't have to.
UNK: I may have overheard you talking to my mother.
Beckett : You did that for me?
Castle : No more of a sacrifice than what you were gonna do for me.
Castle : Kate, why wouldn't you just say something?
Beckett : I didn't want you to think less of me,
Beckett : and I really didn't want anyone else to know, so...
UNK: Stupid.
Castle : No, not stupid. Just human.
Beckett : Aren't you disappointed
UNK: you're not gonna be able to perform for an audience?
UNK: The only audience I care about is you.
UNK: Oh.
