Elise : from a Modesto storage facility,
Elise : then it is the property of Modesto and we'd like it back.

Beckett : Especially considering
Beckett : it could cost your company hundreds of millions of dollars.
Beckett : Which is why you hired this man to retrieve it.
Beckett : We're looking into his financial records right now.
Beckett : It's only a matter of time before we connect him to Modesto.
Elise : You're barking up the wrong tree, Detective.
Elise : Modesto has its own in-house investigators.
Elise : If we wanted to recover this dummy, as you claim,
Elise : why would we entrust such a sensitive task to an outsider?
Elise : But I have seen this man before.
UNK: Where? In front of Saint Simon's Hospital.
Elise : He was sitting in a car, conferring with someone else.
Beckett : Conferring with whom?
Archie : Owed a cash settlement?
Archie : It's Hammer time!
Archie : I'll pound and pound away
UNK: till I've nailed down the cash you've got coming.
Archie : Anyone gets in your way, they'll have to deal with me,
Annie : the Savannah Hammer.
Castle : Is that what happened to Richie Falco?
Castle : He got in your way, so you pounded him till he was dead?
