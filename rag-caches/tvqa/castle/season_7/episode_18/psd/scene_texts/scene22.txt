Castle : Carolyn Decker's blocking Lopez.
Ryan : That would explain why the assassin missed Lopez.
Beckett : Unless he didn't miss him.
UNK: Exactly. Carolyn Decker
Esposito : was almost square to the shooter.
Esposito : And she's the one who got hit center-mass.
Beckett : You guys, what if we're looking at this the wrong way?
Castle : And Carolyn Decker was the real target.
Frank : All right, we'll dig through her life,
Ryan : see if anyone had motive to do this.
Tory : There's something you should see first.
Tory : This is from Eric Chambers' building.
Tory : I was reviewing it to piece together his timeline
Tory : when I saw this.
Tory : He goes straight to Chambers' mailbox.
Castle : Okay, that is definitely not the mailman.
Beckett : He must be leaving the press pass for Chambers. When was this?
Tory : Three hours before the shooting.
UNK: And can we get a look at this dude's face?
Tory : Not a good one.
Ryan : Oh, my God.
Beckett : What is it?
UNK: It's my brother-in-law. That's Frank.
