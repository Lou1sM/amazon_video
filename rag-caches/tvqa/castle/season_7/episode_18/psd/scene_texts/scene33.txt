UNK: Frank!
Beckett : Ryan, I'm so sorry.
Beckett : I know.
UNK: It's gonna be a lot harder on my sister.
Ryan : But at least Frank isn't our shooter.
Castle : Does he know who is?
UNK: No. He received $5,000 and an envelope
Ryan : along with an address where to leave the press pass.
Beckett : And who paid him?
Ryan : He was contacted by an outfit called Manhattan Politics.
Ryan : Turns out, it's a front, with a dead email address.
Castle : So whoever's behind this set up Eric Chambers
Castle : and used Frank to do it.
Beckett : Can we trace the money?
Ryan : No luck so far. Though the bills are sequential,
Ryan : so it probably came from a bank withdrawal.
Castle : What about the envelope?
Ryan : CSU pulled off a partial print,
Ryan : but it's not enough to run against the database.
Beckett : Maybe we don't have to.
Esposito : What do you mean?
Castle : Well, given the texts we found on Carolyn Decker's phone,
Castle : we may only have to check one name.
Mia : Alex will be discharged later today
Mia : and we are so grateful and humbled
Mia : by the outpouring of support from all over the world.
Mia : But it's also a time of mourning
