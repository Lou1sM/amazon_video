Esposito : And I bet that Chambers will help us out and roll on Shelton.
Ryan : Why hasn't he done that already?
Esposito : Maybe Shelton made Chambers some promises
Esposito : in return for him keeping his mouth shut.
Ryan : Why would a man in Shelton's situation risk being seen with Chambers?
Esposito : Because he's like all these other rich sons of bitches
Esposito : who think they can get away with anything.
Ryan : I don't know.
Ryan : Something about this just isn't sitting right, Javi.
Esposito : You're spinning. You just need a good night's sleep.
Esposito : In the morning, everything will be clear to you.
