UNK: Uh, truth is, I'm not allowed to say.
Esposito : What do you mean you're not allowed to say?
Esposito : It's us. Who is it?
Ryan : Seriously, man. I can't.
Castle : That means this goes beyond the usual pro-athlete or reality star.
Castle : This is someone important. Someone revered.
UNK: Perhaps the Pope?
Castle : The Dalai Lama?
Castle : Angela Merkel?
Ryan : My lips are sealed.
Castle : Ryan! Is it One Direction? You'd tell me, right?
Castle : Are they in town?
Esposito : No, they're in Hong Kong.
UNK: Right.
Ryan : Hey, how's my sister doing?
UNK: Frank Kelly : Sleeping easier now that I retired from the force.
Ryan : You don't miss the job at all? Working Vice?
Frank : Nah. I was dealing with lowlifes every waking minute.
Frank : Now I'm my own boss.
UNK: Yeah.
Frank : I'm telling you, Kev, security is a better way of life.
Ryan : I have to say, a lot of guys, when they retire, they just drift.
Ryan : But you're really making this work.
Frank : You could make it work for you, too.
Frank : Anyhow, there's a permanent spot for you with me
Frank : the minute you make the call.
Ryan : Wow, Frank.
Ryan : That's a hell of an offer.
Frank : With your background, I'd be lucky to have you.
Frank : Now tell me, did you memorize the rogues' gallery?
Ryan : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every face.
Ryan : So, what's the threat level here? Low.
Frank : It's a charity event for Pure Water Now.
UNK: It's not a Middle-East peace conference.
UNK: There's gonna be protesters who
UNK: wanna bother Congressman Lopez.
Frank : You've heard of him, right?
Ryan : Yeah, yeah. Who hasn't?
