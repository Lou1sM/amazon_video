Beckett : And her calendar shows
Beckett : that she was completely dedicated to Pure Water Now.
Beckett : She has that handwritten letter
Beckett : from a little boy in Africa in her wallet,
Beckett : thanking her.
Beckett : His village was almost completely wiped out by cholera,
Beckett : and then once they set up the water filtration system in the village,
Beckett : nobody died.
Beckett : She was actually making a difference.
UNK: Megan Brooks : You know, you make a difference, too.
Beckett : Yeah, not like her.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: What?
Beckett : She's got a second phone.
Castle : Anything on it?
Beckett : Yeah. Motive for murder.
UNK: What did you do, Frank?
Frank : Not what you're thinking, man.
Ryan : It's a nice touch,
UNK: the way you acted all surprised when I remembered
UNK: that Chambers was wearing a press pass.
UNK: But you weren't surprised, Frank,
Ryan : because all along it was you that gave it to him.
Ryan : You hired me for this job
Ryan : because you knew that I would never suspect you.
