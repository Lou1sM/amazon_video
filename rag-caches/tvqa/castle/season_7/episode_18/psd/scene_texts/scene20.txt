Ryan : and I'll keep you safe.
Ryan : If not, I can't help you.
Ryan : Nobody can.
Ryan : Just think about it.
Ryan : Um, but don't think too long.
UNK: Wait.
Beckett : So, if Chambers isn't our shooter,
Beckett : then what was he doing backstage?
Ryan : He wanted to make a political statement by confronting Lopez
Ryan : during his speech in front of the cameras.
Ryan : That way, he knew that it would blow up on the 24-hour news cycle.
Frank : All right, what about Carl Shelton?
Ryan : Castle, it's looking like Shelton may not be involved.
Castle : The billionaire industrialist
Castle : with his grubby hands on the levers of power?
Castle : Of course he's involved. They were seen in the storage room.
Ryan : That's because Shelton realized
Gates : that Chambers had crashed the event.
Ryan : So, he tried to talk him out of making a scene.
Beckett : So, where did Chambers get the press pass from?
UNK: It was left for him in his mailbox.
UNK: In his mail box?
Castle : By whom?
Ryan : An anonymous sympathizer contacted him through his website,
Ryan : left him the pass and instructions about where to wait backstage.
UNK: Okay, yeah. Okay. Can I... Can I just say
Castle : I know I have occasionally theorized that a conspiracy was afoot...
UNK: Occasionally?
