Ryan : That Frank killed Carolyn Decker? Why would he?
Gates : I don't know, but we need to consider the possibility.
Gates : At the very least, he was involved.
Gates : So we're bringing him in.
UNK: Good.
Ryan : Because you know what? He'll tell his side of the story.
Ryan : There's an explanation for this.
Castle : I'm sure there is, Ryan, and nothing would make us happier.
UNK: Guys, this is my brother-in-law.
Ryan : There's no way he could be mixed up in something like this.
Esposito : Hey, bro.
Esposito : I'm sorry to say that, uh, unis just tried to pick up Frank.
Esposito : As soon as he saw the patrol car, he bolted. They lost him.
Gates : Issue an APB.
Gates : See if there's any connection between
Gates : Frank Kelly and Carolyn Decker.
Beckett : I'm on it.
UNK: Uh, where are you going?
UNK: I'm gonna go find Frank.
Esposito : I'll go with you.
Ryan : Thanks, Javi.
Ryan : But this is family here. I gotta do this one alone.
UNK: Okay.
