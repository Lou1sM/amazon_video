Castle : But this time a conspiracy really is afoot!
Castle : Guys, Chambers was clearly being manipulated
Castle : by a person or persons unknown into being backstage,
Castle : so he'd be the perfect patsy.
Beckett : Why would someone go to all that trouble
Beckett : to set him up as Lopez's shooter?
Esposito : I may have an answer for that.
Esposito : Prelim ballistics report.
Esposito : You were right. The shots did not come
Esposito : from where Chambers was standing.
Beckett : So where did the shots come from?
Esposito : Well, based on trajectories,
Castle : the shots were fired from this position right here.
Ryan : The shooter was behind the lighting stanchion.
Beckett : That's why no one saw him.
Beckett : He took his shot and then he slipped out the back.
UNK: Yeah, it's good concealment.
UNK: Nobody would be able to spot him. But check out this angle.
