UNK: Congressman, did you notice anything
Beckett : or anyone suspicious prior to the shooting?
Lopez : Everything seemed normal.
Lopez : Until it wasn't.
Beckett : Well, we believe that the shots originated
Beckett : from the north end of the backstage area.
Castle : That's the direction you were facing
Castle : when you were speaking with Carolyn Decker.
Beckett : Did you notice anyone in the background?
UNK: I saw stagehands,
Lopez : production crew...
Lopez : There was this one guy.
Castle : What was he wearing?
UNK: A gray suit.
Lopez : Is that him?
Lopez : Is that the man that killed Carolyn?
Beckett : Did you see his face? Can you describe him?
Lopez : I can most definitely describe him.
Esposito : This is our guy. Eric Chambers.
UNK: A fringe blogger and political activist
Esposito : with some pretty extreme ideas.
Beckett : Okay, he looks like the sketch,
Beckett : but can we place him at the crime scene?
Esposito : CSU pulled Chambers' prints off the wall.
Esposito : So, he was there. It's definitely him.
Castle : I'm guessing he's not a big supporter of Lopez.
Esposito : That's an understatement.
Esposito : Two weeks ago, Chambers ranted on his blog
Esposito : about how Lopez posed a threat to the American way of life,
Esposito : and that he would get what all traitors deserve.
