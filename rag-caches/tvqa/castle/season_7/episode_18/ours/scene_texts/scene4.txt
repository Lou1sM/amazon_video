UNK: Kevin Ryan : - Hey. - Hey, how's Lopez?
UNK: Lucky.
UNK: The round hit his collarbone, but missed his heart.
Ryan : How about Carolyn Decker?
Frank : Still in surgery.
Ryan : I took my eyes off them for one second...
UNK: No, no, no, no, Kev. We're gonna find this shooter.
UNK: NYPD sealed off 10 square blocks from this place.
Ryan : Did we get a description?
Frank : Only the one you gave us. Six feet, medium build, brown hair.
Ryan : Come on, no one saw his face?
Frank : Yeah, they did, but they were too busy panicking to remember.
Frank : Look, why don't we walk through what happened?
Ryan : No, Frank, I already did that.
Frank : And what's the harm in doing it again?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Okay.
Ryan : Shots rang out.
Ryan : Three of them.
UNK: I... I dove onto Lopez. Took Carolyn down, too.
UNK: I saw they were hit. That's when you came in.
UNK: All right. And then I spotted the shooter.
UNK: I only ever saw the back.
Frank : All right, think about his hands. Rings on his fingers, a watch.
UNK: No, no, no, nothing like that.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Wait. Uh...
Ryan : Blue card.
Ryan : Yeah, he had a pale blue ID card hanging from his neck.
Ryan : This guy had a press pass.
Frank : Kev, that's good.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: I'm gonna brief NYPD.
UNK: Okay.
Ryan : Bad news travels fast.
Beckett : Are you okay?
UNK: Nah, not really.
Ryan : Can we talk later?
Beckett : Uh, no. Kev, this can't wait.
Ryan : Beckett, I have to work this case.
Beckett : Look, it's a homicide now.
Beckett : I'm at the hospital. Carolyn Decker just died in surgery.
Beckett : Kev? Are you there?
Ryan : Yeah. I'm here.
Beckett : I read your statement. We should talk about it.
Ryan : No, no. There's no point.
Ryan : I never saw the shooter's face.
Ryan : But, hey, have you talked to Lopez yet?
Beckett : No. Why?
Ryan : The shooter was in his line of sight.
Ryan : If anyone saw him, it was Lopez.
Beckett : Okay. I'm on it. I'll call you as soon as I know something.
Ryan : I'm sorry, sir. Um, this area is off limits.
UNK: Mr. Decker : Carolyn is my daughter.
Ryan : I'm very sorry, sir.
UNK: Mr. Decker : All she ever tried to do was help people.
UNK: Mr. Decker : Why her?
UNK: Kev.
UNK: Yeah. Any luck on that press pass? Who'd it belong to?
Ryan : No one.
UNK: What do you mean "no one"?
Frank : Event security kept extra passes
Frank : on hold for last-minute attendees.
UNK: So somehow our shooter got a hold of one.
Ryan : Damn it.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : So, how's Ryan doing? He knows it's not his fault, right?
UNK: Well, it happened on his watch.
Beckett : So, for Ryan, it means it's all on him until he finds this guy.
UNK: Jim Boyce : Detective Beckett, Jim Boyce, State Party Chair.
UNK: Jim Boyce : This whole thing is just terrible.
UNK: Jim Boyce : Is there any news?
Beckett : Just that we're doing everything we can to apprehend the suspect.
Boyce : Well, I'm glad that you're the one handling the case.
Beckett : I'm sorry, Mr. Boyce, do we know each other?
Boyce : No, but you have an outstanding reputation
Boyce : and it's gotten the attention of the people in my world.
Boyce : I won't hold you, Detective. Pleasure to meet you.
Beckett : Yeah, likewise.
Castle : What was that about?
