Mia : by the outpouring of support from all over the world.
Mia : But it's also a time of mourning
Mia : for the tragic death of Carolyn Decker.
Mia : My husband will honor her name by continuing to fight
Mia : for the people of this country
Mia : and for those whose voices aren't always heard.
Boyce : Thank you.
Frank : Excuse me.
Mia : Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. What brings you here?
UNK: This.
Beckett : It contained cash used to buy a press pass for Eric Chambers.
Mia : A press pass? That's how the assassin got in?
Castle : Well, you should know. Your fingerprint is on the envelope.
Beckett : Where were you during the shooting, Mrs. Lopez?
Beckett : Because we can't account for you.
Mia : You can't be suggesting that I tried to kill my husband.
Castle : Oh, no. No, no. Not at all.
Castle : We're suggesting you tried to kill Carolyn Decker and succeeded.
Mia : That's ridiculous and despicable.
Beckett : These are texts between your husband and Carolyn.
Castle : Going back three years,
Castle : when their affair first started.
Beckett : That's motive for murder, Mrs. Lopez.
Castle : Now, maybe it was purely personal
Castle : or maybe you saw her as a liability
Castle : to your husband's chances of becoming president.
