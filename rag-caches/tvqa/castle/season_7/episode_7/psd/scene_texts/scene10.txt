Beckett : But the problem is, his identity is a mystery.
Ryan : Well, speaking of mysteries, we spoke with Whitney's friends.
Ryan : They said prior to her departure,
Ryan : she was spending a good deal of time at the Historical Society.
Beckett : Do they know what she was doing there?
Ryan : Well, we're still looking into it, but...
Beckett : Okay, guys. I gotta go.
UNK: Hey, Kate. Wait, are you going to hog-tying class?
UNK: Mmm, yeah. Me, too!
Tobias : Oh, my God, we're gonna have so much fun!
Beckett : Yeah, we sure are. Hog-tying.
UNK: Yee-haw.
Castle : No ring.
Castle : One down.
UNK: What'll it be, feller?
UNK: I'll take, uh, coffin varnish.
Bartender : Some what?
UNK: You know, a gut warmer, base burner, nose paint, cowboy cocktail.
UNK: What do y'all call whiskey here?
UNK: Whiskey.
UNK: Ooh.
Marshall : Hey, mister. I sure could use your help.
Marshall : I'm looking for the Peacock boys.
Castle : Well, I haven't seen them, Marshal. But I'll, uh, keep an eye out.
UNK: You just gonna bat your eyes, mister, or are you gonna play?
UNK: Oh, yeah! Hey, I'm a sporting man. Here we go.
Castle : Hey there, partner. Couldn't help
Castle : but notice you got a ring on your finger.
Castle : Just had mine put on. Newlywed.
Ollie : This isn't a ring. It's a noose.
Castle : That bad, huh? Ooh.
Castle : Yeah, I suppose, one woman for the rest of your life is a tall order.
Castle : What's your secret? You'll figure it out.
UNK: Oh, come on. What, do you got a little left-handed missus on the side?
Ollie : I don't cheat on my wife, friend.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Well, that's, uh, not what I heard.
UNK: You no-good, mangy cur. You got an ace up your sleeve!
Dealer : You know what we do with card cheats in here, mister?
UNK: Daisy May : Hold it, boys.
UNK: Daisy May : Hear them bells? It's high noon. That means it's show time.
UNK: Daisy May : Take it out back. Time for a good old-fashioned gun fight!
UNK: Yee-haw!
Ollie : What do you know? Huh? My wife send you?
Castle : Hey, I've never met your wife!
Ollie : Who told you I was a cheater?
Castle : Whitney did.
Ollie : Damn it!
Ollie : I knew it! Look, everything that woman said to you was a lie.
UNK: Daisy May : Ollie! What in tarnation! Mister, are you okay?
Castle : You thought that was real?
UNK: Yes! Ollie, up high!
UNK: He... You asked him to throw you out?
Castle : Yeah. Like, Old West style.
Castle : - Ollie's been... - He's all, "Yeehaw," and...
UNK: Well, all righty, then. As long as you're enjoying yourself.
UNK: Damn!
UNK: That could've cost me my job. Look, mister, I'm sorry.
Castle : Save it. You want my silence? Tell me about Whitney.
Castle : What happened between you two?
Ollie : Look, she came on to me. Started flirting, getting all handsy.
Ollie : A bunch of the boys saw us and figured we hooked up.
Ollie : But we didn't, I swear it.
Ollie : In fact, I think she was just after my ranch key.
Ollie : Ranch key?
UNK: It's on a snake key chain.
Ollie : I think she picked it off me when she was pawing at me.
Castle : What does the key open?
Ollie : The ranch shed.
UNK: I mean, you're saying that she stole your key
Castle : to open the ranch shed? What's in the shed?
UNK: Nothing. Just ranch supplies.
Castle : I don't get it. Why would Whitney steal a key to this place?
Beckett : I don't know, but clearly it has nothing to do with the affair.
Castle : Right, so what was she after?
Beckett : Castle, do you remember how Lanie said
UNK: that she found traces of wax-covered cardboard
Esposito : under Whitney's nails and in her waistband?
