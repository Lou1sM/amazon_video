Sheriff : No, it's personal.
Sheriff : Look, I've got people here. Folks I grew up with.
Sheriff : And I can't just go in and disrupt business.
Sheriff : Until there's some concrete proof.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : I'm sorry.
UNK: Without the sheriff's cooperation,
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : there's only so much we can do.
UNK: So, we're just gonna let him get away with this?
Esposito : Kind of like how we let you get away
Esposito : with not inviting us to the wedding?
Gates : Well, at least you were invited to the champagne toast.
Beckett : Sorry, sir.
Gates : Oh, no, no, no. I'm sure it was Mr. Castle's fault.
Gates : Now, regarding the case,
Gates : I'll call the feds and see if they can intercede on our behalf.
Beckett : Sir, that could take weeks.
Beckett : By then, any evidence or witnesses could be long gone.
Ryan : Uh, excuse me, sir. I checked Whitney's financials.
Ryan : She used a car service to get to
Ryan : the airport in Arizona this morning.
Ryan : And I spoke with the driver.
Ryan : He said she seemed upset when she left the ranch.
Esposito : Something happened there.
UNK: Yeah, but we have no way to investigate it.
UNK: Wait.
Alexis : Maybe we do.
Alexis : We do?
Castle : Well, look at this place.
Castle : I mean, it's got beautiful skies, wide open spaces.
Castle : Thrill of the Old West?
Castle : What better place for an impromptu honeymoon?
Castle : For the investigation, of course.
Castle : We could jump on a plane and be there in a few hours.
Beckett : Castle, you cannot be serious.
Castle : We can find Whitney's killer
Castle : and have a honeymoon at the same time. It's perfect.
Beckett : No, Castle, we are not having a honeymoon at a dude ranch!
Castle : Well, then, it can be our cover story.
Castle : We're a newlywed couple with a hankering for the wild frontier, right?
Castle : And, look, Beckett,
UNK: I know you wanna see justice brought to this young woman's killer,
UNK: and this... This is the only way.
