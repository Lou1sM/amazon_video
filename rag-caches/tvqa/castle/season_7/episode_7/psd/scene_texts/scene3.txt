UNK: for an 8 : 00 a.m. flight out of Phoenix this morning.
Ryan : This morning?
Beckett : So, she was poisoned in Arizona.
Beckett : Somewhere between 1 : 00 and 5 : 00 a.m. local time.
Esposito : And all indications are that she left in a big hurry.
Esposito : She even forgot to turn in her bunkhouse key.
Beckett : Okay, I need every detail we can get on that place.
Castle : According to this,
UNK: "Diamondback Old West Ranch is a living-history resort,
UNK: "where both staff and guests dress in Old West attire
UNK: "and engage in cowboy activities." This sounds pretty cool!
Beckett : Or not, considering Whitney might've been poisoned there.
Beckett : Wait a minute.
Beckett : If Whitney flew back today,
Beckett : then she was coming in on the train from JFK
Beckett : when she had that seizure.
Beckett : But the only personal effect that
Beckett : we found at the hospital was her purse.
Beckett : So, where's her luggage?
UNK: Maybe it was left in the subway when the medics took her.
UNK: Well, if something happened at that ranch,
UNK: then there might be evidence of it in her suitcases.
Esposito : I'll look into it.
Ryan : And I'll keep digging in her financials.
Ryan : Maybe there's somewhere else she went in Arizona.
Beckett : And I'll touch base with the local sheriff
Beckett : and coordinate with him on the investigation.
Ryan : Thanks, big boy.
Sheriff : Look, Detective, the way I see it, this is not an Arizona matter.
UNK: Sheriff, we have evidence that Whitney
Beckett : was poisoned in your jurisdiction.
UNK: No, what you have is speculation.
UNK: She could've been poisoned on the plane, or at the airport.
Sheriff : Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.
Beckett : Well, I'm telling you where to begin. Diamondback Old West Ranch.
UNK: Detective, you gotta understand.
Sheriff : That resort is the lifeblood of our little tourist town.
Beckett : So, this is political?
