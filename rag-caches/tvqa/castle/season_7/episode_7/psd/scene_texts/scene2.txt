UNK: No. No, I'm afraid not.
UNK: Okay, "Diamondback."
UNK: I have whittled it down to three possibilities as to what that means
Castle : and why Whitney would utter it with her dying breath.
Beckett : And I am sure that none of them will be a waste of my time.
UNK: Possibility number one,
UNK: it's the password for a murderous
UNK: underground snake-handling fight club.
UNK: Granted, that's probably not what it means,
UNK: but it might be the basis for my next Nikki Heat novel.
UNK: Possibility number two, she was killed
UNK: by the Marvel character, Diamondback,
UNK: whose special skill was throwing diamond-shaped spikes
UNK: filled with poison.
Castle : Third possibility...
UNK: It's a dude ranch in Arizona.
Ryan : We struck out with the Dagmars,
Ryan : but we found an e-mail to Whitney
UNK: from a "Diamondback Old West Ranch,"
UNK: confirming a two-week stay in bunkhouse number 14.
Castle : Old West dude ranch. That's my number three.
UNK: It's exactly what I was gonna say. Good work, boys.
Esposito : You still suck.
Ryan : And you owe us for those tuxedo rentals.
UNK: Right.
Beckett : So, she was on vacation in Arizona? For two weeks?
UNK: Yep.
Beckett : She go with anyone?
UNK: No, but it looks like the whole city-slickers-cowboy thing
Ryan : didn't really agree with her.
Ryan : Whitney cut her trip short after only three days there.
Ryan : She paid for a last-minute ticket change
