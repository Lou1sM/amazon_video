Castle : So, she left it there, she went back to New York for help.
Castle : But perhaps the killer caught onto her,
Castle : poisoned her to silence her and to keep the gold for themselves.
UNK: When Whitney went home, she was upset.
Beckett : Does that sound like someone who just found gold?
UNK: Okay. Hmm, you got me there.
Castle : But if Whitney was searching for the gold
Castle : and the killer tracked her, there could be clues.
UNK: You keep assuming that the gold's still out there.
Beckett : Don't forget, Clyde and Dutch were looking for it.
Beckett : They might have found it.
Castle : Not if they didn't have those old maps that Whitney had.
UNK: You just wanna go after the gold.
UNK: Of course I wanna go after the gold! It's gold!
Castle : Okay, look.
Castle : If we use Whitney's research,
Castle : we may find Whitney's killer, too.
Castle : Come on, Beckett. What do you say?
