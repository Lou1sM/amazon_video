Castle : Oh, she's on an ATV.
Castle : She probably can't hear her phone. What's up?
Ryan : There was a third partner. He's the killer.
UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : The sheriff?
Ryan : No, it's James Grady.
Grady : Well, I guess this is goodbye.
Castle : Grady, stop!
UNK: Who's gonna make me, son? You?
Castle : Look, Grady, you, uh... You kill me,
Castle : that's just another murder you're gonna have to answer for.
Grady : Not if I make it to Mexico first.
Castle : I can't let that happen.
Grady : You've got sand, boy, I'll give you that much.
