Beckett : Yeah, so?
UNK: So, you know what's wrapped in wax-covered cardboard?
UNK: Dynamite.
Beckett : She broke in here to steal sticks of these.
Castle : Ranchers use dynamite to clear their land.
Castle : What the hell was Whitney using it for?
Ryan : Is there any indication why Whitney would steal dynamite?
Beckett : Not yet, but Castle and I have been
UNK: re-tracing every move she made,
UNK: starting with that horseback-riding tour that she snuck away from.
UNK: Well, any idea where she was going?
Beckett : I asked around,
Beckett : and apparently, the trail that she took
Beckett : led to the Native American reservation.
Esposito : Wait a minute. It wasn't the Yavapai Reservation, was it?
Beckett : Yeah. How'd you know?
Ryan : The Historical Society.
Ryan : Whitney was looking up obscure documents and maps
Ryan : from the late 18th, early 19th century.
Esposito : Yeah, most of them had to do
Esposito : with the construction of a dam near the Yavapai Reservation.
Beckett : Well, did anyone know why she was researching that area?
Esposito : No, but it's probably the reason
Esposito : she went out there in the first place.
Ryan : But it doesn't explain why Whitney needed dynamite,
Ryan : or why she was poisoned.
UNK: Look, it's all gotta be related.
Beckett : Castle and I are headed up to the
Beckett : reservation to get some answers now.
