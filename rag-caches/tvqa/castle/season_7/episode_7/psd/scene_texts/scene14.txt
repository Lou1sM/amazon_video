UNK: Relax.
Castle : He got me. Welcome.
UNK: Whew!
Castle : Well, I'm Rick. Yes.
Castle : This here is Kate. And we are on our honeymoon.
Castle : - Ain't we, honey? - Yeah, we sure are.
Beckett : So, we met a guest at Diamondback. Her name was Whitney.
Beckett : She said that she came out here
Beckett : and she discovered some breathtaking views.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : Yeah, sure. I remember Whitney. Nice girl.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : She came out a few days ago riding an Appaloosa.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : But she wasn't interested in the scenery.
Castle : Really? What was she, uh, interested in?
Beckett : Did it have anything to do with dynamite?
UNK: Yavapai Elder : Dynamite? No, she just had a question about a Yavapai word.
Castle : What word was that?
UNK: Aha gah hel'lah. She wanted to know if it could be misinterpreted.
Castle : Seems an odd question. Not really.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : Many of our words change depending on the context.
UNK: "Aha gah hel'lah" means "river."
UNK: Yavapai Elder : But sometimes it means "stream."
Beckett : Why would she want to know about that word?
Doctor : I have no idea.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : But Whitney was happy with my answer.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : She thanked me and left.
Castle : And that was it? I don't get it.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : Well, I don't get newlyweds dressing
UNK: Yavapai Elder : up like cowboys on their honeymoon.
UNK: Yavapai Elder : But I try not to judge.
Castle : You know, the more we learn about Whitney,
Castle : the less I understand about what she was up to.
Beckett : Yeah. I mean, the Historical Society,
Beckett : the Yavapai word, the dynamite.
Beckett : How does all of that add up to someone poisoning Whitney?
