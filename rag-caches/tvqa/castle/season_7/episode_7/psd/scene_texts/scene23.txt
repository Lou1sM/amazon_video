Beckett : Or Clyde found the gold and split it with his buddy Dutch,
Beckett : and simply abandoned Whitney and her mom.
Castle : I'm absolutely positive Clyde didn't find the gold.
Beckett : And how can you be so sure, huh?
Castle : Because it's still here.
Castle : For over a century, 50 ingots of pure gold
Castle : have been trapped in this cold, dark tomb,
Castle : waiting patiently to be rescued.
Castle : You hear that, Beckett?
Castle : You hear them calling?
