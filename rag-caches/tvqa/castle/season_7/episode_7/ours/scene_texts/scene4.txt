Beckett : Yeah, we sure are. Hog-tying.
UNK: Yee-haw.
Castle : No ring.
Castle : One down.
UNK: What'll it be, feller?
UNK: I'll take, uh, coffin varnish.
Bartender : Some what?
UNK: You know, a gut warmer, base burner, nose paint, cowboy cocktail.
UNK: What do y'all call whiskey here?
UNK: Whiskey.
UNK: Ooh.
Marshall : Hey, mister. I sure could use your help.
Marshall : I'm looking for the Peacock boys.
Castle : Well, I haven't seen them, Marshal. But I'll, uh, keep an eye out.

UNK: Oh, yeah! Hey, I'm a sporting man. Here we go.
Castle : Hey there, partner. Couldn't help

Castle : Yeah, I suppose, one woman for the rest of your life is a tall order.
Castle : What's your secret? You'll figure it out.
UNK: Oh, come on. What, do you got a little left-handed missus on the side?
Ollie : I don't cheat on my wife, friend.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Well, that's, uh, not what I heard.
UNK: You no-good, mangy cur. You got an ace up your sleeve!

Castle : Hey, I've never met your wife!
Ollie : Who told you I was a cheater?
Castle : Whitney did.
Ollie : Damn it!
