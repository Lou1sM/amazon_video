Castle : I think.
UNK: Maybe.
Beckett : I don't know.
Beckett : Castle, what are you doing?
Castle : I am tracking Whitney's path to the gold.
UNK: And how are you doing that?
Castle : By staring at the dirt.
Castle : That's how they do it in all the old Westerns.
Beckett : Yes, because they're cowboys. You're a New Yorker.
Beckett : An Easterner. A city slicker.
Castle : Yes, and because I'm a city slicker,
Castle : I can tell you with absolute certainty, Whitney was here.
Beckett : How? You don't know how to read tracks.
Castle : No! No. But because I'm a New Yorker, I know how to read litter.
Castle : Check this out.
UNK: Charred, wax-covered cardboard.
UNK: Whitney must've detonated the dynamite nearby.
Ryan : We're close.
UNK: Ah.
Castle : More there.
UNK: Beckett, look at this!
UNK: There's gold in them thar hills.
Castle : You go first, check for snakes.
Castle : This place is old.
UNK: This mine must've been abandoned
Castle : before the Peacock boys stashed their loot.
