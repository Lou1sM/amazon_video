Beckett : Slow down, Castle. Just be careful.
Castle : Are you kidding? There's treasure in here.
Castle : Whitney found the gold.
Beckett : Or Clyde found the gold and split it with his buddy Dutch,
Beckett : and simply abandoned Whitney and her mom.
Castle : I'm absolutely positive Clyde didn't find the gold.
Beckett : And how can you be so sure, huh?
Castle : Because it's still here.
Castle : For over a century, 50 ingots of pure gold
Castle : have been trapped in this cold, dark tomb,
Castle : waiting patiently to be rescued.
Castle : You hear that, Beckett?
Castle : You hear them calling?
Castle : Calling to me.
Castle : Your wait is over, my golden friends. I'm here to save you.
Castle : Okay, that's not gold!
UNK: That's blunt-force trauma.
UNK: Yeah, and given this hat, I'm pretty sure I know who the victim is.
Beckett : It's Clyde. Yep.
Beckett : Castle, do you think that Whitney came out here to find her dad?
UNK: Well, explains why she was so upset when she left.
Castle : You were right. Clyde found the treasure years ago.
