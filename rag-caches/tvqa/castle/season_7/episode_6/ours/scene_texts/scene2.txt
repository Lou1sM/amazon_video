Castle : Guys! Hey, guys! Beckett's in trouble.
Castle : I got away, but her car is missing. I think she was abducted.
Castle : Uh, Captain?
Castle : You're okay! You made it back!
Ryan : Captain Beckett, this guy claims you're in trouble.
UNK: "Captain"? You know him?
Beckett : I've never seen this man before in my life.
Castle : Never seen me before? Okay, that's very funny.
Castle : I'm just glad you're okay. How did you get back here?
Beckett : Excuse me?
Castle : From the power plant. We were being shot at.
UNK: That's a nice suit, by the way.
Beckett : Whoever you are, I think you'd better leave.
UNK: - Whoever I am? Ow! - Come on, pal.
Esposito : Whatever trip you're on, if you leave quietly,
Esposito : I'm sure we can forget this ever happened.
UNK: Okay! Whoa! I get it.
Castle : You guys are punking me.
Castle : Sorry. Just like, uh, my birthday. This is good.
Castle : How did you stage that?
UNK: The double shooting, the severed hand,
UNK: coal dust on the shirt?
Esposito : He just described our crime scene.
Beckett : Where did you get that information?
Castle : From being at the crime scene
Castle : with all of you.
Ryan : Captain, we only got the forensics
Ryan : about the coal dust five minutes ago.
Beckett : And how do you know so much about this case?
Castle : Kate, okay, you know what? You got me. Joke's over.
UNK: You're right. It is.
UNK: No...
Castle : Guys, seriously, what's going on here?
Ryan : Mr. Richard Castle. Ha, you're a novelist.
Ryan : Why don't you tell us the story about where you were
UNK: between 4 : 00 and 6 : 00 a.m.?
Castle : In bed with Beckett.
Esposito : Maybe you shouldn't talk about the captain like that.
Ryan : How did you know about that coal dust?
UNK: Well, that's where all this started, at the plant.
Castle : There was...
UNK: There was an explosion.
UNK: I must've gotten knocked out. This is a dream, okay?
UNK: You guys are just creations of my psyche.
UNK: This is me just working out some issues.
UNK: That's why you don't know me.
UNK: Because you aren't real.
UNK: And you know what? I can prove it.
UNK: Well-known fact,
UNK: it's impossible to read in a dream. Hey!
UNK: "Richard Castle, AKA Richard Rodgers."
Esposito : You had me worried there.
UNK: For a second I thought I didn't exist.
Castle : Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
Castle : It says here I jumped on a Macy's Parade float
UNK: and sang Let It Go with Idina Menzel,
Castle : and then landed a hot air balloon naked in Central Park.
Castle : I didn't do these things, guys.
Castle : Come on. I would never sing Let It Go as a duet.
UNK: Mr. Castle, this is gonna go much easier for you
Ryan : if you just tell us what you know about those murders.
UNK: Okay, Kate? Kate!
Ryan : This guy's nuts. Come on!
Castle : Please, just talk to me?
Esposito : Sit down, or I'll have to restrain you.
Castle : I know you're in there. Because usually I'm right beside you.
Beckett : Mr. Castle, sit down.
Beckett : I'll handle this.
Esposito : You sure, Captain? Mmm-hmm.
Ryan : Mr. Castle, let's just say for a moment
Beckett : that you and I did meet each other.
Beckett : Where would that have been?
Castle : At my book party.
Castle : You came to me.
Castle : You asked me to consult on a copycat murder.
Castle : It was six years ago. Your hair was short then.
Castle : It was adorable.
Beckett : Six years ago, huh?
Beckett : Well, it says here that you met with a Detective McNulty.
Beckett : Apparently, you helped him solve the case.
Ryan : No... No, no, no. Kate, it was you.
UNK: All... I can't...
Castle : I woke up next to you this morning. I'm not imagining that.
Renzo : I, uh... I'm sorry, Mr. Castle.
Beckett : We don't have a relationship.
Beckett : Before today, you and I have never met.
Beckett : Now, is there someone that you would like to call?
Martha : Who should I make this out to?
UNK: Uh, Kevin, Mrs. Rodgers. Uh-huh.
UNK: All right, Kevin.
Ryan : Your Mama Rose in Gypsy? Perfection.
UNK: Ah, thank you. You are a dear, sweet boy.
UNK: Well...
