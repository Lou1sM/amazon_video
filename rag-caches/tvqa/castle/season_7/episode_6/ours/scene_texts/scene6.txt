Esposito : Why, writer boy?
Esposito : What, you think you have a chance with her?
Esposito : And what are you doing,
UNK: telling crazy over here about everyone's private life?
UNK: Me?
Esposito : Yeah. You told him about Lanie and me.
Ryan : No, no, no, I didn't.
UNK: I'm telling you. Listen to me!
Castle : I have a gift, all right?
Castle : I look at people and I see things.
UNK: Yeah? Okay.
UNK: Uh, what do you see when you look at me?
Castle : Honey milk and freckles.
UNK: No!
Ryan : That's Jenny O'Malley.
UNK: Yeah, she used to make me honey milk.
UNK: She could have been the one.
UNK: "Could have"? Yeah.
UNK: Um, well, when Beckett was promoted to captain,
UNK: our caseload doubled.
UNK: Well, I guess I never had time for her.
Esposito : Maybe you should give her a call.
Esposito : Maybe you should mind your own business.
UNK: Oh!
Esposito : All right, here are the rules.
Esposito : Stay in the car or I shoot you.
Esposito : Got it?
UNK: You wanna crack a window for me?
Esposito : I can't believe the captain's making us babysit this nut job.
Ryan : Oh, he's not so bad.
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Take me home.
Castle : Come on.
UNK: Maria Sanchez : Hand it over or you die.
Maria : Who sent you? What do you know?
Castle : Nobody sent me. Nobody, uh...
UNK: This, it sent me.
Castle : The object, it sent me.
Castle : I saw a blue light, and I ended up here.
Ryan : NYPD! Drop your knife, now!
UNK: No!
Ryan : What the hell, man? You were supposed to wait in the car.
Castle : What does it matter now? It's broken.
Castle : Now I'm never getting home. I'm stuck here in this life.
Castle : But the real one would never break.
Castle : This is a fake! This is a fake.
Castle : Where did you get this? And where's the real one?
Esposito : Cuff him, too.
Ryan : What the hell do you think you were doing?
UNK: You could've gotten yourself killed.
Castle : I had backup. And I did help capture a suspect.
Beckett : No, you were supposed to accompany and observe,
Beckett : not participate and... Annoy.
Beckett : Risk my people's lives.
Beckett : Now, after this morning's antics,
Beckett : I expected you to be on your best behavior.
Castle : Actually, that kind of is my best behavior.
UNK: What?
Esposito : Oh, I'm just enjoying the show.
