Alexis : Now I think I understand it.
Castle : What do you mean?
Alexis : I had all these plans, you know?

Alexis : But this non-profit I'm working for,
Alexis : everything we do seems so small and pointless.
Alexis : It's like nothing I do matters, so why try?
Castle : Sweetie, no, um...

Castle : Every moment, every decision you make,
Castle : it affects the people around you,
Castle : it changes the world in a million imperceptible ways.
Castle : No matter what your reality, you can make it better.
Castle : We both can.
Alexis : I've missed you, Dad.
UNK: Ah, darling, where are you off to?

Castle : She's better off with me, and I'm better off with her.
Castle : Even in this world.
Castle : If I can prove to this Beckett how extraordinary she is,
Castle : she can help me find that artifact.
Castle : And I can get back home. Ah.
Cashier : There you go. That's a large cappuccino for Rick,
Cashier : and a large skinny latte, two pumps sugar-free vanilla, for Kate.
UNK: Right? Awesome. Perfect!
Castle : Thank you very much.
