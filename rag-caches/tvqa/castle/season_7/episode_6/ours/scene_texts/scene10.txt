UNK: Taxi!
Jack : That's okay. I'll give you a ride.
Castle : I hate this world.
Castle : Hey, take it easy.
Lawyer : That's him.
Castle : Marcus Lark, Lark Development.
Castle : So you're behind this.
UNK: Marcus Lark : What do you know about this, Mr. Castle?
Castle : I know you killed two men for it.
Lark : Oh, you know more than that.
Lark : My attorney overheard you at the police station,
Lark : so I had him check up on you.
Lark : Pretty strange behavior the last two days.
UNK: Which means either you're psychotic,
Lark : or this isn't your world.
Ryan : I have no idea what you're talking about.
Lark : I think you do.
Lark : Do you know how many years I spent looking for this?
Lark : Hearing the whispered secrets,
Lark : ancient alien technology,
UNK: naturally-occurring quantum anomalies, the power of God.
Lark : I spent years untangling legend from truth.
Lark : The Incans believed it was a gateway to the gods,
Lark : but it's not.
Lark : It's a doorway to the infinite.
Lark : A chance to change my destiny.
Lark : I know everything about this, Mr. Castle.
Lark : Except how it works.
Castle : You're rich, successful.
Castle : You have everything.
Castle : Why would you wanna change your destiny?
Lark : No man lives without regrets.
Lark : Now then, Mr. Castle,
Lark : how does it work?
UNK: Richard Castle : I don't know.
Castle : I was holding on to it, and it just happened.
UNK: Look, I don't wanna hurt you.
Lark : But I will if you don't tell me how it works.
Castle : I swear to you, I don't know.
Lark : Shoot out his knee. What?
UNK: NYPD! Drop your weapon, now!
Castle : Regret this!
Beckett : Are you okay? Yeah.
Castle : How'd you find me?
Beckett : I couldn't stop thinking about what you said, about compromise.
Beckett : So I decided to retrace the investigation.
Beckett : It's just pure luck that it brought me here when it did.
Castle : Or fate.
Beckett : Why are you here? What did they want from you?
Castle : Something I guess I didn't have.
Castle : Look out!
Beckett : Oh, God!
Ryan : Mr. Castle, you saved my life.
UNK: Why?
Castle : Because I love you, Kate.
Ryan : Mr. Castle.
Beckett : No, please don't go. Stay with me.
Beckett : Stay with me. Castle. Castle?
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Castle?
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Beckett?
Castle : It's you! Yeah.
UNK: My you! I'm back!
Castle : I'm back!
Castle : And I'm not dead.
Castle : What happened? You hit your head?
Castle : No. How long was I gone?
UNK: Richard Castle : I don't know. We got separated.
Beckett : Ryan and Esposito got here just in time with backup.
UNK: Hey, Castle, you missed all the excitement.
Ryan : We were awesome. Weren't we, Javi?
Esposito : As usual.
UNK: Lark?
Beckett : It looks like he was behind the theft.
Beckett : Although none of them are talking.
Beckett : You know, the one thing that we haven't been able to find
Beckett : is the object that was in the briefcase.
