UNK: Look, the DA is gonna ask for a plea deal.
Beckett : But trust me, this suspect's ex-military, he's not gonna roll.
Castle : So that's it?
Beckett : This isn't one of your books, Mr. Castle.
UNK: We don't always get the answers.
Beckett : We cleared the case. It's a win.
Castle : No, you know, that can't be it.
Castle : The Kate Beckett in my world would never call this a win.
Castle : The Kate Beckett where I come from,
Castle : she would be unrelenting in the face of anything that's thrown in her path.
Castle : She would find the truth.
Castle : And she would never compromise.
UNK: I don't know what twilight-zone world you think you come from,
Beckett : but you don't know me. And don't pretend you do.
UNK: Goodbye, Mr. Castle.
Beckett : We're done here.
UNK: Hey!
Castle : You're still up?
Alexis : Still on LA time.
