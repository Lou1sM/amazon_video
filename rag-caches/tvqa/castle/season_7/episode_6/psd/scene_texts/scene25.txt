UNK: Ah, darling, where are you off to?
UNK: I'm gonna take my own advice.
Castle : I know why the universe sent me to this world.
Castle : So, the most important day of our lives got screwed up.
Castle : Big deal.
Castle : She's better off with me, and I'm better off with her.
Castle : Even in this world.
Castle : If I can prove to this Beckett how extraordinary she is,
Castle : she can help me find that artifact.
Castle : And I can get back home. Ah.
Cashier : There you go. That's a large cappuccino for Rick,
Cashier : and a large skinny latte, two pumps sugar-free vanilla, for Kate.
UNK: Right? Awesome. Perfect!
Castle : Thank you very much.
UNK: Taxi!
Jack : That's okay. I'll give you a ride.
Castle : I hate this world.
Castle : Hey, take it easy.
Lawyer : That's him.
Castle : Marcus Lark, Lark Development.
Castle : So you're behind this.
UNK: Marcus Lark : What do you know about this, Mr. Castle?
Castle : I know you killed two men for it.
Lark : Oh, you know more than that.
Lark : My attorney overheard you at the police station,
Lark : so I had him check up on you.
Lark : Pretty strange behavior the last two days.
UNK: Which means either you're psychotic,
Lark : or this isn't your world.
Ryan : I have no idea what you're talking about.
Lark : I think you do.
Lark : Do you know how many years I spent looking for this?
Lark : Hearing the whispered secrets,
Lark : ancient alien technology,
UNK: naturally-occurring quantum anomalies, the power of God.
Lark : I spent years untangling legend from truth.
