Castle : You were married to your work.
UNK: A lot like when you were when I met you.
Beckett : And how were you without me? Did you win the Pulitzer?
UNK: Uh, I was still waiting to hear.
UNK: But I admit that my life was nowhere near as wonderful without you.
Beckett : That's quite a dream.

Castle : is the one where I made it to our wedding.
Beckett : Me, too.
Beckett : Yeah, I know.
