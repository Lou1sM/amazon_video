Lark : how does it work?
UNK: Richard Castle : I don't know.
Castle : I was holding on to it, and it just happened.
UNK: Look, I don't wanna hurt you.
Lark : But I will if you don't tell me how it works.
Castle : I swear to you, I don't know.
Lark : Shoot out his knee. What?
UNK: NYPD! Drop your weapon, now!
Castle : Regret this!
Beckett : Are you okay? Yeah.
Castle : How'd you find me?
Beckett : I couldn't stop thinking about what you said, about compromise.
Beckett : So I decided to retrace the investigation.
Beckett : It's just pure luck that it brought me here when it did.
Castle : Or fate.
Beckett : Why are you here? What did they want from you?
Castle : Something I guess I didn't have.
