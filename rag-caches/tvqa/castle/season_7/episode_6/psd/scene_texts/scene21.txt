UNK: Truthfully, I don't think that I was meant to be a homicide detective.
Castle : Why would you say that?
Beckett : Because the case that made me wanna be a cop,
Beckett : I was never able to solve.
Beckett : Anyway, back to you.
Beckett : Why did you kill off Derrick Storm?
UNK: Ah.
Castle : It's complicated.
Beckett : Wait. What is this place? I thought this was a date.
Castle : Okay, hang on. Hear me out.
Beckett : You're still working the case?
Castle : Listen, the crimson rhino is the mascot for an Australian rugby team.
Castle : If our suspect has it tattooed on his neck,
UNK: he's gotta be a major fan.
Castle : I looked it up.
Castle : There's only one bar in New York that plays their games live.
Castle : And there's one on right now.
Beckett : I knew this was a mistake.
Castle : Beckett, wait.
Beckett : It's him.
Beckett : Stay here.
UNK: Excuse me. NYPD.
Beckett : Step away from the bar
Beckett : and put your hands where I can see 'em.
UNK: Tattooed Man : Sure thing. Hey!
Castle : We make a pretty good team, you and I.
UNK: Well? What did he say?
Beckett : Nothing, on the advice of his high-powered counsel.
Castle : Okay, so what's our next move?
Beckett : There is no next move.
Beckett : You asked to stick around until this case was resolved.
Beckett : It's resolved. How is it resolved?
Beckett : Detectives Ryan and Esposito found the G-Wagen
Beckett : and the murder weapons at our suspect's place.
UNK: This is open-and-shut.
Castle : What about the artifact? We need to find it.
Beckett : Whoever had them steal it, it and they are long gone by now.
Castle : Someone has to know where it is.
Castle : There's the other shooter.
Beckett : Okay. But we have no way to find him.
