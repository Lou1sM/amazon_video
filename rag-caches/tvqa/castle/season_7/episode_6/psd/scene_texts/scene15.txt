Castle : Come on.
UNK: Maria Sanchez : Hand it over or you die.
Maria : Who sent you? What do you know?
Castle : Nobody sent me. Nobody, uh...
UNK: This, it sent me.
Castle : The object, it sent me.
Castle : I saw a blue light, and I ended up here.
Ryan : NYPD! Drop your knife, now!
UNK: No!
Ryan : What the hell, man? You were supposed to wait in the car.
Castle : What does it matter now? It's broken.
Castle : Now I'm never getting home. I'm stuck here in this life.
Castle : But the real one would never break.
Castle : This is a fake! This is a fake.
Castle : Where did you get this? And where's the real one?
Esposito : Cuff him, too.
Ryan : What the hell do you think you were doing?
UNK: You could've gotten yourself killed.
Castle : I had backup. And I did help capture a suspect.
Beckett : No, you were supposed to accompany and observe,
Beckett : not participate and... Annoy.
Beckett : Risk my people's lives.
Beckett : Now, after this morning's antics,
Beckett : I expected you to be on your best behavior.
Castle : Actually, that kind of is my best behavior.
UNK: What?
Esposito : Oh, I'm just enjoying the show.
Esposito : Our suspect's name is Maria Sanchez.
Esposito : She's wanted by the Peruvian government
Esposito : in connection with the bombings at a government building,
Esposito : not to mention the theft and trafficking of stolen artifacts.
Castle : Then that's her. And she's behind it.
Castle : We need to talk to her.
Beckett : No, Mr. Castle. They need to talk to her.
Beckett : You need to go home.
Beckett : You're done with this case. But...
Beckett : You're lucky I don't arrest you for obstruction.
Beckett : Officer, please escort Mr. Castle to the elevator.
UNK: I want him gone.
Castle : You don't understand. I need to find this artifact.
Castle : Beckett, please!
Beckett : Yes, Detective Esposito?
Esposito : You're not letting him get to you, are you?
Beckett : Don't you have a case to close?
UNK: Mmm.
