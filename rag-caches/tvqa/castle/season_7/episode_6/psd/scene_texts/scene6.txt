UNK: and sang Let It Go with Idina Menzel,
Castle : and then landed a hot air balloon naked in Central Park.
Castle : I didn't do these things, guys.
Castle : Come on. I would never sing Let It Go as a duet.
UNK: Mr. Castle, this is gonna go much easier for you
Ryan : if you just tell us what you know about those murders.
UNK: Okay, Kate? Kate!
Ryan : This guy's nuts. Come on!
Castle : Please, just talk to me?
Esposito : Sit down, or I'll have to restrain you.
Castle : I know you're in there. Because usually I'm right beside you.
Beckett : Mr. Castle, sit down.
Beckett : I'll handle this.
Esposito : You sure, Captain? Mmm-hmm.
Ryan : Mr. Castle, let's just say for a moment
Beckett : that you and I did meet each other.
Beckett : Where would that have been?
Castle : At my book party.
Castle : You came to me.
Castle : You asked me to consult on a copycat murder.
Castle : It was six years ago. Your hair was short then.
Castle : It was adorable.
Beckett : Six years ago, huh?
Beckett : Well, it says here that you met with a Detective McNulty.
