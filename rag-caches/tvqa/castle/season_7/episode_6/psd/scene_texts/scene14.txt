UNK: Who was he calling? I have no idea, but check it out.
UNK: The deserted restaurant, El Chozo,
Ryan : maybe that's where he was headed.
Ryan : It's right near where the SUV was attacked.
Beckett : All right. Get up there, see what you can find.
Castle : Uh, Captain, would it be possible for me to ride along?
UNK: Uh, strictly for research purposes.
Esposito : Is he kidding?
Castle : I would just love the chance to observe,
Castle : get some details for my book.
Ryan : Yeah, sure, Cap. We'll take him along. What the...
UNK: Dude, that's Martha Rodgers' son. He can get us house seats.
Ryan : You can get us house seats, right?
UNK: Absolutely.
Beckett : Okay. But do as they say, and don't interfere.
Castle : Come on. Let's go, house seats.
Castle : So, the captain... Is she seeing anyone?
Ryan : She has boyfriends. None of them serious.
Esposito : Why, writer boy?
Esposito : What, you think you have a chance with her?
Esposito : And what are you doing,
UNK: telling crazy over here about everyone's private life?
UNK: Me?
Esposito : Yeah. You told him about Lanie and me.
Ryan : No, no, no, I didn't.
UNK: I'm telling you. Listen to me!
Castle : I have a gift, all right?
Castle : I look at people and I see things.
UNK: Yeah? Okay.
UNK: Uh, what do you see when you look at me?
Castle : Honey milk and freckles.
UNK: No!
Ryan : That's Jenny O'Malley.
UNK: Yeah, she used to make me honey milk.
UNK: She could have been the one.
UNK: "Could have"? Yeah.
UNK: Um, well, when Beckett was promoted to captain,
UNK: our caseload doubled.
UNK: Well, I guess I never had time for her.
Esposito : Maybe you should give her a call.
Esposito : Maybe you should mind your own business.
UNK: Oh!
Esposito : All right, here are the rules.
Esposito : Stay in the car or I shoot you.
Esposito : Got it?
UNK: You wanna crack a window for me?
Esposito : I can't believe the captain's making us babysit this nut job.
Ryan : Oh, he's not so bad.
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Take me home.
