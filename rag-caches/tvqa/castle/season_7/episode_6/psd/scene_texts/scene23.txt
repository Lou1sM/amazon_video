Alexis : So, did you find your mystic meteor?
Castle : No. No, um...
Castle : Trail went cold.
Alexis : Guess you're stuck here with us then.
UNK: Come, come sit with me.
Castle : Come on, just give me a chance. Just, um...
Castle : For old times' sake.
Castle : I have a question for you,
Castle : and I would love a non-ironic answer.
UNK: What happened between us? Why did you move to LA?
Alexis : You know why. Uh...
Castle : Tell me again.
Alexis : Because you gave up.
Alexis : You read all those terrible reviews on your magnum opus
Alexis : and you couldn't move past it,
Alexis : and I couldn't stick around and watch.
Alexis : But you know what?
Alexis : Now I think I understand it.
Castle : What do you mean?
Alexis : I had all these plans, you know?
Alexis : To change the world.
Alexis : But this non-profit I'm working for,
Alexis : everything we do seems so small and pointless.
Alexis : It's like nothing I do matters, so why try?
Castle : Sweetie, no, um...
Castle : Everything you do matters.
