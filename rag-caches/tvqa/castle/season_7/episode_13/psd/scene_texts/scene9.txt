Beckett : And when did the affair begin?
Taylor : About a week later.
UNK: What?
Taylor : He's hot. And rich.
Beckett : What time did he come to your apartment last night?

UNK: he showed up right around 6 : 00, and he left just after 8 : 00.
Beckett : So, the two of you were in the apartment the whole time?
UNK: Yep.
