Beckett : So, you staged the attack on Eva in her house?
Robert : Yes, so that PI would see it, and the trail would lead straight to Cole.
Robert : It was all for show, of course.
Robert : Cole gets arrested, Eva gets his money and disappears.
Beckett : So how did Eva end up dead?
Ryan : I don't know.
Robert : I spoke to her the next morning.
Robert : Eva was stressed out. Regretful.
