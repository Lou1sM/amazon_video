Castle : Eva's blood.
Neely : I'm Detective Neely. Do you have a few minutes to talk?
Cole : Yeah. Come on in.
Cole : So, what is this all about?
Cole : What can I do for you folks?
Neely : Mr. Whitfield, is your wife Eva home?
Cole : No. Why?
Neely : Do you know where she is?
Cole : No, I don't. I got home about 20 minutes ago.
Cole : Found this lovely note from Eva.
Cole : She figured out I'm having an affair and she left me.
Castle : She left him? I can't believe this guy. He forged that note.
Cole : I can't even get in touch with her.
Cole : I tried calling her, and I tried calling her,
Cole : the phone just goes straight to voicemail.
Beckett : Do you drive a black Model S?
Cole : No, that's...
UNK: No, that's, uh, Eva's car.
Cole : Has something happened to Eva?
Neely : We're not quite sure.
Neely : But you're saying you only got home 20 minutes ago?
UNK: Yeah, right, uh, around 9 : 30.
Castle : And where were you at 7 : 45 tonight?
UNK: I was, um... I was still in the city. I was at work.
UNK: You know what? I think I need a refill. Excuse me.
Castle : He's lying. He's lying about everything.
Neely : If you're right, there should be blood evidence in the kitchen.
Castle : It was here. It happened right here. He must have cleaned it up.
Castle : Why else would he invite us so freely into his house?
Neely : If he did, he did a hell of a good job of it. UV shows no sign of residue.
UNK: Castle...
Castle : Kate, I know what I saw.
Castle : There! There! See? I knew it!
Cole : Knew what? What is going on?
Neely : Sir, there's blood residue here.
Beckett : Mr. Whitfield, do you know where this came from?
UNK: Yes.
Cole : My wife is a klutz.
UNK: She broke a jar and cut her hand cleaning it up.
Cole : Bled everywhere until she finally bandaged it.
UNK: Why? Why are you looking for blood residue?
UNK: Are you suggesting that I did something to my wife?
Castle : No, we're not suggesting, Mr. Whitfield.
Cole : Get out. Get out of my house.
Cole : Get out, now!
