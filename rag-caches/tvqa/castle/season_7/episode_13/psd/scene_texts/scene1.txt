Beckett : 'Cause if you're going to your office, then I'm going to mine.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Knock 'em dead, babe.
UNK: Hey.
Eva : Well, hello there.
Castle : You must be Mrs. Whitfield. I'm Richard Castle.
Castle : Ooh, ouch! What happened there?
Eva : Just cut myself.
UNK: Richard.
Eva : Really? Come on, Richard Rodgers, you really don't remember me?
Eva : Faircroft Prep, AP Chem. I used to cheat off of you.
UNK: Eva? Eva Hendricks!
Eva : Eva, yeah.
Eva : Well, I'm Eva Whitfield now.
UNK: Oh, yeah, I'm Richard Castle now.
Eva : I know.
UNK: I've read your books and followed your adventures with the NYPD.
Eva : I heard you were a PI. So, well, I, uh...
Castle : Uh, why don't we go inside and talk?
Castle : So, Eva, tell me, what can I do for you?
UNK: Um, it's my husband, Cole.
Castle : What about him?
Eva : He's a stockbroker.
UNK: He's, um... He's bright, he's handsome, charming.
Eva : We got married and it was so wonderful.
UNK: Um, but then, in the last few years,
Eva : it's gotten so difficult.
Castle : I'm sorry.
UNK: Rick, I think he's cheating on me.
Castle : And what makes you think that?
Eva : The way he acts, um,
Eva : the hours he keeps.
UNK: I mean, I should've known it was coming. He insisted on a prenup.
Eva : I just... I have to find out the truth.
Eva : Can you help me?
