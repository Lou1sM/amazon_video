Beckett : So, her husband was having an affair,
Beckett : and you caught him cheating?
Castle : Caught him red-handed and bare-bottomed.
Beckett : Oh, poor Eva. Well, how's she taking it?
Castle : Not well. I spent the last half hour
Castle : on the phone with her. Lots of crying.
Castle : She's packing up now to leave him.
UNK: She just wants me to drop these pictures by first.
Beckett : Wait, tonight?
Castle : She wants to see first-hand that her marriage is over.
Castle : What am I going to tell her? No?
Beckett : Just don't let her cry on your shoulder too long.
Castle : Beckett, remind me never to take this kind of case again.
Beckett : Look, you're the one who said
UNK: that you're gonna have to pay your dues as a PI.
Castle : Yeah, that was before I knew what it meant.
Beckett : Would it help at all if I cooked you dinner tonight?
UNK: Immeasurably.
Beckett : Okay, what time can you make it home?
UNK: Uh, Westchester and back?
Castle : Factoring in time for shoulder crying, 8 : 30, 9 : 00?
Beckett : I'll see you then. I love you.
UNK: It's like you're not even trying. Would you just... Hey.
UNK: Hey. What's going on with Castle's case?
UNK: No, don't try to change the subject.
Esposito : I'm not talking about this anymore, bro.
Beckett : What are you not talking about?
Esposito : Ryan is all up on my back because
Esposito : I'm not dating anyone right now.
Ryan : Tell her why. Okay, so...
UNK: Look, a while ago, we buy this couples' weekend ski trip.
UNK: And it's next month.
Beckett : Oh, except Lanie and Espo have broken up
Beckett : yet again. Yeah. Yeah.
Beckett : What? You guys have. Come on.
Esposito : Yeah, but that's no reason for him and Jenny to think
Esposito : I can't find anyone else to take. I mean, come on.
Esposito : I have no problem getting girls.
UNK: But that's the thing, you don't have to get one.
UNK: Jenny and I already have... We have a friend...
Esposito : Wait. Are you talking about a blind date? Oh, hell no!
Beckett : Espo, just hear him out.
Ryan : Her name is Stacy. She's fantastic.
Ryan : She runs a music store. She's into sports.
Ryan : And we told her all about you.
Ryan : - She wants to meet. - Hmm.
Ryan : Take a look at her picture.
Esposito : Come on, man.
UNK: Hey...
Esposito : She's all right.
UNK: "She's all right"?
Beckett : Espo, she's stunning. And you won't even meet with her.
Esposito : Okay, maybe I will.
Esposito : But only because she's so excited to meet me.
Esposito : And you know I don't like to disappoint the ladies.
Beckett : Nice. Good job.
Eva : Thank you.
Castle : Oh, my God!
Castle : Hey! Hey, stop!
UNK: Hey, you're on your way home?
Castle : Beckett, he killed her!
UNK: Castle...
Castle : He killed her. He...
