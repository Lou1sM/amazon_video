Castle : You know, we were surprised to learn
Beckett : that Cole's first wife, Mallory,
Beckett : was a sorority sister of yours in college.
Beckett : And you were devastated by her death.
Aubrey : We all were.
Beckett : Yeah, but you were the one that told
Beckett : friends that he got away with murder.
Beckett : So why, after all of these years,
Beckett : would you leave a top-level law firm
Beckett : to join Cole's company?
Castle : Here's a theory.
Castle : You took the job to insinuate yourself into Cole's life,
Castle : searching for the right way,
Castle : the right moment to get revenge for Mallory.
Castle : And you found it with Eva.
