Castle : But you couldn't have that. Not after
Castle : all those years, after all that planning.
Castle : So you decided that Eva's fake murder

Castle : And killing Cole was just
Castle : a way of tying up loose ends.
UNK: Wow.
Aubrey : That's an exciting story, Mr. Castle.

Beckett : We found Eva's blood and DNA in the trunk of your car.
Beckett : It's over, Ms. Haskins.
Castle : I doubt it.
Neely : Well, we'll take it from here. Again, thanks for everything.

UNK: Yeah. I'm really sorry.
UNK: Yeah, I know you are, bro.
Esposito : In fact, you're so sorry that you're gonna

Ryan : Yeah, that's only fair.
UNK: Cool, 'cause I got a date.
UNK: Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! With Stacy?
UNK: Nah, nah, I wasn't feeling her.
