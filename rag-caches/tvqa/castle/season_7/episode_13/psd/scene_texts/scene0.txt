UNK: Richard Castle : What are you doing to my desk?
UNK: Kate Beckett : Oh. Uh, well, Gates is on vacation.
UNK: Kate Beckett : So, I figured, why not do my paperwork from home with my husband?
UNK: Kate Beckett : That is, if you want to play hooky with me.
Castle : Is it technically playing hooky if we're working?
Beckett : Well, we could work for a bit, and then, maybe, take a nap.
UNK: Ooh.
Castle : I like naps.
Beckett : Yeah, naps are good.
Castle : Hang on. Oh.
Castle : It's a call forwarded from the PI office.
Castle : Richard Castle Investigations.
UNK: Speaking.
UNK: Yes.
Castle : No. Great! I will see you in 20 minutes.
UNK: All right, bye.
Castle : Well, for once in the relationship, I'm the one getting the call.
Castle : I have a potential client.
Beckett : Castle, that's fantastic!
UNK: No, it's not. No. I was gonna spend the day with you.
Beckett : It's fine. It's not like I don't leave at a moment's notice
Beckett : when there's a homicide.
UNK: Well, then, maybe if I'm done soon,
UNK: I'll swing by later for, you know, a nap.
Beckett : If you do, you'll be napping alone.
