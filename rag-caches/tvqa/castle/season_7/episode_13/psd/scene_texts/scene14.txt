Castle : Beckett, are you still awake?
UNK: No.
Castle : Good. Something's bothering me.
Beckett : Yeah? Something's bothering me, too.
Castle : Why would a guy like Cole commit suicide?
Beckett : Because a guy like Cole didn't think he could face going to prison.
Castle : As wealthy and connected as he was?
UNK: Would he even have gone to prison?
Castle : The case against him was circumstantial.
Castle : He could have beaten it in court.
Beckett : Well, evidently, he didn't think so.
Castle : It's too clean.
Beckett : Castle, stop chasing the mice in your head.
UNK: What if they're leading me to the truth?
Beckett : Then we'll deal with it in the morning. Mmm.
UNK: Castle?
Beckett : Hey, I brought you some coffee on my way to...
UNK: Wow.
Beckett : You definitely don't need any more coffee. Hey.
Cole : What is this?
UNK: Uh, timeline. Eva is red, Cole is green, and Taylor is blue.
Beckett : A timeline for a case that's closed?
Castle : Not yet. Cole didn't kill himself.
Beckett : Based on what?
Castle : Based on his personality.
Castle : Cole is cocky, he's entitled,
UNK: and he's far too much of a narcissist to commit suicide.
Castle : So, if he didn't kill himself, that means he was murdered.
UNK: Castle, that's a pretty big "if."
Castle : It changes everything.
Castle : Because if Cole didn't kill himself,
Castle : it follows that he didn't murder Eva.
Castle : Someone else did.
Castle : That's why it was staged to look like a suicide.
Castle : So the police would conclude that he was the guilty party.
Beckett : Then whoever killed Cole also killed Eva.
Beckett : And who would that be?
Castle : The man I saw attacking her.
Castle : Whoever hit me in the woods.
Beckett : Who you said was Cole.
Castle : He wanted me to believe he was Cole. It was just all theater.
