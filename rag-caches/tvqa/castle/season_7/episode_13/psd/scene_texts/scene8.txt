Castle : Have you heard from Detective Neely?
Beckett : She said that search teams didn't find anything in the woods.
Castle : Yeah. That's because Cole knew he couldn't leave her out there,
UNK: not once I was onto him.
Castle : So he put her back in the car,
Castle : dumped it and the body someplace else.
UNK: Westchester has got a BOLO out on Eva's car.
Beckett : And they've flagged her credit cards.
Castle : Have they pinged her cell phone?
Beckett : They tried. But it's either off or dead.
UNK: Yeah, I wanna go with dead.
Castle : What about his alibi?
Beckett : Well, he wasn't at work like he said.
Beckett : His business partner said that he left at 6 : 00 p.m., not at 8 : 00.
UNK: Plenty of time to get back to Westchester by 7 : 45.
Beckett : But when Detective Neely confronted
Beckett : him about it, he revised his story.
UNK: He said that he was with his mistress,
Beckett : Taylor McKinley, that woman that you took pictures of,
UNK: until 8 : 00 p.m.
Castle : We need to talk to her.
Beckett : Castle, I don't have any jurisdiction. This isn't my case.
Castle : Yes, but it's my case.
Castle : Eva hired me.
Castle : She was my friend,
Castle : and he killed her right in front of me.
UNK: Okay. I'll talk to the mistress.
Beckett : But just me.
Beckett : Not you. You're too close to this. Okay?
UNK: Taylor Mckinley : So? We had an affair and his wife left.
UNK: Taylor Mckinley : What's the big deal? That stuff happens every day.
Beckett : Except wives don't go missing every day.
Taylor : It's a little soon to say she's missing, isn't it?
Taylor : I'm sure she'll be back.
UNK: Um, Ms. McKinley, how long have you known Mr. Whitfield?
