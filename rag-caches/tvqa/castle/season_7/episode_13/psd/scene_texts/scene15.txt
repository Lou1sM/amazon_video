Beckett : Okay, Castle, let's say for a second
Beckett : that someone snuck into the house
Beckett : disguised as Cole and attacked Eva.
Beckett : How could they possibly know that
UNK: you were gonna be there to witness it?
Castle : Well, he had to have been in on it with Eva.
UNK: If Eva is a part of the setup, then why is she in the morgue?
UNK: Because, in classic Hitchcock fashion,
Castle : her co-conspirator double-crossed her.
UNK: "The Articles of Incorporation for Whitfield and Galloway."
Beckett : Cole's company?
Castle : It took me two boxes of Cronuts to get
Castle : that out of the County Clerk's office.
Castle : See, Cole and his partner Scott Galloway
Castle : were in business together.
Castle : But in that document, it says if anything happens to one of them,
Castle : the other one gains control of the company.
Beckett : You're suggesting that Scott Galloway was Eva's co-conspirator.
Castle : I listened to the recording I made of their lunch.
Scott : This could be a serious payday.
UNK: Please, it's chump change, Scott.
UNK: Now, don't be glib, Cole.
Castle : They were getting a major offer to buy out their firm,
Castle : an offer that Cole was against.
Castle : So I did a credit check on Scott Galloway.
Castle : He was in massive debt.
Castle : A buyout would've fixed all that.
Castle : But in order for that to happen,
Castle : he needed control of the company.
Castle : Eva wanted out of her marriage and she wanted Cole punished.
