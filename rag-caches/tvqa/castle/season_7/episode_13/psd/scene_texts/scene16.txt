Castle : So they teamed up to take Cole out of the picture.
UNK: Castle, there is no evidence that supports this.
Castle : It was Scott Galloway. It has to be.
UNK: Beckett, would you please just check Scott's alibi?
Castle : Would you do that for me?
Beckett : I will. But listen to me.
Beckett : Eva was your friend.
Beckett : She came here, to this very office, and asked for your help.
Beckett : And now she's dead and you feel responsible.
Beckett : And that can make you see ghosts.
Ryan : Wait. We're looking into Scott Galloway now? Why?
Esposito : I thought everything pointed to
UNK: Cole Whitfield being our killer?
Beckett : It does.
Ryan : You believe this theory of Castle's?
Beckett : I believe that he's been right too many times not to consider it.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Hey, I was just about to call you.
UNK: Listen, I've been thinking about it.
Castle : And with the benefit of hindsight, uh, you're right.
Castle : I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole.
Castle : Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.
Beckett : No, he doesn't. His alibi checks out.
Beckett : But you were right, Castle. We found proof that Cole didn't kill Eva.
