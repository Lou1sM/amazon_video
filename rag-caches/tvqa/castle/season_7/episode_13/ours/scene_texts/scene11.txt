UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Hey, I was just about to call you.
UNK: Listen, I've been thinking about it.
Castle : And with the benefit of hindsight, uh, you're right.
Castle : I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole.
Castle : Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.
Beckett : No, he doesn't. His alibi checks out.
Beckett : But you were right, Castle. We found proof that Cole didn't kill Eva.
Beckett : And I know who did.
UNK: Scott Galloway is in the clear.
UNK: At 7 : 45, when Eva was supposedly attacked,
UNK: he was at his son's basketball game.
UNK: But you said you had proof that Cole didn't kill Eva. What is it?
UNK: Your theory about Scott didn't pan out, but we did due diligence,
Esposito : looked at other people in Cole's life.
UNK: And that's when we found this.
Castle : - Is that Cole's SUV? - It is.
Beckett : Street cams show that Cole was in this house,
Beckett : which is in Scarsdale, from 6 : 00 to 8 : 00 p.m.
Ryan : Therefore Cole Whitfield could not have
Ryan : been the man that you saw attack Eva.
UNK: And here's another fun fact.
UNK: Cole visited that house on a regular
UNK: basis between 6 : 00 and 8 : 00 p.m.
Castle : Whose house is that?
Beckett : Robert James.
Beckett : One of the other executives at Whitfield and Galloway.
Castle : He was at the lunch. But what was Cole doing
Castle : at Robert James' house?
Ryan : Well, he wasn't there to see Robert James.
Ryan : Turns out, he always worked late at the office.
Ryan : But Mrs. James was there.
Castle : Are you kidding?
Castle : Cole was having a second affair with his colleague's wife?
Beckett : Which is probably why he lied about where he was that night.
Esposito : The wife confirmed the affair,
Esposito : but she thought that nobody knew about it.
Castle : Can we put Robert James near the Whitfield house that night?
Esposito : Damn right, we can.
Beckett : Mr. James, uh, thank you so much for coming in.
Robert : Of course. Though, I'm not quite sure how I can help you.
Beckett : Well, you can start by telling me where
Beckett : you were two nights ago at 8 : 00 p.m.
Robert : Well, I work late. I was at the office.
UNK: No, you weren't.
UNK: In fact, this is you at a tollbooth at 7 : 04 p.m.,
UNK: heading to Cole's house in Westchester.
UNK: There is no need for lying here.
UNK: When Eva found out that Cole was sleeping with your wife,
UNK: she came to you with a plan.
UNK: Yes.
Beckett : He had betrayed the both of you. You wanted revenge.
Robert : The man looked me in the eye every day,
Robert : and then he went to my home, to my wife?
Robert : He deserved what he got.
Beckett : So, you staged the attack on Eva in her house?
Robert : Yes, so that PI would see it, and the trail would lead straight to Cole.
Robert : It was all for show, of course.
Robert : Cole gets arrested, Eva gets his money and disappears.
Beckett : So how did Eva end up dead?
Ryan : I don't know.
Robert : I spoke to her the next morning.
Robert : Eva was stressed out. Regretful.
Robert : Said the plan was never her idea in the first place.
UNK: Whose plan was it? I don't know.
Robert : But she was having second thoughts
Robert : about seeing Cole convicted for her murder.
Robert : And she was thinking about coming forward.
UNK: And that would've ruined you, which is why you killed her.
Cole : No, no, no. All I did was help Eva.
Robert : I had nothing to do with her murder.
UNK: Yeah, Mr. James, when was the last time that you actually saw Eva?
Robert : After we got back from the woods, we cleaned up her house.
Robert : And then I gave her a key to one
Robert : of the company's corporate apartments,
Robert : and I left.
Robert : Corporate apartment?
Robert : She needed a place to stay
Robert : until she could get out of the country.
UNK: So, Robert James was nowhere near
Beckett : Westchester at the time of Cole's death.
Esposito : That pretty much rules him out for both murders.
Beckett : Could also mean he was telling the truth
UNK: that it someone other than Eva that planned the setup.
Ryan : And I think I know who that is.
UNK: CSU checked into that corporate apartment.
Ryan : They found Eva's fingerprints. But that's not all they found.
