UNK: Richard Castle : What are you doing to my desk?
UNK: Kate Beckett : Oh. Uh, well, Gates is on vacation.
UNK: Kate Beckett : So, I figured, why not do my paperwork from home with my husband?
UNK: Kate Beckett : That is, if you want to play hooky with me.
Castle : Is it technically playing hooky if we're working?
Beckett : Well, we could work for a bit, and then, maybe, take a nap.
UNK: Ooh.
Castle : I like naps.
Beckett : Yeah, naps are good.
Castle : Hang on. Oh.
Castle : It's a call forwarded from the PI office.
Castle : Richard Castle Investigations.
UNK: Speaking.
UNK: Yes.
Castle : No. Great! I will see you in 20 minutes.
UNK: All right, bye.
Castle : Well, for once in the relationship, I'm the one getting the call.
Castle : I have a potential client.
Beckett : Castle, that's fantastic!
UNK: No, it's not. No. I was gonna spend the day with you.
Beckett : It's fine. It's not like I don't leave at a moment's notice
Beckett : when there's a homicide.
UNK: Well, then, maybe if I'm done soon,
UNK: I'll swing by later for, you know, a nap.
Beckett : If you do, you'll be napping alone.
Beckett : 'Cause if you're going to your office, then I'm going to mine.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Knock 'em dead, babe.
UNK: Hey.
Eva : Well, hello there.
Castle : You must be Mrs. Whitfield. I'm Richard Castle.
Castle : Ooh, ouch! What happened there?
Eva : Just cut myself.
UNK: Richard.
Eva : Really? Come on, Richard Rodgers, you really don't remember me?
Eva : Faircroft Prep, AP Chem. I used to cheat off of you.
UNK: Eva? Eva Hendricks!
Eva : Eva, yeah.
Eva : Well, I'm Eva Whitfield now.
UNK: Oh, yeah, I'm Richard Castle now.
Eva : I know.
UNK: I've read your books and followed your adventures with the NYPD.
Eva : I heard you were a PI. So, well, I, uh...
Castle : Uh, why don't we go inside and talk?
Castle : So, Eva, tell me, what can I do for you?
UNK: Um, it's my husband, Cole.
Castle : What about him?
Eva : He's a stockbroker.
UNK: He's, um... He's bright, he's handsome, charming.
Eva : We got married and it was so wonderful.
UNK: Um, but then, in the last few years,
Eva : it's gotten so difficult.
Castle : I'm sorry.
UNK: Rick, I think he's cheating on me.
Castle : And what makes you think that?
Eva : The way he acts, um,
Eva : the hours he keeps.
UNK: I mean, I should've known it was coming. He insisted on a prenup.
Eva : I just... I have to find out the truth.
Eva : Can you help me?
Castle : I'm sorry, Eva. This is really not
Castle : the kind of work I like to take on.
Eva : Please, Rick,
Eva : I just want to know if there's anything left in my marriage to fight for.
UNK: Please.
UNK: Please? Yeah, sure.
UNK: Yeah?
Castle : Um, I'll just need Cole's information, and a recent photo.
UNK: Okay. Thank you.
UNK: That's ridiculous.
UNK: And completely...
UNK: No, I worked out this morning.
UNK: Are you even listening? I mean...
Cole : No, no, no.
Cole : What I'm talking about here is knowing about what you have,
Cole : and getting what's right for you.
UNK: Oh, oh, okay, okay.
Scott : But you do realize this could be a serious payday?
UNK: Please, it's chump change, Scott.
UNK: Now, don't be glib, Cole. It's a legitimate point.
UNK: - Scotty. - What?
Cole : Do you trust me?
Scott : Of course I trust you.
UNK: Robert?
UNK: Yes.
Cole : Then we're not selling the company.
Cole : At least, not at this time, and not at that price. Agreed?
Cole : - Agreed. - Agreed.
UNK: Thank you, gentlemen.
Eva : Thank you. All right.
Scott : Cole, you, uh, need a ride back to the office?
Cole : No, I have a doctor's appointment.
Scott : Okay, I will see you there. Robert.
Cole : Hey. So I've got this pain,
Cole : and, uh, I could either go see a doctor, or I could come see you.
UNK: Yeah. I like the sound of that.
Cole : Oh, I'm coming.
Cole : I'll see you soon.
Beckett : So, her husband was having an affair,
Beckett : and you caught him cheating?
