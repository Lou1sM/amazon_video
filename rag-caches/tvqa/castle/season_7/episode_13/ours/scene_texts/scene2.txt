UNK: Hey, you're on your way home?
Castle : Beckett, he killed her!
UNK: Castle...
Castle : He killed her. He...
Castle : Beckett, can you hear me?
Castle : Damn it.
Castle : He took my car.
Castle : Damn it!
Beckett : Castle, where are you?
Castle : Beckett, she's dead. She's dead.
Beckett : Wait, slow down. What's going on?
Castle : Eva was murdered by her husband.
Castle : He killed her, and I couldn't...
Castle : I couldn't stop it. I couldn't...
Castle : Detective Neely, as I already told you,
Castle : I followed Cole Whitfield up here.
Castle : He must have knocked me out, because when I came to,
Castle : he was gone and so was my car.
UNK: Detective Neely : And why did you go to his house in the first place?
Castle : To give the photos to Eva.
Castle : That's when I heard the screaming.
Castle : And I saw him dragging her body through the kitchen.
Castle : Before I could do anything, he drove off with her.
Neely : Mr. Castle, it says here you only got your PI license a month ago.
Castle : Yes, so?
Neely : So, are you sure about what you saw?
UNK: Of course, I'm sure! I...
Beckett : Detective, I know Castle. If he says it happened, it did.
UNK: Officer Kemp : Part of his story checks out.
UNK: Officer Kemp : We found his car parked on an access road about 100 yards from here.
Beckett : Whitfield must have hidden Castle's car in order to make his getaway.
UNK: Detective, I am not making this up.
Castle : The Whitfield house is a crime scene.
Castle : If we go to that kitchen, we will find blood.
Castle : Eva's blood.
Neely : I'm Detective Neely. Do you have a few minutes to talk?
Cole : Yeah. Come on in.
Cole : So, what is this all about?
Cole : What can I do for you folks?
Neely : Mr. Whitfield, is your wife Eva home?
Cole : No. Why?
Neely : Do you know where she is?
Cole : No, I don't. I got home about 20 minutes ago.
Cole : Found this lovely note from Eva.
