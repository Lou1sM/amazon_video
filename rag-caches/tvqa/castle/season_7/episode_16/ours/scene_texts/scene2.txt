Ryan : But have fun, Castle.
Castle : Trust me, I will.
Beckett : - Are you done? - No.
UNK: Finally made it to Mars!
Castle : Didn't even have to go to astronaut training.
Esposito : So you really signed up to go to Mars, huh?
Castle : Wouldn't that be cool? I mean, not so much for you.
Castle : But for me? Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Detectives? I'm Dr. Rusham Haroun, the bio-science officer.
UNK: Dr. Rusham Harour : He's over here.
Beckett : And nobody saw this happen?
UNK: No, we were all in the module.
Haroum : We heard him scream.
Haroum : He must have fallen into the coupling coil,
Haroum : because right then, the power went out.
Haroum : By the time Angela and I got out here, he was gone.
UNK: It took us another 10 minutes to get the power restored.
Beckett : It looks like a stab wound.
Esposito : Delivered with a lot of force.
Castle : Well, where's the murder weapon? There wasn't one.
Haroum : But one of his tools, his screwdriver, is missing.
Haroum : It looks like this.
Esposito : It's pretty rocky around here. There's no footprints.
UNK: And since the killer was probably wearing a suit,
UNK: there's not gonna be any DNA.
Beckett : Let's get his body to the morgue
Beckett : and find out. And get CSU down here.
Beckett : I want this place searched.
Beckett : If no one's been in or out, then that murder weapon is still inside here.
UNK: Dr. Haroun, I'd like to speak to the other astronauts, please.
Haroum : They're inside. Follow me.
Castle : One small murder for man.
Castle : One giant mystery for mankind.
Beckett : Even when you whisper, everyone can hear you.
UNK: I may need to replace the power coupling
UNK: and reboot A-level systems...
UNK: - Didn't read that, Richwood. - Interference. Come again?
Tom : Watch out!
Kim : You know the rest.
