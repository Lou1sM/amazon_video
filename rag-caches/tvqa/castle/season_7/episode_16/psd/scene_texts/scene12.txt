George : But I chickened out. The hacks,
George : setting it up to lead back to Granger, that's as far as I got.
George : I never went inside,
George : and I sure as hell didn't kill anyone.
Castle : Then why were you leaving town?
George : She dumped me.
UNK: How was I supposed to keep going to work there?
George : I needed a fresh start.
UNK: And since I got her letter,
George : I've spent nights drowning my sorrows at O'Malley's.
George : That's where I was when Tom was murdered.
George : You can ask them.
UNK: Okay. Then, so who else could've used your hack
Beckett : to get through the simulation's airlock?
George : It was calibrated to my biometrics. No one else could've used it.
Castle : - But someone did. - No.
George : If they got in, they did it some other way.
Beckett : There is no other way.
George : I'm not so sure about that.
Beckett : What do you mean?
George : I studied the facility plans.
Ryan : The simulation is like a bank vault.
Beckett : To get in, you gotta get past guards,
George : security systems, cameras.
George : But like a bank vault,
George : if you're motivated enough,
George : there's always another way in.
Castle : You really think someone could have
Castle : tunneled their way into the sim?
Beckett : No, but since George's alibi checked out,
UNK: we're gonna have to look at all of our options.
Beckett : Including the unlikely ones.
Beckett : According to George's map,
Beckett : this abandoned utility access runs directly under Jansen's facility.
