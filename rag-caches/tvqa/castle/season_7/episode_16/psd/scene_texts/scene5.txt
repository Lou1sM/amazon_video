Tom : Watch out!
Kim : You know the rest.
Beckett : And where were each one of you when this happened?
Kim : Angela, Rusham and I were here, in the command module.
Kim : Mikhail was over in engineering.
Beckett : And is there access to the outside from engineering?
Mikhail : There is emergency hatch,
Mikhail : but if I had gone through it, the alarm would have sounded.
Kim : Plus, as part of the program, we're all closely monitored.
Kim : In case we lose consciousness
Kim : or there's a suit malfunction on an EVA.
Kim : We all have trackers under our skin.
Haroum : And M.I.R.A. keeps a record of all our movements.
Castle : Who's Mira?
Angela : That's what we call the mission computer.
Beckett : Well, I'd like to take a look at those records.
UNK: I will be happy to provide you
Mira : with any records you require, Detective Beckett.
Beckett : It talks?
Kim : Yeah. We think of her as the sixth member of the crew.
Castle : Isn't that a little 2001?
Haroum : She is programmed to learn and adapt,
Haroum : but she's more Siri than HAL.
Haroum : Ask her where you are.
Castle : M.I.R.A., where are we?
Mira : You are aboard the vessel Tenzing Norgay
Mira : in the northern lowlands of Mars.
Mikhail : She actually thinks she's on Mars.
UNK: Regardless, I'm gonna need to ask
Beckett : all of you to join me at the precinct
Beckett : so I can interview you properly.
UNK: That could be a problem.
Ed : I'm sorry, Detective, I can't let you remove the astronauts.
Ed : I don't have that kind of authority.
Beckett : Well, then who does?
UNK: Viggo Jansen : That would be me.
UNK: Viggo Jansen : And my astronauts aren't going anywhere.
Castle : That's Viggo Jansen! The Viggo Jansen.
Jansen : Detective, if we shut down now,
Jansen : we will lose months of priceless data.
UNK: Millions of dollars' worth of experiments will be compromised.
Jansen : We'll lose half a year, and we don't have that time.
Beckett : Mr. Jansen, it's not a request.
