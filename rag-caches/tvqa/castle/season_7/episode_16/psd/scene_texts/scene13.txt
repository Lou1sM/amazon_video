Castle : Yeah, but who would hate Tom enough
Castle : to tunnel through five feet of concrete to kill him?
Beckett : I don't know, but...
Beckett : But it looks like someone did.
Beckett : Castle, boost me up.
Castle : Why am I always on the bottom?
Castle : Yes, dear.
UNK: Planets, dank access ways.
Castle : Is it just me, or does this remind you of Alien?
Beckett : I know that you want this to be science fiction,
Beckett : but we are not in space.
Castle : No! But wouldn't you like it to be?
Castle : Come on. You're a sci-fi geek.
Castle : Wouldn't you just love to go to Mars?
Beckett : Of course, I would.
Beckett : That's why I applied to Ian Rasher's program last year.
Castle : Wait, what? You applied to go to Mars?
Castle : Without me? When?
Beckett : Well, we were fighting.
Castle : Oh, okay. Well, I deserved that.
UNK: Oh, jeez. Castle.
Castle : See anything?
Beckett : Someone did tunnel up.
Beckett : Castle, I think I found the murder weapon.
