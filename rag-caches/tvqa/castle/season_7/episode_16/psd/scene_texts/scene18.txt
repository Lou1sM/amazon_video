Esposito : You're on Mars.
Mikhail : I hate to admit, but it's good to be out.
Beckett : Go ahead.
Mikhail : What they say? Fresh air, Times Square?
Esposito : Well, after the Mars simulation, prison should be a breeze.
Mikhail : So I was trading information.

Mikhail : I was leaving the planet and never coming back.
Mikhail : I wanted to make sure my family was taken care of.
UNK: Oh, noble.
Mikhail : You Americans. Little corruption never hurt anyone.
Beckett : I don't think Tom would agree.
