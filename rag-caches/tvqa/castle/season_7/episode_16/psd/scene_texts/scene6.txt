UNK: A man has been murdered, I need to conduct an investigation.
Jansen : And I will do everything in my power to help you,
Jansen : short of shutting down my sim.
Jansen : Mars is our generation's space race,
UNK: and my team's gonna be first,
UNK: not the Chinese, or Mars One,
UNK: or that puffed-up movie producer, Sir Ian Rasher.
Beckett : I could get a court order to compel you.
Jansen : And with my legal team, it'll take you months.
UNK: Or we could work together.
Jansen : I give you all the access you need,
Jansen : and my simulation keeps running.
Becket : Fine. For now.
Becket : But if I find out any of those people are responsible,
Becket : you won't stop me from removing them.
Ryan : Yeah. Well, according to this tracking data,
Ryan : none of them seem responsible.
Ryan : They were all exactly where they said they were
Ryan : at Tom's approximate time of death.
Ryan : It even confirms that the mission's rover
Ryan : was still parked at the habitat at the time of the incident.
UNK: Well, there goes my Rise of the Machines theory.
Beckett : Okay, so if all the people inside are accounted for,
Beckett : then our killer must have come from outside of the simulation.
Jansen : We would know.
Jansen : The airlock door is the only way in or out.
Jansen : It's alarmed and monitored.
Ed : Uh, excuse me.
Mira : Detective Beckett, there's a message
Ed : coming in for you from the habitat.
Ed : I can put it on the monitor if you like.
Beckett : Yeah, please.
UNK: Hey, Espo, what do you got?
Esposito : I was just going through our victim's video diaries.
Esposito : There's something you need to see.
UNK: Six months in, and I know part of
UNK: this mission is a psych experiment.
UNK: Maybe the close quarters are starting to get to me,
Castle : but I think I'm starting to see things.
UNK: When I was out there today,
UNK: I could've sworn I saw someone,
UNK: and it's not the first time.
