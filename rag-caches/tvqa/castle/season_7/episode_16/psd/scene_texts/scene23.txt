Jansen : Why? Who told you Tom was a threat?
Mira : I'm sorry. I'm not authorized to give you that information.
Castle : Because in her mind,
Castle : that information would be a threat to the mission.
UNK: There's got to be another way to find out.
Jansen : There is. I can reboot her.
Jansen : Everything she's learned will be wiped.
Jansen : But all recorded memory will stay intact.
Jansen : We'll find out pretty quickly what happened.
Castle : What's that?
Jansen : Someone's opened the vents to the outside.
Jansen : We're taking in atmosphere.
Castle : It's M.I.R.A. She's trying to protect herself.
Jansen : No. M.I.R.A., don't shut me out!
Beckett : You said that this is harmful,
Beckett : but it wouldn't kill us, right?
Jansen : Short term. Long term, it's deadly. We have to get out of here.
Beckett : It's locked. Call for help!
Jansen : Communications are dead.
Castle : M.I.R.A., open the door!
Castle : Open the pod bay door.
Castle : I wanted to go to Mars, not die on Mars.
