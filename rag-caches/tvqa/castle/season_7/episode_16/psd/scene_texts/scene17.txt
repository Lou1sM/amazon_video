UNK: I went to make sure that
UNK: I hadn't left anything there that could point back to me.
Beckett : Like the murder weapon?
Granger : Oh, come on, if I killed Tom, do you really think I'd be stupid enough
Granger : to leave the murder weapon there?
Granger : Besides, I was never inside the simulation.
UNK: That would've been way too risky.
Granger : Too many opportunities to get caught.
Beckett : Then why the gas mask?
Granger : It was a precaution.
Granger : I wasn't using the tunnel to get in. It was a drop point.
Beckett : You were working with someone on the inside.
Granger : I needed access, he needed money.
Granger : So we struck a deal.
Granger : He'd download schematics and plans
Granger : and drop them for me in the tunnel.
UNK: Who?
UNK: Mikhail Dankov. The astronaut?
UNK: If Tom was onto him, then maybe he's your killer.
Beckett : We checked his tracker.
Beckett : He was inside the habitat at the time of the murder.
Granger : Mikhail knew if his movements were being recorded,
Granger : he'd never get away with what we were doing.
Granger : So he beat the system.
Granger : He cloned his tracker before they embedded it under his skin.
Granger : As long as no one was looking, he could slip out at any time.
UNK: Mikhail?
UNK: Yes?
Esposito : I'd like a few words with you.
Beckett : What about?
Esposito : Your business relationship with Clint Granger.
Esposito : Hey! Hey!
UNK: Come on, Mikhail, you're crazy.
