Beckett : We get a match in the system?
Ryan : Not our system. But as part of the Mars 2018 program,
Ryan : every applicant had to submit sample DNA.
Ryan : So we ran it against that database, and guess who popped up?
Castle : No! Granger's our alien?
Beckett : So he was getting in and out,
Beckett : just not the way we thought.
Castle : Which means his alibi was a lie.
Castle : As soon as he knew we were onto him...
Beckett : He went back to destroy the evidence. You bringing him in?
UNK: I would, if we could find him.
Ryan : But he's not at his place and he's not answering his phone.
Beckett : Okay, put out an APB.
Beckett : After our encounter in the dark, he might be on the run.
Esposito : I may know how to find him.
Ryan : That gas mask, it's an uncommon make.
Esposito : Not a lot of suppliers in the city carry them.
Esposito : But I was able to track down the serial number
UNK: to an Army-Navy supply store uptown.
Beckett : Did they confirm that Granger bought it?
Esposito : No, the mask was purchased a couple of months back,
Esposito : so no one remembered the buyer,
Esposito : but it was charged to a corporate account.
Esposito : A company called Newton Endeavors.
Beckett : What do we know about them?
UNK: Not much. I couldn't find anything on the Web,
Esposito : but I was able to track down an address
UNK: out in Queens, in Willets Point.
Beckett : Well done.
Esposito : Newton Endeavors. Sounds space-related.
UNK: Space, the final frontier.
UNK: These are the voyages of Castle and Beckett.
UNK: Their ongoing mission to explore strange new motives.
UNK: To seek out new witnesses and new suspects for murder.
UNK: - To boldly go where... - Oh, right over here.
Ed : Excuse me?
Beckett : Is this Newton Endeavors?
Ed : I'm sorry. This is private property.
UNK: I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
UNK: NYPD.
UNK: I'm gonna have to ask you to open that door.
Beckett : What the hell?
Castle : Is it just me, or does that capsule look incredibly familiar?
