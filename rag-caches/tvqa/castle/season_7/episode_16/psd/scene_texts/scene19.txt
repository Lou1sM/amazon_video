Granger : No one was looking forward to spending
Mikhail : rest of lives with him on other planet.
Beckett : And yet, you are the only one
UNK: that is unaccounted for during his murder,
Beckett : which means you are the only one
UNK: that could've killed him.
Mikhail : Mmm, no, I could not.
Mikhail : I can prove where I was during the murder.
UNK: How?
Mikhail : When Commander Kim sent me down to engineering,
Mikhail : I used rare time alone to take pictures and download schematics
Mikhail : from life support, to give to Granger.
Mikhail : I still have the drive with all of my photos.
UNK: They're time-stamped with the mission clock.
Esposito : So your alibi is that you were spying for Granger?
Mikhail : Go. Look at my photos.
Mikhail : You'll see.
Ryan : So, I went through all of Mikhail's photos
Ryan : from the night Tom was murdered.
Ryan : As you can see, he's telling the truth.
Ryan : See his reflection?
Castle : Yeah. And the module clock confirms the time.
Beckett : Maybe he faked the time.
Beckett : Or maybe it was Granger after all.
Castle : It wasn't Granger. Uh, Ryan, go back.
Castle : To... There! Now, zoom in on the window.
UNK: Look down on the bottom right.
UNK: Is that the rover?
UNK: I thought the computer said that it was docked during the murder.
Castle : Clearly, the computer was wrong.
UNK: Now, uh, push in on the rover's arm,
UNK: and filter out some of that reflection.
Beckett : It's the screwdriver!
