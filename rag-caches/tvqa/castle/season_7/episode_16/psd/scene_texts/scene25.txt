UNK: M.I.R.A.'s not AI. Yes, she can learn and adapt.
Jansen : But she's a machine. She cannot think for herself.
Castle : Then why'd she try to kill us?
Ed : It wasn't M.I.R.A. We just pulled apart the server.
UNK: Someone embedded a subroutine into the OS reset program.
Ryan : The moment that you tried to reboot her,
Ryan : that subroutine activated, trapping you guys inside.
Ed : It also triggered a dump of M.I.R.A.'s memory circuits.
Ed : All the mission data is gone.
Beckett : So this was a failsafe installed by whoever was behind this.
Beckett : We were never meant to find out about the rover, or M.I.R.A.,
Beckett : and on the off chance that we did,
Beckett : the killer wanted to make sure we didn't get any further.
Castle : By killing the only witness.
UNK: M.I.R.A. and her memory banks.
Jansen : It has to be one of the astronauts.
Jansen : They're the only ones who could've planted that subroutine.
UNK: The only ones who could've convinced M.I.R.A. that Tom was a threat.
Beckett : Yeah, but with the memory data unrecoverable,
Beckett : it's impossible to know which one.
Castle : No. Not impossible.
Castle : As a matter of fact, there's only one explanation that makes sense.
