Castle : There's your killer, holding the murder weapon.
Castle : The rover did it!
Jansen : The rover was out? This can't be right.
Jansen : All the data from M.I.R.A. indicates
UNK: that the rover was docked when Tom was killed.
Castle : I'd say the data's wrong.
UNK: And according to your literature,
Castle : that rover has the speed and dexterity
Castle : to kill with mathematical precision.
Beckett : Mr. Jansen, who has access to the rover controls?
Beckett : One of your astronauts? Someone at mission control?
Jansen : No one has access.
Jansen : The rover is an extremely complex piece of equipment.
Jansen : Under human control, there's too high a margin for error,
Jansen : so we designed it to interface solely with the computer.
Jansen : Our astronauts describe the sort of task they want carried out
Jansen : and M.I.R.A. executes it.
UNK: Is it possible someone could've asked her to kill Tom?
Jansen : M.I.R.A. wouldn't comply with that sort of command.
Jansen : But something's wrong. I need to talk to her.
Becket : Well, is there somewhere we can do that privately, without anyone hearing?
Jansen : Yeah. The computer module pod, inside the sim.
Kim : What's going on?
Jansen : Let you know soon.
Jansen : In here.
Jansen : There. I've cut off communications with the rest of the habitat.
Jansen : No one can hear us.
Esposito : Is that you, Dr. Jansen?
Jansen : Yes, M.I.R.A.
Beckett : What are you doing on Mars, Doctor?
UNK: I came to talk to you.
