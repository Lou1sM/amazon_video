UNK: Oh!
UNK: Yes!
UNK: Kate Beckett : I can't wait to take off my... Got ya!
UNK: ...shoes.
Alexis : Dad! Beckett.
UNK: Richard Castle : So much for a quiet evening at home.
Alexis : I thought you guys were working late tonight.
Castle : Slow murder day. We got off early. You're playing laser tag?
Castle : Without me?
Castle : Is that my gear?
Alexis : Oh, Dad, Beckett, this is David.
Alexis : He bet me I couldn't beat him.
Beckett : She trounced you, didn't she? Yeah.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Oh, my! What is going on down here?
Castle : Far too much, apparently. Uh, are those my pajamas?
UNK: Uh... Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Martha : I'm so sorry. Ben...
UNK: Um, family, Benjamin. Ben, meet my family.
Beckett : Castle, we got a murder.
UNK: Uh, to solve, not to commit.
UNK: Bye!
UNK: But those were my softest pajamas,
UNK: and now I'm gonna have to burn 'em.
Castle : Is it just me, or is the loft getting awfully small these days?
Beckett : Well, four adults together in one space.
Beckett : We're bound to step on each other's toes.
UNK: Yeah. Well, there was a lot more toes than usual tonight.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Hey, guys. Glad you're here.
UNK: You're gonna wanna see this. Especially you, Castle.
Beckett : What is this place?
Castle : It's Mission Control.
Castle : And that's Mars!
Ryan : And there's your body.
Castle : Our victim is on Mars?
Castle : The secret manned mission to Mars rumors were true. I knew it!
Beckett : You know, this might be a little out of our jurisdiction.
UNK: Javier Esposito : It's not Mars.
UNK: Javier Esposito : This is Operations Director Ed Redley.
UNK: Javier Esposito : This is Detectives Beckett and Ryan. Castle.
UNK: Uh, what you're seeing is a live feed
UNK: Ed Redley : from a simulation we're conducting
UNK: Ed Redley : in advance of a real Mars mission.
