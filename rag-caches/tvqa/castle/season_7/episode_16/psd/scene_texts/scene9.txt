UNK: Huh. Huh?
UNK: "Huh," what?
UNK: This is a video of Granger's apartment lobby
UNK: the night of the hack.
UNK: Check it out. This guy enters the building at 11 : 05 p.m.,
UNK: just before the hack took place. Now watch...
UNK: Fifteen minutes later...
Beckett : He leaves the building.
Beckett : He could have piggybacked on Granger's wireless,
Beckett : and used that to carry out the attack on the simulation security.
Ryan : Yeah, but who is he?
UNK: Name's George Reyes.
Esposito : The folks down at Mars 2018 recognized him immediately.
UNK: He's the senior facilities engineer,
UNK: and he called in sick yesterday.
Esposito : Nobody's been able to reach him since.
Beckett : Did he have a motive to break into the simulation and kill Tom?
Esposito : Not that anyone knew.
Esposito : But his colleagues say that he's been acting secretive
UNK: for the last couple of days,
Esposito : ever since receiving a private communique from his wife.
UNK: What has his wife got to do with this?
Esposito : Maybe everything.
Esposito : Ask me who his wife is. Who's his wife?
Esposito : Angela Olvera.
Esposito : One of the other astronauts.
Beckett : So what was on the message?
Angela : I was letting George know that I wanted out of our marriage.
Castle : You broke up with him from space?
Angela : He was sending me all these sweet e-mails.
Angela : I couldn't let it go on.
Angela : I had to tell him that I had fallen for someone else.
Angela : Someone on the mission.
Castle : Was it Tom? No. Not Tom.
