UNK: George Reyes : We were a team, Angela and me.
UNK: We were gonna go to Mars together or not at all.
UNK: George Reyes : But when she got in and I didn't,
UNK: George Reyes : I couldn't stand in her way.
Castle : Hard enough to have her leave the planet,
Castle : but to leave you for someone else?
UNK: You must've been devastated.
George : Try utterly destroyed.
Beckett : Is that why you hacked security?
Beckett : In order to break into the simulation,
Beckett : and kill the man that you thought was Angela's lover?
George : I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with Tom's death.
George : I was going to sabotage the mission.
UNK: I figured if the simulation suffered a catastrophic failure,
George : it'd set the program back, and Angela would come home to me.
