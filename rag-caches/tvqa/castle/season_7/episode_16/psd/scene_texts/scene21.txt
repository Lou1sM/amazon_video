Jansen : You remember Detective Beckett and Richard Castle?
Beckett : Of course. How can I help you?
Beckett : Are we seriously about to interrogate a computer?
UNK: Detective, the word "interrogate"
Mira : implies you believe I am guilty of something.
Mira : Of what do you think I am guilty?
Castle : Well, at least she's not asking for a lawyer.
UNK: Uh, M.I.R.A., we'd like to know where the rover was
Beckett : when Tom Richwood was killed.
Mira : I already gave you that information, Detective.
