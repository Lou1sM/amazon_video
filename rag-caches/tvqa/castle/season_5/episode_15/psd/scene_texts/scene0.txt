UNK: Martha Rodgers : I choose to take the higher ground and ignore that.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Breakfast is served.

Martha : - this past year. - Oh.
UNK: So the student becomes...
UNK: A failed student.
Castle : The drop-out.

Castle : Mother, you are forever forbidden from practicing the art of Pancake-do.
Martha : Where did I go wrong?
Castle : Where do I begin?
UNK: But Alexis isn't even here. Why are you making these?
Castle : You miss her.
UNK: Oh.
Martha : Well, don't you?
Castle : Yes, of course I do. But Columbia is just a cab ride away.

UNK: and now she's just gone.
