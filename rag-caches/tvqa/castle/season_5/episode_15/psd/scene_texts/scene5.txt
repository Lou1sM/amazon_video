UNK: I see students who are just like me and nothing like me.
UNK: And I feel overwhelmed
Alexis : with all the possibilities,
Alexis : with how lucky I am to be a part of this,
UNK: and how there is nowhere on Earth I'd rather be right now.
Alexis : Now, stand by for a geek alert.
UNK: Me and my friend Sara
Alexis : got tickets to go see Dr. Posner speak at the Beaumont tonight.
UNK: And for those of you who don't know,
Alexis : Dr. Posner is one of the foremost thinkers on climate change,
Alexis : a personal hero of mine...
Castle : Do you see? Are you watching?
Beckett : Castle, if the kidnappers knew that Alexis and Sara were friends...
UNK: They did know. They had to know.
UNK: They tracked Sara to the hotel from this video.
UNK: Alexis posted it yesterday afternoon at 2 : 36.
UNK: The kidnappers must have accessed her website.
Beckett : Okay, I'm contacting Tech right now.
UNK: Have them trace every IP address that accessed that site after 2 : 36 p.m.
Beckett : Which might take time, depending on...
Castle : What if she doesn't have time?
Beckett : - Castle, listen to me. - Don't!
Castle : Don't promise me you'll find her unless you can do it.
