Castle : That's acceptance.
Beckett : Wait, wouldn't acceptance be letting her go,
Beckett : seeing where she flies and then being okay with it?
UNK: Yeah, but I wouldn't be okay with that. I don't want to see where she goes.
UNK: Or what other birds of prey are out there, or what other nests or...
Beckett : So is that acceptance? Or denial?
UNK: Well, it was acceptance till you started applying your fiendish logic.
UNK: Lanie Parish : How about you guys apply some fiendish logic to this?
UNK: Lanie Parish : Meet Hasim Farouk. Man versus van, at 1 : 00 a.m. Last night.
UNK: Lanie Parish : He was killed instantly.
UNK: Javier Esposito : Knocked right out of his shoes at the point of impact.
UNK: So, hit-and-run?
Esposito : Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg. A witness, homeless guy,
Esposito : said that the victim emptied his gun at the van,
Esposito : just stood in the middle of the street, shooting, right until it hit him.
Castle : Why would he do that?
Esposito : I don't know, but he definitely knew his way around guns.
UNK: Jan!
UNK: This is a SIG P220 S,
UNK: with a weight-compensator, target sights,
UNK: and a custom-molded grip to his hand.
Esposito : This was a serious shooter.
Beckett : What else do we know about him?
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Well, Hasim Farouk is a Saudi national, living here as a student.
Castle : Majoring in what? Urban warfare?
Ryan : Undeclared, actually. Up at Columbia.
Beckett : So what was he doing in Lower Manhattan?
Castle : More importantly,
Castle : what is Columbia doing admitting gun-toting lunatics,
Castle : and are there any more of them?
