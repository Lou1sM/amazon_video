Beckett : His fingernails were pulled off.
Castle : I don't understand.
Castle : Henson was working for the kidnappers.
Castle : Why would they torture him?
Esposito : I don't know.
Castle : Well, then what do you think?
Castle : What is your best guess as to what this means for Alexis?
Castle : For the girls?
Harris : It means getting them back may be a little more complicated.
Alexis : Were you crying in there?
Sara : I thought the running water would cover it up.
Alexis : We'll be all right, Sara.
Sara : I thought this was all about the money.
Sara : But these people speak Arabic.
Sara : My father is a hated man back in Egypt.
Alexis : We need to get out of here.
Sara : The only way out is through that door and it's locked.
UNK: Hey, are those bobby pins?
Beckett : There are hopeful signs here, Castle.
Beckett : They've gone out of their way not to harm the girls.
Beckett : They want them alive.
Beckett : That'll give us time to track down whoever is behind this.
UNK: How?
Castle : Our main suspect is dead,
Castle : the only thing Stevens knew is where the farmhouse is,
UNK: and we have no idea who we're looking for.
Beckett : The FBI is searching the farm for evidence,
Beckett : they're canvassing the area for witnesses that might have seen
Beckett : whoever was on the property.
Castle : All of which is just another way of saying that we're back to square one.
UNK: It won't be the first time.
Beckett : We're gonna solve this, Castle. We will find a way.
UNK: "We've done it before, with less to go on."
Beckett : You know who told me that?
Bram : I did.
Castle : In a fit of irrational optimism.
Beckett : Castle, go see your mom.
Beckett : Get some rest. Come back in the morning.
Beckett : No one is giving up here.
UNK: No, I can't. I...
Beckett : Here's a decaf.
Beckett : It's for the road.
Castle : Thank you.
