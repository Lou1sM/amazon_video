Castle : Right now is just Alexis' time to make her own way in the world.
Castle : But she'll be back.
Castle : Like Simba in The Lion King. It's the circle of life.
Martha : Oh, darling.
UNK: Kate Beckett : You seem to have adopted a real Zen-like attitude
UNK: about all this, Castle.
UNK: Well, I've realized I've been a little overprotective of Alexis at times.
Castle : Okay, constantly.
Castle : But since she's left for Columbia, I've learned to let go.
UNK: I stopped checking her video blog.
Castle : I don't ask to meet her boyfriend anymore.
Castle : I've come to realize that, like a bird, Alexis needed to leave the nest.
Castle : So, I let her fly, turned around, and I strode away.
