UNK: Fbi Tech Guy : Were you expecting someone to Skype you?
UNK: No.
Castle : - Alexis! - Daddy?
Sara : Oh, my God,
Alexis : I tried to call 9-1-1, but it wouldn't go through.
Castle : Baby, are you okay? Where are you?
Esposito : I don't know.
Alexis : The phone's about to die. Um...
Alexis : We're in some building.
Alexis : We were locked in a room, but we got out.
Castle : Where? What building?
Castle : What's outside the window?
UNK: Nothing, I can't see anything, the windows are covered up.
UNK: They're coming. They're coming. They found out we're gone.
Castle : Baby, get out of there. Get out of there now!
Martha : Go! Go!
Castle : Can you tell where the call's coming from?
UNK: Fbi Tech Guy : Tracking now.
UNK: Fbi Tech Guy : This can't be right.
Castle : Why? What is it?
UNK: Fbi Tech Guy : This says that the call originated from a cell tower in Paris, France.
UNK: Help...
