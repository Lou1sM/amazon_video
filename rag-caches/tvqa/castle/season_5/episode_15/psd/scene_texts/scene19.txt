Sara : Oh, my God.
Sara : What's out there?
Alexis : A hallway. Like in an office building. I don't see anyone.
Sara : What if they catch us? Then what?
Alexis : They want us alive. Just remember that.
Alexis : Here's the plan. We head down the hall.
Alexis : There has to be a way out.
Alexis : If it looks like there's two ways, we split up
Alexis : and double our chances that one of us makes it out.
UNK: I think I'm gonna throw up.
Alexis : You're not going to throw up.
Alexis : You're going to get out of here.
Sara : Okay. Okay.
Martha : - Go. - No, no.
Alexis : We talked about this. Go!
