Harris : Go! Go, go, go!
UNK: FBI! Search warrant!
Harris : Go, go, go!
Castle : You know, I still remember.
Castle : When Alexis was born,
Castle : they handed me this tiny person, all bundled up.
UNK: She just stared up at me.
Castle : And when I looked down at her, this feeling hit me.
Castle : Like I'd been struck by lightning.
Castle : It was love.
Castle : That instant,
Castle : inexplicable love you can only feel for your child.
Castle : In that moment, I knew.
Castle : I knew my life had changed forever.
Castle : And now it's about to change again.
UNK: Gates.
UNK: Okay.
Gates : The farmhouse was empty.
UNK: Alexis and Sara are not there.
UNK: You're sure she's not in the cellar or some hidden room somewhere?
Harris : We searched top to bottom. They're gone.
Harris : We did find these.
Harris : Either of them belong to Alexis?
Castle : Yeah. That one there,
Castle : that's hers.
Castle : What does it mean that her coat's here and she's not?
