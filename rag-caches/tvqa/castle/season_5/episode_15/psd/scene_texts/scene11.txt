UNK: Douglas Stevens : I got nothing to say.
UNK: Well, then you're gonna go down for all of it.
UNK: You were driving the van.
UNK: That's murder, two counts of kidnapping.
UNK: Do you know how many years you're going to be in jail for?
UNK: It's in the triple digits.
UNK: Tell us where the girls are. That's your only hope.
Castle : Let me know when my ambulance gets here.
Castle : I'd like a minute with him.
UNK: I just said I don't wanna talk, so you can't question me.
Stevens : I have rights.
UNK: I'm not gonna say anything without a lawyer.
Castle : I'm not a cop.
Stevens : Then who are you?
Castle : You remember the girl with the red hair?
Castle : I'm her father.
Castle : Please know,
Castle : I will do whatever it takes to get her back.
Castle : Those police outside are my friends.
Castle : My daughter's friends, too.
Castle : So it's just you and me.
