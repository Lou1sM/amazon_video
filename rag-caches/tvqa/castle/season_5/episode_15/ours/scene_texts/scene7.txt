Castle : Okay, thanks. Yeah, I will.
Castle : That was L.T. From the precinct.
Castle : He said all he knows is that they found the van, parked since last night.
Martha : Well, Beckett will call you as soon as she has some news.
Castle : The van's in Greenpoint.
UNK: She would've gotten there over an hour ago.
Castle : The only reason she wouldn't have called...
Martha : Stop it, Richard.
UNK: We... We don't know that.
Martha : Oh, darling, go to Greenpoint.
Martha : Go. Go, I can handle things here.
UNK: Hey.
Beckett : Castle, what are you doing here?
UNK: Precinct told me that you found the van.
Castle : Why the hell wouldn't you call me?
Beckett : Because we don't know what this is yet.
Beckett : Castle, please. You don't need to see this, okay?
Castle : - What's in the van? - Castle, just please...
Castle : What's in the van?
Sara : Oh, my God!
UNK: Oh, Lanie, whose blood is that?
Castle : Did someone die in there?
Castle : Lanie, did she die in there?
Beckett : Castle, we don't know. Okay?
UNK: Not yet. Lanie just got here.
Lanie : - What is Alexis' blood type? - A-positive.
Lanie : Okay, just give me a minute.
UNK: Come on, let's go over here.
Castle : Is it a match?
UNK: It's B-negative. It's not from your baby.
UNK: - Oh, God, thank you. - I'm right there with you, honey.
Lanie : I got to go let Agent Harris know.
Castle : So she's safe. She's here somewhere, right?
UNK: She's got to be around here somewhere.
Martha : She was.
UNK: Castle, there is a blood trail that led from the van, and it stopped.
Beckett : We think that the kidnappers changed cars.
Castle : Whose van is it?
Beckett : It was stolen a week ago.
Castle : - Any fingerprints? - CSU is looking.
Beckett : We've got uniforms canvassing the area.
Beckett : Castle, listen, if there is a lead, we are gonna find it.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : I'll be right back. Okay?
UNK: Mr. El-Masri, I need to speak to you. We're absolutely positive...
UNK: Oh, thank God!
UNK: Hey.
Lina : The blood. It's not from Sara.
UNK: And not Alexis either.
Anwar : - Then there's hope. - Yeah.
Anwar : I regret that your daughter was drawn into this.
Castle : What is it exactly they've been drawn into?
Anwar : I wish I knew.
UNK: Sara?
UNK: Sara?
Alexis : Sara, are you okay?
UNK: Sara El-masri : I think.
Beckett : Where are we?
Esposito : I don't know.
Sara : Wait, the speech. The hotel.
Sara : We left the hotel and then that guy...
Sara : He forced us into a van and...
Sara : It's all a bit of a blur.
