Beckett : Then what does that make me?
Beckett : Is there anything new?
Gates : Nothing yet on McManus,
Gates : but a search of his room turned up wires, detonator, traces of C-4.
Gates : Looks like he was building a bomb.
UNK: A bomb? Did anyone find it?
Gates : No. If he built something,
Gates : it's either with him, or already out there waiting to go off.
Castle : Beckett, hang on.
Beckett : He had a rifle, Castle. A rifle, not a bomb.
Beckett : If he detonates that thing tonight at the conference
Beckett : and innocent people get hurt...
Castle : Okay, this is not your fault.
Beckett : How is it not my fault? I'm a cop.
Beckett : I had a job to do, and I didn't do it. I've gotta make this right.
UNK: I gotta find that bomb and save Bracken's life.
UNK: Looks like you just got some help.
Esposito : Found him hiding on a rooftop three blocks away.
Beckett : What about the bomb?
Esposito : Asked him about it. Asked him about Melanie Rogers, too.
Esposito : He's not much of a talker.
Ryan : He hasn't said a word since we picked him up.
Beckett : Take him to interrogation.
Esposito : What makes you think he's gonna talk to you?
Beckett : 'Cause I know him.
Beckett : Hi, Robert.
Beckett : I'm Kate.
