Gates : Focus on the ones in Jersey first.
UNK: Twenty-four hours before Bracken speaks.
Gates : Maybe Beckett will have better luck with those threat letters.
Castle : Man, these people need to get a life.
Castle : Most of these guys, it seems their only companionship
Castle : is the space alien that talks to them through their microwave.
Beckett : Yeah, well, there's a lot of lonely and confused people out there,
Beckett : but so far none of the letters match the handwriting
UNK: in our suspect's notebook.
Castle : Considering what he's capable of,
Castle : you would think Bracken would have more formidable enemies.
Beckett : Obviously you never saw the letter that I sent him.
Castle : I did, actually. I liked the way you dotted the "l" on "kill" with a little heart.
Castle : It was a nice touch.
Beckett : Well, I was trying to give it a personal feel.
Castle : Well done.
UNK: So, we're really not gonna talk about this?
UNK: Well, I mean, Castle, what is there to talk about?
UNK: Honestly? Practically everything.
Beckett : Which is why all I can do is treat it like another case.
Beckett : 'Cause that's what it is. It's just like any other case.
Beckett : You're tired, Castle. Why don't you go get some rest?
Castle : No. No, no, I can stay if you like.
Beckett : No, come on. Go. I'll call you if I need anything, okay?
