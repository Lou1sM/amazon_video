Beckett : Castle, look at this vest McManus supposedly made.
UNK: The zip ties and the wires.
Beckett : They're expertly done.
Beckett : You saw McManus, he was barely able to button his own shirt.
Castle : In his current state, no.
UNK: But he could've done this while he was still on his meds.
Beckett : And what about Melanie's body?
UNK: He burned it and then he knocked out her teeth to keep it unidentifiable.
UNK: And then he leaves a duffel bag in a stolen car for us to find?
Beckett : That doesn't make any sense.
Castle : Well, he's mentally ill.
Castle : I mean, not everything he does is going to make sense.
