UNK: Kate!
Beckett : Castle, the driver!
Bracken : His name is Noah Charles.
UNK: He was my driver for five years.
UNK: Any reason why he'd suddenly want you dead?
Bracken : I assume because someone paid him a great deal of money.
Castle : You don't seem shocked.
UNK: There's another world out there, Mr. Castle,
Bracken : one that most people don't see.
Bracken : Run by money, influence, power.
Bracken : And the people in it will do anything they can to stay on top.
