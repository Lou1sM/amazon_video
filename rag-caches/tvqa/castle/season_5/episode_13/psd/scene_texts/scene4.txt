UNK: Why?
Esposito : It's just that you were seen at the Standish Hotel together two nights ago.
Bracken : What are you implying?
Ryan : We're just trying to establish a timeline of Melanie's whereabouts.
Bracken : The hell you are.
Bracken : You're trying to take a professional relationship and use it against me.
Esposito : Look, man, we're not trying to jam you up...
Bracken : I know where I've seen you.
Bracken : You work with Detective Beckett.
Ryan : We just have a few more questions.
Bracken : Then call my lawyer.
Esposito : The guy's guilty as hell, but he has an alibi.
Esposito : He was at some conference all day. Ryan's checking it out now.
