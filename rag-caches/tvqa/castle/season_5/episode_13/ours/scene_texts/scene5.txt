Beckett : You guys, there's...
Esposito : Yo, I just heard back from CSU on that receipt from the duffel bag.
Ryan : They get a print off that smudge?
Esposito : No, but it contained traces of synthetic motor oil and brake pad residue.
Castle : Sounds like our guy's a mechanic.
UNK: So, then maybe he was shopping for the rifle near work.
Beckett : Where's that store again?
UNK: Paterson. Just off the highway.
UNK: It's a place to start.
UNK: All right, I'm gonna get you guys addresses on your way.
Beckett : I'll compile a list of every service station within a five-mile radius,
Beckett : and we'll expand from there.
UNK: Were you gonna say something?
Beckett : No, we're past it.
UNK: Who knew Paterson had so many service stations, huh?
UNK: I'm pretty sure we left Paterson five shops ago.
UNK: "Back in 20 minutes."
Esposito : Well, we don't have 20 minutes to waste.
Esposito : Let's move on to the next one. We'll circle back around.
Ryan : Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Ryan : Hey, look on top of the counter, they sell those hats here.
Esposito : Open up! Police business!
Beckett : All right, I'm coming. Relax.
Ben : Don't break my glass. Yeah, I see it. What?
UNK: How you doing? NYPD. You know this guy?
Ben : Maybe. He looks like one of my mechanics.
Ben : I mean, he used to be. I laid him off, like, three weeks ago.
Ryan : Do you have any paperwork he might have filled out? Maybe a work order?
UNK: I might have some back here.
Ben : Yeah, that's it, right there.
Esposito : Handwriting's a match. It's our guy.
Castle : Robert McManus has a history of schizophrenia.
Castle : Multiple stays at a psych ward.
Castle : Recent episodes were triggered by his son's death.
UNK: Hey.
Beckett : Hey, where are we on deployment?
Esposito : Every beat cop in the city has his photo.
UNK: SWAT's sitting on his place in Jersey,
Esposito : but his neighbors say he hasn't been there in a month.
Esposito : He disappears for long stretches.
UNK: We're scouring through his financials, but they are severely outdated.
UNK: The guy closed his accounts years ago. Basically living off the grid.
Gates : Got something. We canvassed near a diner McManus used to frequent.
Gates : An SRO desk clerk just ID'd him. He's been staying there a month.
