Castle : Where are you going?
Beckett : Castle, I made plans for you. I dressed up for you.
UNK: And I'm not gonna let you ruin this night.
UNK: So what are you gonna do?
UNK: I am going to go over there and open that bloody fridge,
Beckett : and then you and I are going to dinner and never talking about this again.
Castle : No, don't do it. It's too dangerous.
Beckett : Not as dangerous as me if you blow up my plans.
Castle : What if he doesn't let you in?
Beckett : Look at me. He's gonna let me in.
Castle : Not if there's a body in there.
Beckett : There's not a body in there!
Castle : No, no, Beckett.
UNK: No.
UNK: No!
Castle : Beckett, no!
UNK: No!
