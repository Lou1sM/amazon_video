UNK: She'd stay late a couple of times a week trying to catch up.
UNK: And on those nights, I'd pick up an extra shift at the store.
Beckett : And when was the last time you saw her?
UNK: We ate dinner around 7 : 00,
UNK: then both went back to work.
Beckett : And how did she seem? Was she nervous? Upset?
Gavin : No. She was fine.
UNK: And what exactly did your wife do for the IRS?
Gavin : She was an investigator.
Gavin : She went after tax evaders.
UNK: So she must've made enemies.
Gavin : Yeah. Pretty much everyone she audited.
Beckett : And was there anyone in particular that she had trouble with?
