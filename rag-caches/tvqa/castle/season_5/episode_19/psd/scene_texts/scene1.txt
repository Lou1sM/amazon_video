Martha : Now, wait a minute.
Martha : You and Katherine were supposed to be celebrating in Bora Bora this week.
Castle : No, you're right. Have a great time on your retreat.
UNK: On your only son's birthday.
Martha : It is a spa trip, darling, not a guilt trip.
Martha : He's all yours. See you in a week.
UNK: Bye.
Beckett : Come on, Castle. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
UNK: I'll get us a reservation. I'll take you somewhere nice for your birthday.
Castle : - As nice as Bora Bora? - Mmm...
Martha : Oh! Katherine, your ride is here.
Beckett : - Oh, great. - Ride?
Beckett : Yeah. We had a body drop.
Beckett : I asked the boys to pick me up
Beckett : so I'd have enough time to make you breakfast.
Castle : I'm missing another case?
Castle : No, come on. Guys, take me with you.
Beckett : No! Not until you get better.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Castle, how's the knee?
Castle : It's not the knee so much as the boredom.
UNK: - I thought you writers like being alone. - Yeah, if I could write.
Castle : But the painkillers make me a little loopy.
UNK: Last night, I used the word "speculate" three times in the same sentence.
Ryan : Hmm. You must be bored.
UNK: You've actually gone Rear Window.
Castle : Alexis got me those as a joke to cheer me up.
