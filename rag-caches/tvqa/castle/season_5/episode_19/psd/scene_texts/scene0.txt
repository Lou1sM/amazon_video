UNK: Kate Beckett : Almost there, Castle. Just another two weeks.
UNK: Richard Castle : It's already been two weeks. Two weeks is an eternity.
Beckett : Well, maybe next time we go skiing, you're not gonna be such a show-off.
Castle : I wasn't showing off.
Castle : Okay, I was showing off a little bit.
Castle : But I swear to you, I can do a tail-grab with my eyes closed,
Castle : and without breaking my kneecap.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Well, I am off.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Now, the retreat is out of cell phone range,
UNK: Martha Rodgers : so if I don't call you on your birthday, it is not because I have forgotten.
Castle : I won't think it's because you've forgotten.
Castle : I'll think it's because you made other plans.
