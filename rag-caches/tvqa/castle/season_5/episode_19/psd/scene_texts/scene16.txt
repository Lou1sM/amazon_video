UNK: Castle...
Castle : I don't know who Gates was talking to on the phone, but that was not Emily.
Castle : Emily is in that fridge.
UNK: She's not in the apartment.
Beckett : She's not in the fridge. There is no body!
Castle : Yes, there is.
Beckett : Castle, you just apologized to me.
Castle : I rescind the apology. I take it back. She's in the fridge.
Esposito : You know what? Let's just go downstairs
Beckett : and wait for the driver there.
Castle : I am not going anywhere until I see what's in that fridge.
UNK: What?
UNK: You're gonna stay here and wait for him to open it?
Castle : If that's what it takes.
Beckett : Okay, fine.
