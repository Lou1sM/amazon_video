Beckett : It's graffiti that somehow magically appears on that wall.
UNK: Here, I'll play it for you again.
Beckett : How is that possible?
Alexis : I don't know.
Beckett : The only way that it's possible is if someone tampered with the feed
Beckett : and replaced the live image
Beckett : with footage that was recorded before that tag was made.
Rigas : That would be impossible. Unless somebody...
Beckett : Had access to the surveillance system, which you have.
Beckett : And if that is indeed a prerecorded image,
Beckett : then that means that the attack was faked.
Beckett : And that woman that is being beaten and then thrown into the dumpster
Beckett : is not the real Mrs. DeWinter.
UNK: And do you notice that she never actually shows her face?
Beckett : It's almost as if someone is pretending to be her.
Beckett : Someone with the same frame. Someone a lot like you.
Rigas : That is not me!
Beckett : I'm guessing that the real Mrs. DeWinter was killed
Beckett : somewhere else earlier in the evening,
Beckett : and that the killer planted her body in the dumpster so that
Beckett : it would be there when you and your colleagues viewed the faked footage.
Beckett : That video is the perfect alibi for the murderer.
Rigas : I didn't even know Mrs. DeWinter.
Beckett : No, but you do know her husband.
