Castle : No. This is,
Castle : without a doubt,
Castle : the greatest birthday gift of my life!
Castle : How did you do it?
Beckett : I did have a lot of help.
Martha : Yes. You did, indeed.
Castle : - You were all in on it? - Mmm-hmm.
Martha : Michael, Brent, Emily, my brilliant acting students.
Martha : I, of course, was the director.
Castle : And the boys?
Esposito : - Yep. - Oh, yeah, they were great.
Beckett : Except you didn't have to kick down the door.
UNK: - I was in the moment. Yeah. - We wanted to be convincing.
Castle : Alexis, you, too?
Alexis : It's why I bought you the binoculars.
Castle : Even Captain Gates?
Ryan : Yeah, she jumped at the chance to dress you down for any reason.
Castle : - Where is Captain Gates? - She couldn't make it.
UNK: Good.
UNK: Wow.
Beckett : All right!
Castle : You really blew my mind.
Beckett : Yeah, well, I figured the trickiest part would be fooling you
Beckett : and keep a straight face.
Castle : Well, you win the Oscar for Best Pretend Murder.
Castle : I cannot believe the whole thing was staged.
UNK: Staged?
UNK: What?
Beckett : I think I just solved my case!
UNK: Does that mean you're gonna have to go run off and arrest someone now?
UNK: No.
Beckett : Right now, I've got other plans.
Castle : Happy birthday.
Beckett : Look, I'm sorry I had to drag you down here,
Beckett : but I think you might actually hold the key to solving this murder.
Rigas : Sure. But I already told you what I know.
Beckett : Right, that you spotted the murder being committed on surveillance,
Beckett : and then you called 911.
