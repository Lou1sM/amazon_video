Renner : she'd make the criminal charges go away.
Beckett : What kind of a favor could she possibly have wanted from you?
UNK: Because of how well I hid my money, fake names, multiple IDs,
Renner : she asked me to help her disappear.
Renner : - Disappear? - Yeah.
Renner : She said if I helped her get a new identity,
Renner : she'd help me get my life back.
Beckett : And why would she want a new identity?
Renner : She didn't say. But now she's dead and I'm screwed.
UNK: Mr. Renner, where were you two nights ago, at 1 : 38 a. M?
Renner : At my sister's.
Ryan : Beckett, Castle's calling. He says it's an emergency?
Beckett : This is not an emergency!
UNK: I caught him red-handed. Literally red-handed.
Beckett : So then it's gotta be blood.
Castle : What else could it be?
Beckett : Red paint, tomato juice, beets, red velvet cupcakes.
Castle : He bought a tarp and a rope.
Castle : He brought them into the bedroom, where I'm betting, right now,
Castle : he's cutting her into portable pieces.
Castle : Get a warrant. Search that place before there's no evidence left.
UNK: Esposito spoke to the girl. We know she's alive.
Castle : How do you know it's the same girl?
Castle : It's possible he paid someone to be his alibi.
Beckett : Or it's possible something else entirely is going on here.
