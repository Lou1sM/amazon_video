Beckett : Look, I know that you're lonely and that you miss me.
Beckett : I miss you, too.
Beckett : But you don't have to keep making up things to have me come back here.
Castle : Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think this is a ploy to get you here?
Beckett : Look, I don't mean to be...
Castle : No, I know what you mean, all right? And I know what I saw.
Beckett : All right, you know what? I have to get back to the precinct.
Castle : Wow. You really don't believe me.
Beckett : I'll be back later.
Castle : You know what? Don't worry about it.
Castle : I'm fine.
Esposito : Yo. What was the emergency?
Beckett : He wanted me to get a warrant to search the place across the way.
Beckett : Looks like he's taking this whole thing pretty seriously.
