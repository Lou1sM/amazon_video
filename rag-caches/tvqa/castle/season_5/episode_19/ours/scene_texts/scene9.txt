UNK: Wow.
UNK: And wow.
Castle : Happy birthday to me!
Castle : If that's my present, I can't wait to unwrap it.
Beckett : Later. Right now, let's just forget about the murder,
Beckett : go to dinner, celebrate your life, come back and celebrate some more.
Castle : Sounds perfect.
UNK: Okay, so the car's gonna be here in 15 minutes.
Beckett : Would you like a drink from the fridge?
Beckett : The fridge.
UNK: What?
Castle : - He just got a soda from the cabinet. - So?
Castle : So why get it from the cabinet? Why not get it from the fridge?
UNK: Why not get ice?
Castle : Oh, no.
UNK: She's in the refrigerator!
UNK: - Oh, God. - Those plastic trays in the closet!
Castle : Those weren't plastic trays. Those were refrigerator shelves!
UNK: Castle...
Castle : I don't know who Gates was talking to on the phone, but that was not Emily.
Castle : Emily is in that fridge.
UNK: She's not in the apartment.
Beckett : She's not in the fridge. There is no body!
Castle : Yes, there is.
Beckett : Castle, you just apologized to me.
Castle : I rescind the apology. I take it back. She's in the fridge.
Esposito : You know what? Let's just go downstairs
Beckett : and wait for the driver there.
Castle : I am not going anywhere until I see what's in that fridge.
UNK: What?
UNK: You're gonna stay here and wait for him to open it?
Castle : If that's what it takes.
Beckett : Okay, fine.
Castle : Where are you going?
Beckett : Castle, I made plans for you. I dressed up for you.
UNK: And I'm not gonna let you ruin this night.
UNK: So what are you gonna do?
UNK: I am going to go over there and open that bloody fridge,
Beckett : and then you and I are going to dinner and never talking about this again.
Castle : No, don't do it. It's too dangerous.
Beckett : Not as dangerous as me if you blow up my plans.
Castle : What if he doesn't let you in?
Beckett : Look at me. He's gonna let me in.
Castle : Not if there's a body in there.
Beckett : There's not a body in there!
Castle : No, no, Beckett.
UNK: No.
UNK: No!
Castle : Beckett, no!
UNK: No!
Ryan : - Where is she? - She's upstairs! She's in the apartment!
Beckett : - Come on! - Wait for me!
UNK: NYPD! Open up! Open up now!
UNK: - Kick it. Yeah! - Kick it! Kick it! Kick it!
Martha : - Beckett! - Beckett!
UNK: - Beckett! Beckett, you there? - Beckett! Beckett!
Castle : Beckett, where are you?
UNK: Surprise!
Castle : Happy birthday!
Castle : It was all fake?
Castle : Nothing was real. You...
Castle : You let me think I was crazy? You let me think you were gonna die!
UNK: Yeah, but, Castle, you were so bored over the past couple of weeks,
Beckett : stuck at home with no case to solve,
Beckett : and I saw that this apartment was for rent, and I...
UNK: I thought that I...
Martha : - Richard... - No.
Castle : No. This is,
Castle : without a doubt,
Castle : the greatest birthday gift of my life!
Castle : How did you do it?
Beckett : I did have a lot of help.
Martha : Yes. You did, indeed.
Castle : - You were all in on it? - Mmm-hmm.
Martha : Michael, Brent, Emily, my brilliant acting students.
Martha : I, of course, was the director.
Castle : And the boys?
Esposito : - Yep. - Oh, yeah, they were great.
