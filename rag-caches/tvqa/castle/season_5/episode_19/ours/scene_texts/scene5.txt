Beckett : You've got a long list of indictments against you, Mr. Valentino.
UNK: Assault, racketeering, murder one. And yet, no convictions.
UNK: Tommy Valentino : I'm lucky that way.
Beckett : Yeah, well, your luck's about to run out.
Beckett : I have evidence connecting you
UNK: to payments made to my vic, Clara DeWinter.
Lawyer : My client has no comment.
Valentino : Whoa, whoa, wait. Someone killed Clara?
Beckett : Looks like he does have a comment. So, you're admitting to knowing her?
UNK: Yeah.
Valentino : But I didn't kill her. She was my tax consultant.
Beckett : You paid an IRS agent half a million dollars to act as your tax consultant?
Valentino : You bet your ass. No one's gonna Al Capone me.
Beckett : Okay, if this was a legitimate arrangement,
Beckett : then why did Clara DeWinter
Beckett : go to such lengths to keep that money hidden?
UNK: She hid the money from her husband.
Valentino : That's why she took this job in the first place.
Valentino : She was afraid of him. She needed the money to get away.
UNK: Tommy "The Shark"'s alibi holds.
Beckett : He was with some associates at a nightclub that he owns.
UNK: It doesn't mean he didn't send one of his boys.
UNK: Look, if he killed Clara, he wouldn't have talked to me. No.
UNK: Hiding the money, planning to disappear.
UNK: Something else is going on here.
UNK: So what've you got on the husband?
Ryan : Not much. He's a manager at a big name supermarket in Queens.
Ryan : No priors. Married seven years.
UNK: Oh! And he took a million-dollar life insurance policy out
Ryan : on his wife only three months ago.
UNK: Huh. That's not suspicious.
Esposito : You think he did it and set Renner up?
Beckett : After what happened at the restaurant, it would've been easy.
Beckett : All he'd have to do is rent Renner's same CLS sedan
Beckett : and keep his face hidden.
UNK: While making sure the car was seen.
Beckett : All right. Pick him up.
