UNK: Now you're dead, so you can suck it!
UNK: Richard Castle : You want more?
UNK: Richard Castle : Come get it, buddy, 'cause I got something special for you.
UNK: And I got something special for you, too.
Castle : Well, that's not looking too good.
Beckett : What? Castle...
UNK: Well, then stick your head up, Patel, and get pwned like a real man.
Beckett : Who's Patel?
Castle : He's this kid from India. He's been thrashing me for weeks.
Castle : But not tonight, 'cause tonight I am bringing it.
Castle : It stings, doesn't it?
UNK: Yeah, it kind of does. Castle!
UNK: What?
Beckett : Would you rather play with a kid in an imaginary world,
UNK: or with... In the real world?
UNK: I...
Beckett : Oh, my God!
UNK: What?
Beckett : Oh, my God! You actually have to think about this!
UNK: No.
UNK: No, I don't have to think about it. Come on over here.
Beckett : - Are you kidding me? - What?
Beckett : You know what? Forget it.
Castle : - Seriously, I died on purpose for you. - Whatever.
Castle : Come on. What?
UNK: No, I... It's not my mom, it's worse.
UNK: Yeah. See you Thursday.
Castle : I'm sorry. You know how I get when I'm gaming.
Castle : I was in the zone. I was like Gretzky.
Beckett : Well, at least Gretzky knew how to score.
Castle : Ouch. Okay.
UNK: Look, again, I'm very, very sorry. Do you forgive me?
Beckett : You know, Castle, it wasn't too long ago when me wearing a sexy outfit
Beckett : would get an immediate response from you.
Castle : What are you saying? That I'm taking you for granted?
Beckett : I don't know, Castle. Are you?
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Hey, guys. Victim's over here.
UNK: His name is Arthur Felder, 54.
Ryan : He's a wealthy venture capitalist.
Ryan : Witness said that he took one bite of his squab
Ryan : and did a nose-dive into his plate.
Beckett : Okay, so this was not an allergic reaction?
UNK: Lanie Parish : There's no sign of anaphylaxis.
UNK: Lanie Parish : But his enlarged pupils and excessive saliva
UNK: Lanie Parish : suggest a foreign substance.
Castle : - He was poisoned. - It looks that way.
Lanie : But I won't know for sure until I run a tox screen.
Beckett : So, how many people had access to the food before it was delivered?
UNK: Esposito's checking on that right now.
Castle : Is that Eric Vaughn?
Ryan : Uh, yeah. He was part of the victim's dinner party.
UNK: - He's that billionaire inventor, right? - Yeah.
Castle : Inventor, innovator, and number eight on my LSL.
Castle : - LSL? - Last Supper List.
Castle : You and a table of 12, anyone from history.
Castle : What is mine, you ask? I'm glad you did.
Castle : In order, it is Lincoln, Einstein,
UNK: lan Fleming, John Lennon, Joan of Arc, Sinatra...
Castle : And you, of course.
Beckett : Too late, Castle.
Beckett : So who made the reservation?
UNK: Petra Vasker : I did. About a week ago.
Castle : Did anyone else know that Mr. Felder would be here tonight?
Neil : His office. But I have no idea who they might've told.
Beckett : Mr. Vaughn?
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : Excuse me. Hey.
Eric : Fantastic. Thank you.
Beckett : This is a murder investigation. I'm gonna need your full attention.
Eric : I'm so sorry. That was my pilot.
UNK: Arthur's family's in the Caribbean.
Eric : I was arranging for my plane to bring them home.
UNK: Yeah, well, that's very generous of you, Mr. Vaughn.
UNK: No, please, call me Eric.
Eric : - And you are? - I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
Castle : And I am Richard Castle.
UNK: - Oh, the writer? - Yeah.
Eric : My mother loves your novels.
Castle : I'll get her an autographed copy.
Beckett : So, how well did you know our victim?
