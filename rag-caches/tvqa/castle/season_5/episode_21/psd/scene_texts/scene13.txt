Beckett : Right. So did Arthur Felder. 30 million to be exact.
Beckett : And now it's all gone.
Eric : What is this? A joke?
Beckett : It's not a joke. That's MexiSolar.
Eric : No, no. This is crazy.
UNK: The company's completely solvent. Our factory is state-of-the-art.
Eric : I've seen cash flow reports, signed contracts.
Beckett : You mean, like these? They're fraudulent.
Eric : That's not possible.
Beckett : How is it not possible? You signed them.
UNK: Look, my staff give me dozens of documents to sign every day.
Beckett : It's your company.
UNK: Yes, but I don't oversee the day-to-day.
Beckett : Then who does?
David : That is quite a story, Detective.
Castle : Oh, it is. It's got everything.
Castle : Larceny, betrayal, murder, and you looting millions from MexiSolar.
Beckett : But since you had Eric Vaughn signing off on all of the reports,
Beckett : no one took a hard look at the company.
Castle : Until Arthur Felder wanted to see where his money was going.
Castle : You couldn't have that, could you?
Beckett : You think I killed Arthur Felder?
Beckett : Yes, but it was Vaughn that you wanted dead.
Beckett : You knew that the paper trail would make it look like
Beckett : he had embezzled money from the company.
Beckett : So you hired a hit man, except he killed the wrong guy.
UNK: Oops.
David : You have no proof of any of this.
Beckett : Don't be so sure.
Beckett : The bank that transferred the money to Cindy Paralti captured an IP address.
Beckett : And they traced it back to your computer.
Beckett : It's over, David.
David : Look, I didn't steal that money.
David : I just made some bets with it that underperformed.
