Beckett : What is it, Castle? I was really comfortable on that couch.
Castle : There's something I need to do. Something that you need to see.
UNK: Wait. No...
UNK: I didn't say that I never want you to play your game again.
Castle : No, I know. Don't worry, I have more cords.
Castle : This is just symbolic.
Castle : But you're right. I've been taking you for granted.
Castle : But no longer. Tonight, it's all about me.
Beckett : Shouldn't it be about me?
UNK: Nope, 'cause tonight it's all about me
Castle : giving you a romantic full-body massage.
UNK: Castle...
UNK: Yeah?
Beckett : Where are we going?
Castle : To the bedroom. Come on. You're gonna love this.
