UNK: Okay.
Beckett : It's gonna be fine.
Eric : I know it is.
Eric : I've worked with the best and you'd run circles around any of them.
Eric : Before your first cup of coffee.
Eric : I feel completely safe in your care.
Beckett : After knowing me for just two days?
Eric : No, after knowing you for two minutes.
Beckett : So you think you've got me figured out, huh?
Eric : Except for one thing.
Eric : Are you and Castle...
UNK: Yes.
Eric : Is it serious?
Beckett : Yes. Yeah, you could say it's serious.
Eric : But the truth is, you don't really know. Otherwise you wouldn't have hesitated.
