Castle : - What? - A show that you attended.
Sam : But we worked all that out.
UNK: He was gonna give me half the publishing for that song.
UNK: I was gonna drop the complaint as soon as the papers were signed.
Esposito : That doesn't explain the 25 grand he brought to you.
UNK: Twenty-five... I don't know anything about that.
Sam : Look, he wanted me to write for him.
Sam : It'd be pretty stupid to kill off an employer in this job market.
Castle : You were writing songs for him?
Sam : Yeah. Here, look.
Sam : I already started. I got pretty far on that one.
Esposito : Let me see that.
Esposito : I do like the vocal line on this.
Castle : You read music?
UNK: What, you think 'cause I'm a cop, I can't sing?
Castle : No, I think you can't sing because I've heard you sing.
Esposito : That karaoke machine was busted. I'm gonna sing for y'all later.
Castle : If this was just about writing songs, why all the secrecy?
