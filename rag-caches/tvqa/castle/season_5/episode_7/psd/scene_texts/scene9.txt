Buck : He even gave me a job in his band.
Buck : All I ever did for the guy was teach him how to play guitar.
Castle : You were his teacher?
James : Most guys will tell you that they learned to play guitar themselves,
James : but I had a mentor.
UNK: And that guy was incredible. Much better than I'll ever be.
Interviewer : What's he think of the band?
James : You know, we lost touch a ways back.
James : And sometimes I wonder what he's up to.
Castle : Don't you see?
Castle : Everything we need to solve this murder is right there in that clip.
Castle : Do a hard fade to black.
Castle : Musical sting.
Castle : Buck Cooper was James Swan's musical mentor, right?
Castle : That's why when the filmmaker asked James about his past,
Castle : he automatically thought of his good friend, Buck Cooper,
Castle : and how much he owed him.
Beckett : Which is when he decided to rescue Buck from the compound
Beckett : and bring him on tour.
UNK: But Buck as a roadie didn't seem fitting.
UNK: I mean, he was a better musician than James was, by James' own account.
Beckett : That's what James meant
Beckett : when he told Buck he wanted to make things right.
Keith : He was talking about bringing Buck into the band.
UNK: Exactly.
Castle : That was the change in direction he kept talking about.
UNK: It's why he told Keith it would be good for all of them,
Castle : because Buck is a great musician.
Ryan : Only Swan didn't really mean all of them,
Ryan : because if Buck was in, then someone else was out. But who?
Castle : Esposito, do you still have that sheet music
Castle : that Swan commissioned from the songwriter?
Esposito : - It's right here. - Perfect.
Esposito : Working on the song...
Castle : See? These aren't run-of-the-mill power chords.
Castle : You'd have to be pretty good to play...
Castle : Especially this part.
