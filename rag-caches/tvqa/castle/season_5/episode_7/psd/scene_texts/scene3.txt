UNK: She quit herjob to become a groupie.
UNK: Threw her whole life away.
Joe : I was afraid she was gonna get pregnant, or worse.
Joe : All I wanted to do was grab him. I wanted to scare him a little.
Joe : I wanted him to stay away from her.
Esposito : - Your daughter? - Yes,
Joe : I haven't seen her in weeks.
Joe : I don't even know if she's alive.
Ryan : Does she go by the name of Butterfly?
UNK: Yes.
Ryan : I think we can help you find her, if it's okay with my partner.
Ryan : Well, looks like our stalker was telling the truth.
UNK: Prelim shows that the blood on his overalls was his. Sorry, partner.
UNK: Huh.
UNK: Well, at least grabbing the guy up wasn't a total bust.
UNK: I don't know. Seems to be the definition of a total bust.
UNK: Well, it would've been if I hadn't just spoken to him in holding.
Esposito : Seeing as how he was tailing our victim,
Esposito : he knew exactly where Swan was on the afternoon of his death.
Beckett : Great. Where?
UNK: He was in a bank in SoHo,
Esposito : and then he went into a residential building
Esposito : on the corner of Lafayette and Broome.
Castle : Yes, but why?
Castle : Swan eluded his cameraman to go on a clandestine errand.
Castle : An errand so important he missed a band meeting.
Castle : He was acting erratically, went to the bank right beforehand...
Castle : This all points to one thing.
Ryan : - Drugs. - Drugs... Drugs...
Beckett : That's an interesting theory, but that is pure speculation.
Castle : Actually, it's not.
Castle : Pure speculation would be Swan purchasing thermonuclear technology
Castle : to have a scientist make him an amplifier that went all the way to 12.
Castle : This, musicians buying drugs...
Castle : ...that's just Monday morning's crossword.
Esposito : I'll pull a list of tenants, see if anyone pops.
Beckett : Lanie's got something she wants us to see.
Castle : Lanie? Who's Lanie?
UNK: Uh...
UNK: Uh, Lanie is our medical examiner and she works at the morgue.
