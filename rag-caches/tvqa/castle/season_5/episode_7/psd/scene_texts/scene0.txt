UNK: Kate Beckett : Ryan, get rid of the cameras.
UNK: Yeah, I'll take care of it.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Hey, Officer, we need to lose these cameras.
UNK: You know that. No press allowed!
UNK: No, they're not press. They're shooting some kind of movie.
Hank : No, they're filming a documentary about the band.

UNK: I'm Hank Rogers.
UNK: I'm one of the roadies.
Ryan : You knew the victim? All right, well, I'm gonna need a statement, okay?
UNK: Are you kidding me? They're in here, too.
UNK: Lanie Parish : I asked them to leave, but he said that the director told him to shoot all this.
Esposito : How'd you like to try to film with a cracked lens, huh?
Beckett : All right, Espo, just go get their director, tell him to get the crew out of here.
UNK: Richard Castle : Hey, Esposito.
UNK: Someone didn't get their coffee. What's this?
Lanie : They are making a documentary on the band.
Beckett : Yeah, just ignore them.
Castle : Richard Castle, novelist.
Castle : My latest, Frozen Heat, in stores now.
Castle : Have you met Nikki Heat's inspiration, Detective Beckett?
Beckett : Lanie, what else do we know?
Lanie : Victim is James Swan. He's the lead guitarist of Holy Shemp.
Lanie : They must be Three Stooges fans.
Lanie : Based on lividity,
