Zeke : Yeah, I can play that.
Castle : That's good news, Zeke.
Castle : Because we just so happen to have your bass guitar,
Esposito : right here.
UNK: That's right in my face. A little lower.
Castle : Thank you, L.T.
Zeke : All right, fine. I can't play it.
Zeke : That doesn't prove anything.
Beckett : No, but this does.
Beckett : This is a dry cleaning ticket that we found in your trailer
Beckett : for clothes that you dropped off yesterday.
Beckett : There are still flecks of James Swan's blood on them.
Zeke : Do you know what it's like to play all those crappy street fairs,
Zeke : live on nothing but Ramen noodles, sleep in a van for 14 months?
Zeke : And then he calls me to his trailer after the show and tells me that I'm out?
Zeke : I admit, I might not be the world's greatest bass player. But...
Castle : No, but you sure can handle a guitar.
Zeke : Oh, come on, man! I didn't mean to kill him!
Zeke : We're finally about to hit it big and he wants to Pete Best me?
Zeke : For some roadie? I just...
UNK: Ugh! I just lost it!
UNK: Ugh!
UNK: God! No!
UNK: Kevin Ryan : You know, Pete Best was a drummer.
Castle : I think Stu Sutcliffe would have been a more apt comparison.
Buck : I really appreciate what you guys did for James.
