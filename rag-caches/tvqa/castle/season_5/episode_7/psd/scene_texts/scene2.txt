UNK: They had Swan's blood all over 'em.
UNK: That's not his blood, it's my blood.
Joe : I cut myself when I was working on my van.
Esposito : Oh, come on, Joe. What do you think, we're stupid?
Esposito : We've got you on video, following him for weeks.
Esposito : We've got your van at the crime scene.
Esposito : So why don't you cut the innocent crap right now?
Joe : You want me to admit it? I admit it. I followed him, I did.
Joe : I was just planning to grab him.

UNK: That's not how it happened.
UNK: Not how it happened!
Esposito : That's when you got mad
Esposito : and that's when you busted his head open.
UNK: No, I didn't kill anybody! I just...
Castle : I just...
Joe : I just want my little girl.
Ryan : Your little girl?
Joe : My daughter.
