UNK: Richard Castle : Oh. It's you.
UNK: Who'd you think it was?
Castle : I don't know. I heard rustling.
UNK: And you were gonna fight them off with that?
Castle : This could be very...
UNK: Ow!
Castle : What are you doing here? I thought you weren't coming till next weekend.
Alexis : I had to do laundry. I ran out of clothes.
UNK: Already? It's only been two weeks.
Castle : Not that I'm not thrilled to see you,
Castle : but don't they have washing machines on campus?
Alexis : They're not as nice.
Castle : And by nice, you mean free?
Alexis : - Pretty much. - Right.
Alexis : Uh... You're going to need more orange juice, by the way.
Castle : Thank you.
UNK: Oh! And I finished the ice cream, too.
UNK: And how long have you been here?
Alexis : Ten minutes.
Castle : Wow. Well, as long as you are here,
Castle : how about a Guitar Hero tournament?
Castle : I have been writing all weekend. I could use a break.
Alexis : Oh... Actually, I gotta go.
