Tyson : You ruined it.
Castle : Well, if it's revenge you wanted, why not just kill me?
Tyson : Where's the fun in that?
Tyson : No, no, no. It's more fun to destroy you.
Tyson : Why do you think I let you live that night in the motel?
Tyson : People think it's killing that I like, but murder is just an act.
Tyson : It's all about the anticipation, the planning.
Tyson : Watching you and your daughter taking a walk.
Tyson : You and Beckett making love.
Tyson : Standing in your living room,
Tyson : being inside your life,
Tyson : knowing that I'm going to take it all away from you.
Tyson : That's what I like.
Castle : You won't get away with this.
Tyson : Oh, please.
UNK: What are you going to do? You're gonna tell them that I came here?
Tyson : You think that they're gonna believe the lies of a desperate man?
