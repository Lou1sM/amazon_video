Gates : you're saying you have no alibi?
Castle : I think I'd like my lawyer now.
Martha : Well, this is madness. This is just madness.
Beckett : It's temporary. We just need to find out the truth.
Beckett : Now, can anyone else access your apartment? Does anyone have keys?
Martha : Well, Alicia, the housekeeper.
Alexis : Yeah, but she's been with us for 15 years.
Alexis : And there's a security system.
Alexis : Even if someone had a key, the alarm would go off.
Beckett : Have you noticed anyone out of the ordinary in the building lately?
UNK: A maintenance worker, delivery man?
UNK: Anyone that could've been casing the place?
Martha : No, no, no, no, nothing.
Castle : Thanks. I'll be here.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey.
Beckett : Castle, whoever is behind this,
Beckett : whatever is going on, I will figure this out, I promise.
Castle : I know.
Beckett : In the meantime, you have some visitors.
Alexis : - Dad? - Oh...
Martha : Oh, Richard!
Martha : Oh, darling.
UNK: What?
Ryan : Tech just finished with Castle's computer.
UNK: Parts of it had been wiped, just like Tessa's.
UNK: Were they able to recover anything?
