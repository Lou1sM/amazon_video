Beckett : Yeah, well, sometimes luck is all you need.
Beckett : He can't hide now. We'll find him.
Castle : Thank you.
Beckett : For what?
Castle : Believing in me.
Castle : I mean, given my reputation, my history,
Castle : when you saw those emails, it would've been real easy not to.
Beckett : Yeah, well, things have never been easy between you and me.
Castle : Maybe that's what makes it all worthwhile...
Beckett : It's Tyson! Castle, get down!
UNK: Okay. Come here.
Tyson : Castle! I got your girl!
Tyson : Are you watching? I want you to see this.
UNK: You think I'd let you live? After everything you've done?
Tyson : Castle! Come on, I want you to watch.
Tyson : I want you to watch as I take her life.
Beckett : Over here.
UNK: Water's pretty murky. Haven't seen anything yet.
Beckett : They still haven't found the body.
Castle : They won't. He's not dead.
Beckett : Castle, what are you saying?
Castle : This was never about me. This was about him.
Castle : Those initials in her datebook, he's not that careless.
Castle : He wanted us to find that place.
Castle : He wanted us on this bridge.
