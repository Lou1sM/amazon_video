Castle : so we could help him do what he couldn't do for himself.
UNK: Disappear, so he can start killing again.

Castle : How does a wanted man stop being wanted?
UNK: It has to be public. It has to be final.
Beckett : Do you know how crazy that sounds?
UNK: No one's gonna be looking for him anymore.
