Castle : and how he ruined your lives.
Tim : Yeah. Yeah, I knew.
Castle : - Tim... - It was Ed, Mom.
Tim : He was SunCove. He's the one who bled us dry.
Beth : Ed? Our Ed?
UNK: You must've been pretty angry when you found out.
Tim : Hell, yeah, I was angry.
Tim : When he told me, I wanted to kill him. But I didn't.
Castle : Wait. He told you?
Tim : Yeah. Last week.
Tim : He asked for my forgiveness, and he said he wanted to make things right.
UNK: The lawyer was gonna drop the lawsuit.
UNK: But Ed said he couldn't sit by anymore.
Tim : He knew where there was evidence that could win our case.
Tim : - But he needed my help. - What kind of help?
Tim : I'm good with locks, all right?
Tim : He needed me to slip into the party with the wait staff
UNK: and jimmy-open the storage room door in back.
Beckett : And why didn't you tell us this before?
Tim : Because I couldn't get in trouble again.
Tim : I need to be here for my mom.
Beth : What was in the storage room?
UNK: Files. Boxes of 'em.
UNK: Edmund said that they were original unaltered loan docs from SunCove.
Tim : They were the evidence he needed to set things right.
Beckett : One of his old partners must be at Case Commerce.
Beckett : He recognized Edmund and realized he was going after those files.
Castle : And that's why he needed the helicopter.
Castle : He couldn't exactly cart them out the front door.
Beckett : And with the cops all over the building,
UNK: it would've been risky for the killer to destroy them.
Castle : Which means they're still there.
Beckett : Along with our killer.
Denise : I tried to stop them, but they had a warrant.
Case : What the hell is this all about?
Castle : We were about to ask you the same thing.
Case : I'm telling you, I've never seen those files in my life.
Beckett : So, then what were they doing in your office storage space, Mr. Case?
Case : I don't have the slightest idea.
