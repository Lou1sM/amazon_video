Tim : They were the evidence he needed to set things right.
Beckett : One of his old partners must be at Case Commerce.
Beckett : He recognized Edmund and realized he was going after those files.
Castle : And that's why he needed the helicopter.
Castle : He couldn't exactly cart them out the front door.
Beckett : And with the cops all over the building,
UNK: it would've been risky for the killer to destroy them.
Castle : Which means they're still there.
Beckett : Along with our killer.
Denise : I tried to stop them, but they had a warrant.
Case : What the hell is this all about?
Castle : We were about to ask you the same thing.
Case : I'm telling you, I've never seen those files in my life.
Beckett : So, then what were they doing in your office storage space, Mr. Case?
Case : I don't have the slightest idea.
UNK: Are we really gonna play this game,
Beckett : where you deny things that you and I both know are true?
Beckett : Like you telling me that you didn't know Edmund?
Beckett : We ran a background check.
Beckett : You and Edmund were business associates,
Beckett : so why would you claim that you didn't know him
Beckett : unless you were hiding something?
