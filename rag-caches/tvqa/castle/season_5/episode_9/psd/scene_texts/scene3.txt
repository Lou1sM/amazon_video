Gwenn : and afterwards we stayed up to watch It's a Wonderful Life.
Gwenn : And the next morning he left,
Gwenn : with just the shirt on his back and no explanation.
Beckett : But why would he visit you now?
Gwenn : He wanted me to know how sorry he was for the way he left,
UNK: in case anything happened to him.
Castle : - What did he mean by that? - I don't know what he meant.
UNK: I didn't even know who this man was.
Gwenn : He seemed very nervous and very on edge.
Beckett : Did he give you any indication of what he was afraid of
UNK: or who might've been after him?
Gwenn : After he left, I went to the window to watch him get into the cab.
