Castle : Is it too much to ask to stick to the program?
UNK: Detective Kate Beckett : Well, maybe your program should evolve a little.
Castle : It is evolving. I invited you, didn't I? You are still coming, right?
Beckett : Yeah. I mean, if I don't have to work.
UNK: But look, okay, no presents.
Beckett : Remember, we promised.
