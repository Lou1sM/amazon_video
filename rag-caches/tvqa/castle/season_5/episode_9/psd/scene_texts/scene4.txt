Gwenn : And as the cab pulled away, there was a man on a motorcycle
Gwenn : who was following him.
UNK: We're gonna need you to give us a description of that motorcycle,
Beckett : along with its rider.
Esposito : Early Christmas present from Jenny?
Ryan : Something like that. Would you mind not touching it?
UNK: Ooh.
Esposito : Well, well, well.
Esposito : Now I see what you and Jenny got planned for Christmas Eve.
UNK: Y'all gonna be getting busy.
UNK: Mmm-mmm.
UNK: Ho-ho-ho...
UNK: Uh...
Gates : I take it this is your idea of working the Santa case.
Gates : Detective Esposito,
Gates : you're supposed to be digging up that ATM footage.
Castle : And you are...
UNK: Chasing down that lawyer that our victim had been calling, sir.
Gates : Okay, then.
Gates : Let's finish up this hoochie-coochie thing and get on with it.
Esposito : Yes, sir.
UNK: You're busted.
UNK: Bom-chica-bom-bow.
Beckett : How does a guy on a motorcycle connect to Edmund landing in the park?
Castle : Nothing connects. Why does a man watch a Christmas movie,
Castle : then walk out on everything to become a Santa?
Castle : Unless the key to Edmund's story is It's A Wonderful Life.
Castle : You remember, in the movie,
Castle : George Bailey tried to commit suicide on Christmas Eve
Castle : and was saved by an angel.
Beckett : Which, in our story, is David Dunne.
Castle : Weird casting choice, I know.
Castle : But what if Edmund was trying to jump off a metaphoric bridge,
UNK: you know, to start over?
Castle : As a Santa?
UNK: Yes. Yeah, that's where it falls apart.
Ryan : Actually, it looks like Edmund was way more than just a Santa.
Ryan : I finally got a hold of that lawyer that he'd been calling.
UNK: She'd actually filed a suit on behalf of his neighbors, the Cabots,
