Castle : Oh, that's good.
Beckett : Okay, putting aside the mystery of the helicopter,
Beckett : let's say it is about the clock.
Beckett : How did Edmund know about it? Nobody from the office recognized him.
Castle : Well, maybe he worked the party before.
Esposito : Sorry, bro. I checked.
Esposito : He hasn't. But he sure was determined to work it this year.
Esposito : The agency had booked another Santa to work that party,
Esposito : but someone from Case Commerce called about a week ago to cancel.
Beckett : Let me guess. No one actually called from Case.
UNK: Ding-ding!
Castle : And when he arrived, they assumed he was the Santa they'd hired.
Esposito : Kind of a brilliant scam, really.
UNK: You have access to high-end homes and businesses.
UNK: And who's gonna distrust Santa?
UNK: Uh, his partners, apparently.
Castle : No honor among thieves. Even Santa thieves.
Beckett : All right. Have Robbery send that photo to pawn shops and auction houses.
Beckett : If his partners try to cash in, I wanna know.
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: A man leaves his life and a high paid job to become the neighborhood saint,
UNK: only to get shot dead after stealing a clock
Beckett : that's worth less than your average car.
Beckett : And then he gets thrown out of a helicopter
Beckett : that he didn't even need to be in in the first place.
Beckett : It makes no sense.
Beckett : Given everything that we know about this guy,
Beckett : this is completely out of character.
UNK: Well, sometimes people do inexplicable things.
Beckett : There's an explanation for everything.
Beckett : Is there?
Castle : You volunteered to take Eldin's shift.
Castle : Don't pretend.
Castle : If you aren't ready, why not just tell me?
Beckett : - I'm sorry, Castle. I didn't mean to... - You didn't mean to what?
Beckett : Christmas means something different to me than it does to you.
Castle : It's Christmas. I mean, how can it be different?
