Beckett : Castle, every winter, as soon as that chill rolls in,
Beckett : I'm right back there in that alley.
Beckett : January 9th, and we still hadn't taken our Christmas decorations down.
Beckett : And by the time my dad and I did,
Beckett : it was like we were putting Christmas away forever.
Beckett : We haven't opened those boxes since.
Castle : I didn't know.
Beckett : That's why every year my dad goes up to his cabin.
Beckett : And ever since I became a rookie, I have taken the Christmas shift.
Beckett : Because I know that there are families out there
Beckett : that are celebrating together in their homes
Beckett : and I am keeping watch, and that is my tradition.
Beckett : And that is important to me.
Beckett : It's as important as your tradition is to you.
Beckett : And I'm sorry, Castle, I thought I could let that go, but I...
Gwenn : I understand.
