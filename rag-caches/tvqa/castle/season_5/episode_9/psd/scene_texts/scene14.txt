UNK: Uh...
Receptionist : - Merry Christmas. - You, too.
UNK: Yo, what are you still doing here?
Esposito : Shouldn't you be at home, stuffing your wife's stocking?
Ryan : - I don't think I'm ready, Javi. - For what? Sex?
Ryan : No, for what sex leads to.
Ryan : We were putting up the tree the other day,
Ryan : Jenny says to me,
UNK: "It just doesn't feel like Christmas without kids."
Ryan : She wants to try.
Ryan : But I come to work,
UNK: I watch the news, and every day it seems like the world's falling apart.
Ryan : How am I supposed to bring a kid into that?
Esposito : The world's always falling apart, bro. Since the beginning of time.
Esposito : But having kids, making a family, that's what keeps it together.
Esposito : So go home.
Esposito : Make a baby. You're ready.
Ryan : Yeah. Thanks, bro.
Receptionist : - Merry Christmas. - Yeah. Merry Christmas.
Lanie : - Mmm. - Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Mother, the glogg is excellent.
Castle : - And everything looks excellent. - Thank you.
Castle : Just like always.
Martha : Oh, Richard. Richard, darling, you don't have to look so miserable.
UNK: - Oh, no... - She's right, Dad.
Alexis : We know how much this tradition means to you,
Alexis : so we both decided to cancel our plans.
Alexis : We're here all night, like always.
Castle : I love you both so much that you would do that for me.
Castle : But I was wrong about tonight.
UNK: There's someplace I need to be.
Alexis : - Dad, I... - Go.
Martha : Go, go, go.
UNK: Aw!
UNK: Uh...
Castle : - I was just coming to see you. - I was coming to see you.
