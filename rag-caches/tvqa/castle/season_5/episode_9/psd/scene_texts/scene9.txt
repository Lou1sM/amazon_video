UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Yeah, so I got a custodian who was up on the roof last night for a smoke.
Beckett : Did he see anything?
Ryan : It's not what he saw. It's what he found.
UNK: The place was cleaned earlier in the day, but when he got up there,
Ryan : there was trash blown all over the helipad.
Ryan : Probably from the rotor wash when it took off.
Beckett : What kind of trash?
Ryan : The kind that looked like someone had been waiting for someone.
UNK: A soda can, candy wrappers and an empty pouch of pipe tobacco.
Dunne : Pipe tobacco.
Castle : Now, who do we know that smokes a pipe and flies?
UNK: And remember, when you go out there,
Dunne : Santa does not enter through the chimney,
Dunne : he enters through the heart.
Esposito : What about through a helicopter?
