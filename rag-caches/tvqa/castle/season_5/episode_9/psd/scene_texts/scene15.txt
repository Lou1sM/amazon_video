Castle : What about your shift?
Beckett : I got Karpowski to cover. What about your family tradition?
UNK: Um...
Castle : I was just thinking it's time for a new tradition.
Castle : Me, too.
UNK: Oh, for God sakes, Richard. Invite the girl in.
Castle : - Right. Would you... - Yeah.
Beckett : It's beautiful.
Receptionist : Merry Christmas.
Castle : - I didn't get you anything. - What?
UNK: Ms. Cabot, I'm Detective Esposito.
Esposito : I have something that I think belongs to you.
Esposito : We found out that your husband put that up for collateral
Esposito : against the mortgage on your house.
Beth : I haven't seen this for so long.
Beth : It was handed down through his family for generations.
Esposito : I think that's why Edmund took it. He wanted you to have it back.
Gates : Thank you.
UNK: Oh, wait.
Beth : Why don't you come inside? We're just having dinner.
UNK: Okay.
