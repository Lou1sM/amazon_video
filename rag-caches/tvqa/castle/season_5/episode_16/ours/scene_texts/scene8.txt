UNK: Ow!
Castle : Wait. Okay, wait. Just...
Castle : What do you want?
UNK: Whoa, uh-uh!
Hunt : If I'd wanted you dead,
Hunt : you'd be dead.
Castle : You're the guy in the sketch. You were at the farmhouse.
Hunt : That's right.
Hunt : Your friend there was pretty good.
UNK: But a bit out of his league.
UNK: I am not surprised that he crossed to the other side.
Castle : You know what's going on here? Do you know where my daughter is?
UNK: Look, we're exposed here. We gotta go now.
Castle : Go? What are you talking about?
Castle : Go where?
Hunt : Somewhere safe. Get in the car.
Castle : No. Not until you tell me what's going on.
Castle : Beckett, I am so glad you called.
UNK: Castle,
Beckett : Alexis wasn't taken by accident. She was the target.
Beckett : They wanted her.
Castle : Listen, I...
Castle : What are you doing?
UNK: That was a $200 phone!
UNK: And that's how they track you.
Hunt : Now get in the car.
Castle : Hey, I am not getting in the car!
Hunt : Don't be an idiot. I'm the good guy.
Castle : Oh, you expect me to trust you?
Hunt : You're still alive, aren't you?
UNK: What are you gonna do,
Hunt : stay out here in the woods with all the dead guys?
Castle : Fine. I'll get in the car.
Hunt : Given how you're feeling so bad about your 200-buck phone,
Hunt : you might want to pick up that three-million-dollar briefcase.
Hunt : Take it with you.
UNK: Ew.
Castle : At least tell me your name.
Hunt : Hunt. Jackson Hunt.
Castle : Sounds made up.
Gaston : It is.
