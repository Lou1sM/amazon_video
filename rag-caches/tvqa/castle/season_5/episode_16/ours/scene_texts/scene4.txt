UNK: Jacque Henri : Sometimes the Lord needs a little help, huh?
Castle : Thank you for coming.
Henri : Don't thank me yet.
Henri : My terms.
Henri : Half now, half when I find her.
Castle : Can you find her?
UNK: Yes.
Henri : But I don't promise to find her alive.
Henri : That, I'm afraid, is out of my control.
Castle : Where do we start?
Henri : I understand there is a recording of a call she made to you.
Castle : How did you...
Castle : Yeah, there's a recording.
UNK: I'll need a copy.
Castle : There's nothing on it that indicates where she is.
Henri : And who told you that?
Castle : The FBI.
UNK: Well, then you thank God I am not the FBI.
UNK: Come.
Castle : Where are we going?
Henri : To see a friend.
UNK: The Mole : Bonjour, Henri.
UNK: Bonjour.
UNK: The Mole : Monsieur Castle, I presume.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : And you are?
UNK: We call him La Taupe. The Mole.
UNK: What?
UNK: He says you're nervous. He can hear your heart.
UNK: What's outside the window?
UNK: Nothing, I can't see anything, the windows are covered up.
UNK: They're coming. They're coming. They found out we're gone.
Castle : Baby, get out of there. Get out of there now!
Gaston : I told you.
Castle : There's nothing on there. Nothing to see or hear.
UNK: The Mole : You listen with your eyes. Shh.
Castle : Get out of there. Get out of there now!
UNK: The Mole : There! Hear that?
UNK: No.
UNK: The Mole : Right there.
UNK: The Mole : Church bells.
UNK: St. George's, in the Sixteenth.
UNK: The Mole : From the sound of it,
UNK: she is six, maybe eight blocks away.
UNK: The Mole : And there's a restaurant in the building she's in.
Castle : How can you tell that?
UNK: The Mole : Sounds, Monsieur Castle, are like fingerprints.
UNK: The Mole : No two are alike.
UNK: The Mole : That hum?
UNK: It's from a restaurant ventilation system, commercial grade.
Henri : When was the last time you slept?
Castle : I don't know. I'm good.
Henri : This will take some time.
Henri : I will wake you when we find something.
UNK: What's outside the window?
UNK: Nothing, I can't see anything,
UNK: the windows are covered up.
Alexis : They're coming. They're coming.
UNK: They found out we're gone.
Castle : Baby, get out of there. Get out of there now!
UNK: Ms. DeGarmo, I'm gonna ask you again.
Beckett : What else can you tell me about Roger Henson's murder?
UNK: Pauline Degarmo : I don't have to tell you nothing. I know my rights.
UNK: Pauline Degarmo : You can't keep me here.
Beckett : He's dead.
UNK: Tortured.
Beckett : I'm just trying to find the people that did it to him.
UNK: Listen, bitch. I don't talk to cops.
Pauline : Now go get me my lawyer, and then go to hell.
Beckett : Do you have any idea what this is all about?
Beckett : You think I'm some beat cop busting you on possession charges?
Beckett : My partner's daughter is missing, and you...
Beckett : ...are in my way.
Beckett : Now you don't talk to cops?
Beckett : I'm not a cop today, honey.
Beckett : Who was he working for?
Pauline : He didn't say!
UNK: - Who is this guy? - I don't know.
UNK: What?
Pauline : But Roger got strange calls in the middle of the night.
Pauline : People with accents.
Beckett : - What kind of accents? - Foreign.
Beckett : What phone did he use?
Pauline : He didn't give me the number!
Beckett : Good. I believe you.
UNK: Now you're gonna give me his address.
Esposito : Looks like somebody got here first.
Beckett : These people hired him to kidnap those girls.
Beckett : So why would they torture and murder him?
Beckett : Why would they toss this place?
