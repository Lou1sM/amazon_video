Castle : Tell me what you need.
Hunt : Where she's being held,
Hunt : there's a conduit supplying it that runs through the old sewer system.
Hunt : You cut those cables, you cut their power, lights, alarm, security video.
Hunt : That conduit's the key.
Hunt : What do you say, kid?
Hunt : You've been playing cop for years.
Hunt : You ready to play spy?
UNK: How we doing?
Castle : Yeah, I'm almost there.
Hunt : You should see a junction box with six conduits coming from it.
Castle : I see it.
UNK: Now, the one you want is the third one from the bottom.
Castle : Got it.
Hunt : Wrap the charge around it, like I showed you,
Hunt : and then attach the detonator.
Castle : All right, I'm setting the detonator for 30 seconds,
UNK: now.
UNK: Hey!
Henri : Don't move.
Castle : We may have a problem.
UNK: Dad?
UNK: Dad?
Castle : Alexis. Alexis?
Alexis : - Dad? Dad? - Alexis.
Castle : Alexis, hey.
Castle : You okay?
Alexis : Yeah, but what are you doing here?
UNK: Did they kidnap you, too?
UNK: Uh...
Castle : Yeah, trying to rescue you.
Alexis : - You shouldn't be here. - Shh.
Castle : It's okay. We're together.
UNK: It's gonna be okay.
UNK: Hey, you look good.
Volkov : You are like your father, Mr. Castle.
Volkov : Getting involved where you don't belong.
Volkov : Did he really think I would not be prepared for an attack?
Alexis : Dad, what's he talking about?
Volkov : Tell her.
UNK: Go on. Tell her why she's here.
UNK: You have me now.
Castle : She's of no use to you. Let her go.
Volkov : When a man doubles his wealth,
Volkov : why should he give half of it away?
Guard : He had this on him.
Volkov : Time to end this.
Volkov : I know that you are here.
Volkov : I know that you are close.
Volkov : And I want you to know that I have your son.
Volkov : You have 10 seconds to show yourself to my men out front.
Volkov : Give yourself up,
Volkov : or I will kill him.
UNK: Dad.
Castle : It's okay.
UNK: Ten,
UNK: nine,
UNK: eight,
UNK: - seven... - I'm sorry.
Castle : - It's all right. ...six...
UNK: ...five... - Dad...
UNK: ...four,
UNK: three...
UNK: You're not gonna kill my son, Volkov.
UNK: No?
Volkov : And why is that?
Hunt : Because you'll be dead.
Castle : Get down!
Hunt : Once the charge goes off, there'll be a moment
Hunt : when it all hits the fan.
Hunt : Use this to get her out.
Castle : Watch your eyes, sweetheart.
Hunt : And then run.
Martha : Come on.
