UNK: Tech Guy : It's been erased, and not with commercial software.
Beckett : Were you able to pull anything from it?
UNK: Tech Guy : I'll do what I can, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Henri : Do it.
Beckett : We gotta figure out what he was looking for.
UNK: The Mole : Don't worry.
UNK: The Mole : Henri always comes through.
Castle : Shouldn't he be back by now?
Castle : He is.
Castle : Was she there?
UNK: Yes. And she is safe.
Henri : This is today's paper.
Castle : Why did they take her?
Henri : It was convenient. But they've agreed to let her go.
Castle : - When? - Later today.
Henri : In the forest of Fontainebleau.
UNK: That will give you time to get the money together.
UNK: Tech Guy : Detective Beckett!
UNK: Tech Guy : Henson was looking at these.
UNK: Tech Guy : Surveillance photos.
Beckett : Oh, God, Alexis.
Beckett : She wasn't at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Beckett : She was the target.
Castle : Where's Alexis? I don't see her.
Henri : Stay calm.
UNK: Oh, no, no, this isn't right.
Castle : It's not right.
Henri : Don't move.
Castle : You're selling me out? Why?
Henri : I value my life more than my word.
UNK: If I'd known who was really holding your daughter,
Henri : who your daughter really is...
UNK: Who she really is? I don't understand.
UNK: ...I would never have taken the job.
Castle : She's nobody.
