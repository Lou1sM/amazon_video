Volkov : Give yourself up,
Volkov : or I will kill him.
UNK: Dad.
Castle : It's okay.
UNK: Ten,
UNK: nine,
UNK: eight,
UNK: - seven... - I'm sorry.
Castle : - It's all right. ...six...
UNK: ...five... - Dad...
UNK: ...four,
UNK: three...
UNK: You're not gonna kill my son, Volkov.
UNK: No?
Volkov : And why is that?
Hunt : Because you'll be dead.
Castle : Get down!
Hunt : Once the charge goes off, there'll be a moment
Hunt : when it all hits the fan.
Hunt : Use this to get her out.
Castle : Watch your eyes, sweetheart.
Hunt : And then run.
Martha : Come on.
Hunt : His men will move to the front to respond to my attack.
Hunt : You move to the back,
Hunt : through these doors, and right down this corridor.
UNK: And what about his men? What if they try to stop us?
Hunt : Don't let them.
UNK: Hunt voiceover : Just keep moving until you hit the back door
UNK: 'cause I'll be coming in the front.
UNK: Hunt voiceover : Don't stop running, ever.
UNK: Hunt voiceover : Not until you reach the U.S. Embassy.
Hunt : And once you reach the Embassy,
Hunt : ask for Deputy Chief of Missions Jim Aldacott.
Hunt : He'll provide you both with an official cover story.
Hunt : One that credits Interpol and the French police
Hunt : and doesn't include me.
Castle : What happens to you after?
Hunt : Assuming we're both not killed? I disappear.
Castle : No, but we just...
Hunt : That's the job. That's my life.
UNK: Yeah, but we just met.
Castle : I mean, I got a lot of questions. A lot of things I wanna say.
UNK: Anwar El-masri : I don't...
Castle : I need to have more time.
Hunt : Maybe we can do that sometime. Some day.
Castle : How will I know if you made it?
Hunt : Oh, you won't. Not officially, at least.
Hunt : I know this has been tough for you, Richard,
Hunt : and I just want you to know, son,
Hunt : I've always been proud of you.
