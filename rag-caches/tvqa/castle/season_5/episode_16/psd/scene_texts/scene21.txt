UNK: The Mole : Bonjour, Henri.
UNK: Bonjour.
UNK: The Mole : Monsieur Castle, I presume.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : And you are?
UNK: We call him La Taupe. The Mole.
UNK: What?
UNK: He says you're nervous. He can hear your heart.
UNK: What's outside the window?
UNK: Nothing, I can't see anything, the windows are covered up.
UNK: They're coming. They're coming. They found out we're gone.
Castle : Baby, get out of there. Get out of there now!
Gaston : I told you.
Castle : There's nothing on there. Nothing to see or hear.
UNK: The Mole : You listen with your eyes. Shh.
Castle : Get out of there. Get out of there now!
