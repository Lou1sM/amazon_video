UNK: she is six, maybe eight blocks away.
UNK: The Mole : And there's a restaurant in the building she's in.
Castle : How can you tell that?
UNK: The Mole : Sounds, Monsieur Castle, are like fingerprints.
UNK: The Mole : No two are alike.
UNK: The Mole : That hum?
UNK: It's from a restaurant ventilation system, commercial grade.
Henri : When was the last time you slept?
Castle : I don't know. I'm good.
Henri : This will take some time.
Henri : I will wake you when we find something.

UNK: Nothing, I can't see anything,
UNK: the windows are covered up.
Alexis : They're coming. They're coming.
UNK: They found out we're gone.
Castle : Baby, get out of there. Get out of there now!
