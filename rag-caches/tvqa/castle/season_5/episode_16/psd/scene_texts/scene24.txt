Pauline : Now go get me my lawyer, and then go to hell.
Beckett : Do you have any idea what this is all about?
Beckett : You think I'm some beat cop busting you on possession charges?
Beckett : My partner's daughter is missing, and you...
Beckett : ...are in my way.
Beckett : Now you don't talk to cops?
Beckett : I'm not a cop today, honey.
Beckett : Who was he working for?
Pauline : He didn't say!
UNK: - Who is this guy? - I don't know.
UNK: What?
Pauline : But Roger got strange calls in the middle of the night.
Pauline : People with accents.
Beckett : - What kind of accents? - Foreign.
Beckett : What phone did he use?
Pauline : He didn't give me the number!
Beckett : Good. I believe you.
UNK: Now you're gonna give me his address.
Esposito : Looks like somebody got here first.
Beckett : These people hired him to kidnap those girls.
Beckett : So why would they torture and murder him?
Beckett : Why would they toss this place?
Esposito : Maybe it wasn't the same guys.
Beckett : Who else is it gonna be?
Beckett : Check with the neighbors. See if they saw anything.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Beckett. Computer.
Beckett : Get it to Tech.
UNK: Have them tear it apart. Find me something.
UNK: Anything.
Beckett : What's going on?
Castle : You found something?
UNK: Maybe.
Henri : Acoustic tiles, office space close to a rooftop.
Henri : Might fit the bill.
Castle : - I'm coming. - No, no, no.
Henri : - It might not be the place. - I don't care.
UNK: It could be the place.
Castle : My daughter, my money. I'm coming.
Castle : They were here.
Henri : Not anymore.
