Martha : Thank God.
Martha : Is there any news?
Beckett : No, not yet. But we are doing everything that we can.
Martha : Well, where's Richard?
Beckett : I thought that he was with you.
UNK: No. He told me he was gonna be with you, working on the case.
Beckett : Martha, I haven't seen him all day.
Martha : Oh, no.
Beckett : - What? - No!
Martha : It's gone.
Beckett : What's gone?
UNK: It's so stupid. It's just stupid.
Beckett : Martha, what's going on?
UNK: Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
UNK: Castle.
Martha : Richard, where are you?
Castle : I'm at the precinct with Beckett. Why?
Martha : Don't lie to me, Richard.
Martha : Beckett is here, your passport is gone.
Martha : Now what the hell do you think you're doing?
Castle : Getting my daughter back.
Esposito : Paris? What the hell is he doing in Paris?
Beckett : He thinks that he can find her.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : What, so he's Liam Neeson, now?
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Liam Neeson? Dude's barely Ashley Judd.
UNK: In the state that he's in, who knows what he's capable of?
Beckett : But he says that he knows someone that can help.
Esposito : You gonna go after him?
Beckett : And lose a day flying out there, and another one tracking him down
Beckett : in a place that I don't have jurisdiction or authority?
UNK: No.
UNK: Look, he's acting like a father,
UNK: and I have to act like a cop.
