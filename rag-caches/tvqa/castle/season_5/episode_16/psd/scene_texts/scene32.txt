Castle : Go? What are you talking about?
Castle : Go where?
Hunt : Somewhere safe. Get in the car.
Castle : No. Not until you tell me what's going on.
Castle : Beckett, I am so glad you called.
UNK: Castle,
Beckett : Alexis wasn't taken by accident. She was the target.
Beckett : They wanted her.
Castle : Listen, I...
Castle : What are you doing?
UNK: That was a $200 phone!
UNK: And that's how they track you.
Hunt : Now get in the car.
Castle : Hey, I am not getting in the car!
Hunt : Don't be an idiot. I'm the good guy.
Castle : Oh, you expect me to trust you?
Hunt : You're still alive, aren't you?
UNK: What are you gonna do,
Hunt : stay out here in the woods with all the dead guys?
Castle : Fine. I'll get in the car.
Hunt : Given how you're feeling so bad about your 200-buck phone,
Hunt : you might want to pick up that three-million-dollar briefcase.
Hunt : Take it with you.
UNK: Ew.
Castle : At least tell me your name.
Hunt : Hunt. Jackson Hunt.
Castle : Sounds made up.
Gaston : It is.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Hey!
Alexis : Can someone just please tell me what's going on?
Alexis : Why am I here?
Hunt : We should be safe here for now.
Castle : Where did you get these?
UNK: That's not important.
Hunt : Now what's important is we get her back.
Castle : I don't even know you. Why would you care?
Hunt : It's my job. I was sent.
UNK: By whom? The El-Masris?
Hunt : What's the difference?
Castle : You need to tell me who hired you
Castle : and why these people took my daughter.
Hunt : That's yours.
Hunt : You want to get it?
Castle : How's it mine? You shot mine.
UNK: It's a clone. It's how I tracked you.
Hunt : Difference is, that one's secure.
Hunt : It's probably Beckett.
Hunt : You ought to let her know you're safe.
Castle : It's not Beckett. It's a local number.
Castle : Alexis. Alexis?
UNK: Gregor Volkov : I'm afraid not, Mr. Castle.
UNK: Gregor Volkov : But I am the one holding her.
UNK: Gregor Volkov : If you value her life,
UNK: Gregor Volkov : you will give the phone to the man standing next to you.
UNK: Gregor Volkov : The one responsible for all the bloodshed in the woods.
