Hunt : Because I was careless.
UNK: Because, somehow, he found out who she was, who you were,
Hunt : and he knew I'd come for her.
Castle : Why? Why would you come for her?
UNK: Because she's my granddaughter.
UNK: Richard,
Hunt : I'm your father.
Castle : You're telling me you're a spy?
UNK: "Intelligence asset" is the term.
Castle : My dad's a spy.
Castle : Does my mom know?
UNK: Mmm-mmm.
Hunt : What'd she tell you about me?
Castle : Uh... That it was a special night,
Castle : she was in love,
Castle : she woke up the next morning, you were gone.
Castle : She never saw you again.
UNK: You know, that night,
UNK: I'd just finished a job at the UN.
Hunt : At least I thought I had.
UNK: And the next day things went south.
Hunt : I had to get out of the city fast.
Hunt : It was a year before I was stateside again.
Hunt : That's when I found out about you.
Castle : You've known about me, about us, all of these years,
Castle : and you never once let us know you were out there?
Hunt : What I do means no communication, no relationships, to anyone.
Hunt : But, hey, I've been around. We've met before.
UNK: Yeah.
