Harris : Mr. El-Masri, you have to let me contact the local authorities.
UNK: No! They were clear.
Anwar : They see police, my daughter dies.
Anwar : We'll pay to get her back.
Castle : Did they...
Castle : Did they say anything about Alexis?
Lina : Anwar insisted.
Lina : And they've agreed to release both our daughters.
Castle : If there is anything I owe you...
Anwar : You owe me nothing.
Gates : If the police aren't involved, then who's making the drop?
