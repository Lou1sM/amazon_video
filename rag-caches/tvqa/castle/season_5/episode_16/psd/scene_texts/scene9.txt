Castle : To tell my mother. She doesn't know yet.
Beckett : I'll go with.
UNK: No.
Castle : I need to do this alone.
Harris : Castle may be right.
Harris : Sara was the objective. Alexis is just a liability now.
Beckett : Then why didn't they bring her to the exchange?
Harris : Same reason they took her. A bargaining chip.
Harris : Insurance in case something went wrong.
Gates : Insurance they don't need anymore.
Harris : We'll keep moving forward,
Harris : but we have to manage expectations now.
Beckett : Agent Harris, I'm not going to manage expectations.
Beckett : I'll be solving a murder.
Beckett : The girls' kidnapper, Roger Henson, was tortured and killed,
Beckett : most likely by the people that hired him.
Beckett : We find those people, we will find Alexis.
Beckett : Castle, it's me again. Can you just call me when you get this?
UNK: He's still not answering?
