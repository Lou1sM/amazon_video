UNK: 12 years ago in an operation here in Paris.
Hunt : The first time he came after me,
UNK: I put him away in a Chechen prison for life.
UNK: Then he escaped and he's been trying to figure out a way
Hunt : to draw me out ever since.
Castle : If this was about Alexis, why would he take the other girl?
Hunt : Because if he just took Alexis, it wouldn't be international news.
UNK: He needed somebody high-profile.
Hunt : He needed me to know.
Hunt : And now he's got me exactly where he wants me.
Hunt : If I don't show up tomorrow, he will kill her.
Castle : And if you do show up?
Hunt : He'll kill us both just for fun.
Castle : If you know me at all, you know I'll do anything.
Hunt : You know, our only advantage is Volkov doesn't know I've found him.
Hunt : He may not be prepared for a direct assault.
Hunt : If I can get inside his compound, I can get Alexis out.
Hunt : A direct assault?
Hunt : This is our best shot, her best shot.
Hunt : But we need a tactical advantage.
UNK: See, I can't do this alone.
Castle : Tell me what you need.
Hunt : Where she's being held,
Hunt : there's a conduit supplying it that runs through the old sewer system.
Hunt : You cut those cables, you cut their power, lights, alarm, security video.
Hunt : That conduit's the key.
Hunt : What do you say, kid?
Hunt : You've been playing cop for years.
Hunt : You ready to play spy?
UNK: How we doing?
Castle : Yeah, I'm almost there.
Hunt : You should see a junction box with six conduits coming from it.
Castle : I see it.
UNK: Now, the one you want is the third one from the bottom.
Castle : Got it.
Hunt : Wrap the charge around it, like I showed you,
Hunt : and then attach the detonator.
Castle : All right, I'm setting the detonator for 30 seconds,
UNK: now.
UNK: Hey!
Henri : Don't move.
Castle : We may have a problem.
UNK: Dad?
UNK: Dad?
Castle : Alexis. Alexis?
Alexis : - Dad? Dad? - Alexis.
Castle : Alexis, hey.
Castle : You okay?
Alexis : Yeah, but what are you doing here?
UNK: Did they kidnap you, too?
UNK: Uh...
Castle : Yeah, trying to rescue you.
Alexis : - You shouldn't be here. - Shh.
Castle : It's okay. We're together.
UNK: It's gonna be okay.
UNK: Hey, you look good.
Volkov : You are like your father, Mr. Castle.
Volkov : Getting involved where you don't belong.
Volkov : Did he really think I would not be prepared for an attack?
Alexis : Dad, what's he talking about?
Volkov : Tell her.
UNK: Go on. Tell her why she's here.
UNK: You have me now.
Castle : She's of no use to you. Let her go.
Volkov : When a man doubles his wealth,
Volkov : why should he give half of it away?
Guard : He had this on him.
