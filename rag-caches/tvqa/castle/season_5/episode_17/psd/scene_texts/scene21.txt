Beckett : So, according to Amanda's psych records,
Beckett : she suffered a mental break about a year ago.
Castle : That must be when she started fixating on revenge,
Castle : planning to punish all those who wrongly ID'd her dad.
UNK: You know, she must've cozied up to Val to find out where Jason and Mark were.
Esposito : And she used this to knock them out.
Castle : The mug?
UNK: No, the taser. It's a modified taser.
UNK: It emits a disorienting light and amplified voltage.
Beckett : Enough voltage to stop a heart.
Esposito : And make the facial muscles contract.
Castle : I guess Amanda wanted the people responsible for her father's death
Castle : to suffer the same way he did.
Beckett : So, three days of fear capped with a dark, heart-stopping death.
Esposito : Yeah, but how did she get the power to go out?
Esposito : She used this.
Beckett : She attached it to the cabin's circuit breaker.
Beckett : It emits a magnetic charge that interferes with the system.
Beckett : So, I guess that there is a logical explanation for everything.
Castle : Oh, I don't know. What about Nigel?
Castle : How did his body go missing from his grave?
Ryan : I can answer that. Turns out he was never buried.
Ryan : His body disappeared from the morgue shortly after his death.
