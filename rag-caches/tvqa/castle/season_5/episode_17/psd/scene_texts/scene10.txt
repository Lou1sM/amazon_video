UNK: Uh, yes, that young lady did stop by a few days ago.
Beckett : Do you have any idea what they talked about,
UNK: or what he might've said to her?
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : I'm afraid not, dear. You'll have to ask Mr. Malloy yourself.
Castle : You know, not for nothing, but what's he like?
Castle : I mean, on a scale of one to Hannibal Lecter,
Castle : what are we dealing with here?
UNK: I'm sorry, but doctor-patient privilege
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : prohibits us from characterizing or describing our patients' behavior.
Beckett : No, that's okay. We understand.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : Here we are. Let's go over the rules.
UNK: Please don't hand him any objects or take anything from him.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : Don't stand too close to the glass.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : If you need any help, just press the red button on the wall behind you.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : Okay? Now, please, just sign here,
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : acknowledging that you understand the rules.
UNK: Ew.
Castle : I feel like I'm signing my life away.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : Well, let's hope not.
UNK: All right, thank you.
UNK: Leopold Malloy : Please, have a seat. I so rarely receive visitors.
Beckett : But you have received a visitor recently.
Beckett : Val Butler.
Beckett : Why was she here?
UNK: Oh, sweet girl. She came to ask me if I'd sent her something.
Castle : And did you?
Leopold : How could I? I can't send anything to anyone.
UNK: You could've just gotten someone else to send it to her,
UNK: just like you could've gotten someone else to kill her.
Leopold : And why would I do such a thing?
Beckett : To perpetuate the myth of your brother's immortality.
Beckett : Or to avenge his death.
