Beckett : Mr. Heller, I'm Detective Beckett. NYPD.
Mark : Well, then you won't mind showing me ID.
Mark : Can't be too cautious.
Mark : Not with Malloy witnesses dropping like flies.
Beckett : Look, we know about the disc.
Beckett : We're here to take you to the precinct where we can protect you.
Mark : You can't protect me. He's back.
Castle : Look, Mark, if the pattern holds, you got two minutes before,
Beckett : you know, so let's talk about this in the car.
UNK: You know, just being in the same courtroom as Malloy
Mark : was enough to make a grown man wet himself.
Mark : Psycho yammering about death and rebirth and all that hoo-ha.
Castle : Okay, hoo-ha, we can be talking about...
Mark : You know, neither me nor Val nor Jason
Mark : wanted to testify against him or the other guy.
UNK: What do you mean "the other guy"? Are you talking about Leopold?
Mark : Oh, God.
Castle : Time's up.
Castle : It's here.
Castle : Do you think it'll matter that we still have a day left?
UNK: Or will it be like a "three birds with one stone" thing?
Beckett : Where are your circuit breakers?
Mark : Outside, by the tool shed.
Beckett : Someone's out there.
UNK: Seriously?
UNK: What's it like? Is it ghastly? Pale? Pissed?
