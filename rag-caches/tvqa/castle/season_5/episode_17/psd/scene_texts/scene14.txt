UNK: I think the guy's crazy, but he was right about one thing.
Esposito : He has no phone, no email and no visitors besides Val.
Beckett : There's gotta be some way of proving that Leopold's behind all this.
Esposito : I can't tell you how he did it, but I can tell you who's next.
Esposito : I checked into the court documents on the Malloy trial.
Esposito : I noticed a pattern.
Esposito : Jason was the first person to testify, and he was also the first one to die.
Esposito : A day later, Val, the second person to testify, was killed.
Beckett : Okay, so they're being killed in order of their testimonies.
Castle : Who's lucky number three?
UNK: Uh, Mark Heller. I talked to his girlfriend.
Esposito : He received a disc three days ago.
Castle : That means he's due to die tonight at midnight. That's in four hours.
UNK: - And where's Mark Heller now? - That's the problem.
Esposito : He watched the video, he freaked out and left the house.
Esposito : - Nobody knows where he went. - I might.
