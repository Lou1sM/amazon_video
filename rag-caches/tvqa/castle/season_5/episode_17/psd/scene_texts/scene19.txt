Mark : Before Nigel, the police arrested someone else.
Mark : David Collier. The guy had a history of mental illness.
Mark : Me, Val and Jason had to pick him out of a lineup.
Mark : None of us were sure, but the police, they...
Castle : They pressured you into saying it was Collier.
Castle : What happened to him?
Mark : He couldn't take it.
Mark : The accusations, what people were saying.
Mark : He smashed a light bulb in his cell,
UNK: and he used the wire to electrocute himself.
Castle : So his heart stopped.
Castle : When did he die? Mark, exactly when did he die?
Castle : At midnight. Third night he was in prison.
UNK: "You saw. Midnight, third day, you die."
Castle : This isn't about Nigel. It's about Collier.
Castle : Mark, you gotta think. Did he have any friends, any relatives?
Mark : Yeah, he had a daughter, Amanda.
Castle : Val's roommate's name is Amanda.
Castle : Someone's here.
Amanda : Your three days are up, Mark.
Amanda : The same three days of fear my father had.
