Tommy : So he couldn't have sent that package unless it was from the great beyond.
Ryan : The box was last rented by an Andrew Levine,
Ryan : who died of liver failure three months ago.
Ryan : Somehow I don't think he's connected to this case.
Beckett : So the killer covered his tracks.
Beckett : He must have written a random P.O. Box on the packaging slip.
Val : - Or... - No!
UNK: Ryan! There is no "or."
Castle : Maybe we should make a copy of the DVD and send it to someone else.
Castle : That's how they saved people in The Ring.
Ryan : Yeah, but all those people who got a copy died.
Esposito : Yeah, and you'd just be passing the buck off to someone else.
Esposito : That's cold, bro.
Castle : Okay, does anyone have a better solution? Because we need one.
Castle : If not for me, at least for Beckett.
Beckett : Castle, that's so sweet. You want me to outlive you?
Castle : Of course.
UNK: Who else is gonna tell my tale of sacrifice and selflessness?
Beckett : Okay, we won't be telling anyone anything.
UNK: We're both gonna be fine.
Castle : How can you say that when we have not one but two dead DVD watchers?
Beckett : There's gotta be a better connection between our two victims than that disc.
Beckett : Ryan, can you check in with Jason's family,
Beckett : see if anyone recognizes Val?
Ryan : Yeah, on it.
Beckett : Espo, why don't you cross-reference their records
Beckett : and see if there are any similarities between the two of them?
UNK: If there's going to be pictures of us hanging up there,
Castle : we should really pick them out now.
Beckett : You know, Castle,
UNK: we could always use the photo that I took of you in bed the other night.
Castle : I don't know if that's how I wanna be remembered.
Beckett : Castle, I was joking.
Beckett : There will be no photos of us on that murder board.
