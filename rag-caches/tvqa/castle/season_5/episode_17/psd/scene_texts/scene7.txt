UNK: Hello?
Beckett : It doesn't look like there's anyone here.
Esposito : Doesn't look like anyone's been here this century.
Beckett : You're not buying into Castle's spirit craziness, are you?
UNK: No.
Esposito : You think I'm afraid of some old campfire story?
Esposito : - I'm a grown-ass man. - Need help?
Esposito : Just so you know, um, that was me being startled, not scared.
Esposito : - You run this place? - 41 years now.
Mitch : But you're in the wrong place. We're closed for the season.
Beckett : We just need to ask you a few questions.
Beckett : Do you recognize these people?
Beckett : Val Butler and Jason Bennett. They stayed here back in 2008.
Mitch : Long time ago, 2008. Seen a lot of faces come and go.
UNK: They would've been here in November.
Beckett : Do you remember anything unusual from that period?
Mitch : You wouldn't happen to know their room numbers?
Esposito : Yeah, uh, 213 and 313.
Mitch : The 13s.
Mitch : Those rooms, they're not normal rooms.
Mitch : They're reserved for people involved in trials at the courthouse.
Mitch : Down at 1135 Elm.
Esposito : 1135, that's the same number as the P.O. Box on that package.
UNK: That's got to be it, then.
Beckett : The murders have to be connected to a trial
Beckett : held at the courthouse in November of '08.
UNK: There was only one trial took place in November, '08.
Mitch : It was a terrible thing.
Esposito : You remember a trial from five years ago?
Mitch : No one here can forget.
Mitch : It was the trial of the century.
Mitch : That man murdered half a dozen people.
Beckett : Who are you talking about?
Mitch : Nigel Malloy.
Beckett : The serial killer?
Ryan : This is all about Nigel Malloy.
Castle : It makes perfect sense.
Castle : The clock tower from the DVD.
Castle : It's the same clock tower from the courthouse where he was tried.
Ryan : The rooftop and the alley were the scenes of his third and fourth murders.
