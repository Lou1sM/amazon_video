Esposito : Well, we have a witness that saw you in Val's apartment last night, Freddie.
Freddie : But I didn't kill her.
Freddie : Yes, I went over there, but only because she begged me to.
Beckett : Do you actually expect us to believe
Beckett : that she invited you over to her apartment
Beckett : after she filed a restraining order?
Freddie : It's true. She said she wanted to get back together.
Freddie : But when I got there,
Freddie : all she did was accuse me of sending her some package.
Esposito : What package?
Freddie : I have no idea.
Freddie : But when I told her I didn't send her anything,
Freddie : she started freaking out.
Beckett : How was she freaking out?
UNK: She kept saying, "It's real."
Esposito : What's real?
Freddie : I don't know. She wasn't making any sense.
Freddie : She kept asking me if I believed in the power of evil.
UNK: I didn't wanna get in trouble for breaking the R.O.,
UNK: so I got out of there, went to hang out with friends.
UNK: But when I left that apartment,
Freddie : Val was alive. I swear.
Esposito : Freddie's alibi checks out.
Esposito : Friends confirm that he met them at 11 : 00,
UNK: they hung out at a club till dawn.
Beckett : So he's not our guy.
