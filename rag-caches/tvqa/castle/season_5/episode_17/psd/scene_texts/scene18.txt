Beckett : NYPD. Hold it right there.
Mark : Why can't he just leave us alone? We suffered so much already.
Mark : The guilt nearly killed the three of us.
Castle : Why would you have guilt about getting a serial killer convicted?
Mark : Because that's not the whole story.
Mark : We all have blood on our hands.
Castle : Blood? What blood?
Castle : Mark, talk to me. I need to know. What blood is on your hands?
Mark : What does it matter?
Mark : He's come back for us. We're all gonna die.
Castle : It matters because if you did something wrong,
Castle : it could be the key to getting out of this alive.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : Get off of me! Let me go!
Beckett : You? Leopold's nurse.
Beckett : Leopold. It was you.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : No. No.
Beckett : You're the one that's killing for him.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : No. No. You don't understand.
Beckett : That's how he got to the witnesses. He was using you.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : You don't get it.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : I'm not here to kill Heller. I'm here to save him!
Beckett : What are you even talking about?
UNK: That's why Leopold sent me. I...
UNK: Step back! Step back!
Castle : All right.
UNK: He knew people would think that he was behind the murders.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : And then he wouldn't be able to get out of the asylum.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : I love him. I was just trying to protect him.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : We knew we had to stop the murders. It's not us, I swear.
Beckett : If it's not you, then who is it?
Freddie : I don't know.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : But I went to Nigel's grave, just to be sure.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : I dug it up.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : He was gone.
Beckett : No. Evil spirits don't kill. People do.
