Castle : It's here.
Castle : Do you think it'll matter that we still have a day left?
UNK: Or will it be like a "three birds with one stone" thing?
Beckett : Where are your circuit breakers?
Mark : Outside, by the tool shed.
Beckett : Someone's out there.
UNK: Seriously?
UNK: What's it like? Is it ghastly? Pale? Pissed?
Beckett : I can't get a good look at his face. Do you have a back door?
Mark : Yeah. Yeah. Through the kitchen.
Beckett : Okay, Castle, you keep an eye on Mark.
Beckett : I'm gonna head out back,
Beckett : double around, see if I can surprise him.
UNK: What? Wait, we're splitting up?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : NYPD. Hold it right there.
Mark : Why can't he just leave us alone? We suffered so much already.
Mark : The guilt nearly killed the three of us.
Castle : Why would you have guilt about getting a serial killer convicted?
Mark : Because that's not the whole story.
Mark : We all have blood on our hands.
Castle : Blood? What blood?
Castle : Mark, talk to me. I need to know. What blood is on your hands?
Mark : What does it matter?
Mark : He's come back for us. We're all gonna die.
Castle : It matters because if you did something wrong,
Castle : it could be the key to getting out of this alive.
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : Get off of me! Let me go!
Beckett : You? Leopold's nurse.
Beckett : Leopold. It was you.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : No. No.
Beckett : You're the one that's killing for him.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : No. No. You don't understand.
Beckett : That's how he got to the witnesses. He was using you.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : You don't get it.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : I'm not here to kill Heller. I'm here to save him!
Beckett : What are you even talking about?
UNK: That's why Leopold sent me. I...
UNK: Step back! Step back!
Castle : All right.
UNK: He knew people would think that he was behind the murders.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : And then he wouldn't be able to get out of the asylum.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : I love him. I was just trying to protect him.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : We knew we had to stop the murders. It's not us, I swear.
Beckett : If it's not you, then who is it?
Freddie : I don't know.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : But I went to Nigel's grave, just to be sure.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : I dug it up.
UNK: Nurse Lockheart : He was gone.
Beckett : No. Evil spirits don't kill. People do.
Mark : Before Nigel, the police arrested someone else.
Mark : David Collier. The guy had a history of mental illness.
Mark : Me, Val and Jason had to pick him out of a lineup.
Mark : None of us were sure, but the police, they...
Castle : They pressured you into saying it was Collier.
Castle : What happened to him?
Mark : He couldn't take it.
Mark : The accusations, what people were saying.
Mark : He smashed a light bulb in his cell,
UNK: and he used the wire to electrocute himself.
Castle : So his heart stopped.
Castle : When did he die? Mark, exactly when did he die?
Castle : At midnight. Third night he was in prison.
UNK: "You saw. Midnight, third day, you die."
Castle : This isn't about Nigel. It's about Collier.
Castle : Mark, you gotta think. Did he have any friends, any relatives?
Mark : Yeah, he had a daughter, Amanda.
Castle : Val's roommate's name is Amanda.
Castle : Someone's here.
Amanda : Your three days are up, Mark.
Amanda : The same three days of fear my father had.
Castle : Stop right there.
UNK: Ow!
Castle : Right in my eyes!
Mark : - The gun! - I can't see.
Mark : Where is she?
Amanda : This is for my father.
UNK: Ah!
UNK: Castle!
UNK: See?
Castle : Told you this holy water would come in handy.
Beckett : So, according to Amanda's psych records,
Beckett : she suffered a mental break about a year ago.
Castle : That must be when she started fixating on revenge,
Castle : planning to punish all those who wrongly ID'd her dad.
UNK: You know, she must've cozied up to Val to find out where Jason and Mark were.
