Pearlmutter : All I'll say, Mr. Castle, is that, for now, cause of death is unknown.
Castle : Unknown. Hear that?
Castle : Not good.
Castle : What are you doing?
Castle : Checking my bucket list.
UNK: Seeing how many things I can get done in two days.
Castle : Can either one of you introduce me to Bill Shatner?
UNK: You know, finding who sent this disc
Ryan : should make Castle feel a whole lot better.
Esposito : Yeah. But what if the worst happens and Castle's right?
Esposito : Do you think he put me in his will?
Ryan : Dude, uncool.
Esposito : What? I'm just wondering.
Esposito : I mean, Castle's death will be sad and all,
Esposito : but his Ferrari sure would lessen my grief.
Ryan : You do realize that even putting that out in the universe is bad karma?
UNK: Please. Castle's not gonna die.
Esposito : We're not dealing with an evil spirit.
