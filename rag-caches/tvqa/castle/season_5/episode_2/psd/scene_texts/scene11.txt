Miles : I'd be able to break the story like she promised.
Miles : But she fought me.
Miles : She fought me, she went and grabbed for the gun.
Miles : Why would she fight me? I mean, I didn't even know the gun was loaded.
Castle : Well, the station manager confirmed Miles was on thin ice.
UNK: The only way he could save his career was to break a splashy story.
Castle : So he made a deal with Mandy to help her in exchange for the exclusive.
Beckett : Right, and then when she betrayed him,
Beckett : he snuck out of the press party to confront her
Beckett : and then things just got bad from there.
UNK: I gotta say, pretty brave of Mandy to take up that cause.
Ryan : Not what you'd expect from what people said about her.
UNK: Funny how her co-workers thought they knew her so well.
Esposito : She had this whole secret life she was hiding from them.
Castle : Yeah. It's late. I'm gonna get out of here.
Beckett : Yeah, me, too.
Castle : Walk you out?
UNK: Uh... No, thanks. I'm good.
UNK: Good night, guys.
Ryan : - Good night. - Good night.
UNK: Well, good night.
UNK: - Good night, Castle. - Good night.
Esposito : Look, it's Reggie.
Chip : And finally, here is number one
Chip : on this week's top ten sports moments of the week.
UNK: This one sent in from a Reggie Blake fan.
Chip : This is what happens when you try to barge through to see the Blake.
