Kristina : You know, ever since I saw you on that red carpet,
Kristina : that face of yours, I have been waiting to do this.
UNK: Well, if you've been waiting that long, why not wait a few minutes more?
UNK: Makeup Lady 2 : Where are you going?
Castle : To the fridge. To put away these strawberries.
UNK: We wouldn't want the chocolate to melt.
UNK: I can think of a better use for that chocolate.
UNK: Okay! See, let's talk about this for a second.
Kristina : Oh. You want to talk?
UNK: Well, I just... What are we... What are we... What are we doing here?
Beckett : Hey, Castle, how's your date?
Esposito : What are you doing?
UNK: Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
UNK: Get back! Get back! Whoa!
UNK: Castle?
UNK: Sorry. Ooh.
Castle : Don't worry.
Kristina : I got it.
UNK: Ah! Okay, I'll help, I'll help.
Castle : Hi, you've reached Richard Castle. Lucky you.
Kristina : Now that that's out of the way, where were we?
Jonathan : Um... Um...
Kristina : - Oysters. - Ooh. Let's skip the oysters.
UNK: Really? 'Cause I...
Kristina : Why are you playing so hard to get?
UNK: - I'm really not. I just... - You are.
Ryan : You know, no man has ever said no to me.
Kristina : Well, there was one.
Castle : Really? That sounds like an interesting story.
Castle : Tell me about him. How did he get away?
Kristina : I assure you, it had nothing to do with me.
UNK: Oh.
UNK: Wow.
UNK: Castle?
Castle : I know who the killer is.
Castle : Look, I tried everything to get away.
Castle : I hid under the counter, I was hiding in the bathroom.
UNK: At one point I tried to pull a Cape Fear up under the piano.
UNK: Yet when I walked in, she was straddling you on the couch.
UNK: Right? She's like the Terminator of sexpots.
Beckett : What is that even supposed to mean? She just keeps on coming?
UNK: What? That's...
Castle : The only reason I went on the date in the first place
Castle : was because you made a big deal about being single in public.
Beckett : Castle, I have 12 missed phone calls from Chip the sportscaster
UNK: because he thinks that I'm single, but that doesn't mean that
UNK: I'm gonna let him mount me in a Speedo just to prove it.
Castle : You didn't tell me he called.
UNK: Really? You're gonna play the jealousy card now?
Castle : Okay, look, I'll make it up to you, all right? Whatever you want.
UNK: What I want is not to have this image of a bikini-clad woman
Beckett : stuffing her boobs in your face. So good luck with that.
Castle : Don't I even get credit for figuring out who the killer is?
UNK: No!
Rebecca : Later in the week, we'll be seeing a warming trend.
Beckett : Mr. Haxton, can we have a word?
Miles : Uh... I'm about to go live with a story.
Beckett : So are we.
Castle : I just had a very interesting conversation with Kristina Coterra.
Castle : She told me that you are the one man
Castle : who's rejected her advances in the past.
Beckett : Yep, the one man.
Miles : Well, I don't see how that's relevant.
