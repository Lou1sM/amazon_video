Chip : Yeah, I'm guessing those eager fans did not get an autograph.
Esposito : Yo, you took that punch for me.
Esposito : You didn't have to do that.
Ryan : Well, it's what partners do, right?
Esposito : Come on. Let's go get a beer.
Esposito : I'm buying.
UNK: Cool.
UNK: Uh. Anywhere but a sports bar.
Esposito : Definitely not a sports bar.
UNK: Reggie Blake : I'm sorry.
UNK: Reggie Blake : I'm sorry. I should not have gone on that date.
UNK: I should've said no.
Beckett : Then why didn't you?
Castle : I'm no good at this. Pretending to be single.
Beckett : Yeah, but Castle, neither am I.
Beckett : And the last thing I want to do is have to worry about you with other women.
UNK: Well, for the record, I wasn't gonna sleep with her.
Lanie : I know.
Beckett : Look, that's not even the point.
Beckett : The point is I don't even know how to do this.
Beckett : Do you remember when Miles said that
Beckett : it's inevitable that this will fall apart,
Beckett : that it's destined to implode?
Castle : Just a reminder, Miles is a lying killer.
Castle : But, okay, maybe people find out,
Castle : and maybe we won't get to work together,
Castle : and maybe we'll implode.
Castle : Or maybe we'll continue to be amazing.
Castle : The point is we don't have the answers.
Castle : We just have to live with the questions and find our way.
Beckett : Okay, can...
Beckett : Well, can we just start here, then?
Beckett : Can we say that we will talk about dating other people,
Beckett : but we won't actually date other people?
UNK: Yeah, I can... No, I can do that.
UNK: Okay, good. 'Cause I have a gun, and you don't really have a choice.
