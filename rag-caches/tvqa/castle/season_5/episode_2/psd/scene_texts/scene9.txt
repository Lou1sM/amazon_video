Castle : Well, her pride was hurt, so she did a little digging.
Esposito : Turns out you did have a secret relationship.
Castle : Just not with Mandy.
Castle : She discovered you have a boyfriend that no one here knows about.
UNK: Well, my personal life's none of your business.
Beckett : Normally, yes.
Beckett : But it became our business when we found out that you lied to us
Beckett : about why you were at Mandy's apartment,
Beckett : and about what you were fighting over.
Beckett : - Now, did you take this photo? - No.
UNK: Wow, that's funny, because a search of your apartment
Castle : turned up a camera with this and other photos on it.
Beckett : She was your partner.
UNK: She was helping you with the story. So why didn't you come forward?
Castle : Well, there's only one conceivable reason.
Castle : Because you killed her.
Miles : She was a colleague and a friend. Why would I kill her?
UNK: Because she uncovered the expose of a lifetime.
Castle : A story that big has to be vetted by legal.
UNK: That can take weeks, even months.
Beckett : But Mandy couldn't wait that long, not while kids were getting sick.
Beckett : So she decided to turn the findings over to the EPA.
Castle : At which point, you lose your big exclusive.
Castle : Now when was the last time you had a big exclusive?
Miles : This is crazy. You think I killed someone for a story?
Beckett : We know it was you, Miles.
Beckett : We found gunshot residue on the clothes in your hamper.
Beckett : On the ski mask.
Lanie : The shirt.
