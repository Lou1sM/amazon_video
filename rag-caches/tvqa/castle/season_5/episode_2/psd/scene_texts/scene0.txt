UNK: Detective Kate Beckett : Castle, what do you think of this one?
UNK: Richard Castle : Mmm... Sexy.
UNK: Sexy? What do you mean by sexy?
UNK: I mean... Well, I mean sexy. Yeah, sexy. What's wrong with sexy?
UNK: Oh, God, Castle, this is my first day back at work.
Beckett : I'm supposed to look normal.
Castle : No one is going to be able to tell that we're together by how you are dressed.
UNK: Oh, no? I only work with a room full of detectives.
Beckett : It's their job.
Beckett : What about this one?
Lanie : I don't know.
Beckett : You just want me to take my shirt off again, don't you?
UNK: Detective Kate Beckett : - What? - Stop it.
UNK: I told you that NYPD has a strict policy about co-workers dating.
Castle : Yes, but since I'm not getting paid, technically we're not co-workers.
UNK: Oh, really? And you think that Captain Gates is gonna see it that way?
Beckett : If anyone finds out, and she gets wind of it...
Castle : No one is going to find out. I haven't even told my mother or Alexis.
Beckett : Yeah, that's because they're in Europe celebrating her graduation.
UNK: Yes, true, but I haven't told them long distance.
Castle : Look, no one is going to find out.
UNK: But just to be safe, you might want to change out of those pants.
Beckett : There's a murder uptown.
UNK: And it looks like the pants stay on.
Beckett : Castle, remember, act normal.
Beckett : And when we're in public, you're single and I'm single.
Beckett : - Got it? - Got it.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Wow.
Castle : So that's a no to carpooling, then?
Castle : I'll take a cab.
UNK: Detective Javier Esposito : Yeah, yeah, that's...
Castle : Good morning, Detective Beckett.
Beckett : Castle, where's my coffee?
Castle : You already had one.
Beckett : You've been bringing me coffee for the past four years.
Beckett : I told you to act normal. This is gonna look suspicious!
