Beckett : she never said who,
Beckett : but someone was obsessed with her?
Paul : Well, no doubt she was talking about her boyfriend,
Paul : the young man who killed her.
Castle : Ah, but she took the meeting with her counselor before she met her boyfriend.
Beckett : But she had met you.
Beckett : You've had an odd career, Professor.
Beckett : You taught at four schools in six years.
UNK: So I made a few inquiries,
Beckett : and there were intimations of stalking, sexual harassment and even worse.
Paul : All of which were false!
Paul : And let me point out no action was ever taken against me.
Beckett : Justine had scheduled a meeting with the Dean
Beckett : on the day that she was killed to explain why she was leaving.
Castle : You couldn't let her take that meeting.
Castle : If she did,
Castle : your dirty history would be exposed, you'd be finished.
Beckett : So you killed her.
Castle : And being the predator that you are, you took a souvenir, her pendant.
Beckett : With all the suspicion on Kurt Wilson, no one was looking at you.
Beckett : Until Anne came along.
Paul : I don't know what you're talking about.
Beckett : Anne found that pendant. She knew it was you.
Beckett : And when she went into the woods, you followed her.
Paul : What woods? I wasn't in any woods!
UNK: We checked your phone records.
UNK: Your cell pinged the same tower as Anne's did
