UNK: around the time that she was attacked.
UNK: That places you at the crime scene.
UNK: We also found a club with Anne's blood on it and someone else's DNA.
UNK: And based on the look that you're giving me right now,
UNK: I'm pretty damn sure it's yours.
Beckett : So, Castle, are you disappointed that there's no Bigfoot after all?
Castle : Well, I'm not so sure there isn't.
Castle : I'm thinking maybe he's out there somewhere.
UNK: And if he is, I hope to see him one day.
Castle : Preferably from a safe distance.
Kurt : Thank you for finishing what Anne started.
Kurt : Because of you guys, Justine's killer will pay for what he did to her.
Kurt : And I'm a free man.
Castle : So, what's next for you?
Kurt : I'm going to continue Anne's work.
Castle : You're going to research Bigfoot? Why?
Kurt : Well, when she suggested I hide out in those woods,
UNK: she told me I'd have company out there.
Kurt : She was right.
Ryan : - Did you hear that? - Mmm-hmm.
UNK: I'll go get my outfit.
UNK: Ooh!
UNK: Hey!
Martha : You, um... You've still got a little on your...
UNK: I'm... I'm so sorry about that.
Alexis : Do you know how humiliating that was?
Castle : I swear, I had no idea it was you.
Castle : But, Alexis, why were you stealing food?
Alexis : Because I ran out of money.
Castle : How could you have possibly spent all your money? Unless...
Castle : Wait, no. Are you in some kind of trouble?
UNK: No. I didn't spend it, I gave it away. Invested it, really.
Castle : Invested in what?
Alexis : My friend Jonah at school has a crowd funding campaign
Alexis : to plant bamboo forests on the roofs of skyscrapers to help clean the air.
Castle : Why didn't you just come to me?
UNK: Because I didn't want the speech.
UNK: Well, I don't... What speech?
