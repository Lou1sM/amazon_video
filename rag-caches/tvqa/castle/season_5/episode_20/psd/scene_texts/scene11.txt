Beckett : Police! Turn around!
Beckett : Put your hands up!
Castle : Beckett, what are you doing? Are you crazy?
UNK: It can't understand you!
UNK: Now!
UNK: Whoa!
Castle : Shoot it! Shoot it! What are you waiting for?
UNK: Oh, God!
Castle : Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's talking.
Darrell : Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Darrell : Please don't shoot!
Castle : Don't shoot him.
Castle : Well, this is a huge disappointment.
Darrell : No, this is a big misunderstanding!
Beckett : Is it?
Beckett : Because those claws could have easily caused Anne's injuries.
Darrell : What? I'd never hurt Anne!
UNK: Do you actually expect us to believe that?
UNK: With you dressed up in this getup,
Beckett : right in the same area where she was attacked?
Darrell : Wait, she was attacked here? I thought she was attacked in the city.
UNK: No.
UNK: Okay, okay, okay. This looks bad.
Darrell : Let me just try and explain, okay.
Darrell : I knew that Anne was coming out here on her own,
UNK: and I admit that I followed her.
UNK: Why?
Darrell : Because I think she found Bigfoot.
Beckett : Or maybe she just found an idiot
