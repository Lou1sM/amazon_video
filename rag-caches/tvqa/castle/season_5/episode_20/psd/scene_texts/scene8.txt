Esposito : What's that?
Ryan : Nothing. What do you got?
Esposito : Grab your coat. We got a hit on that photo of Kurt Wilson.
Esposito : One of Anne's neighbors just saw him go into her apartment.
Ryan : Hey, Wilson. NYPD!
Esposito : Not much of a running back there, Wilson,
Esposito : but then, you're out of training.
Ryan : All right, let's go.
Ryan : We got him, and he's not talking.
Ryan : What do you want us to do?
Beckett : Okay, check his clothes for Anne's blood.
Ryan : How are you guys doing on the crime scene?
UNK: Uh...
Beckett : We ran into a little snag, but when we find it,
UNK: hopefully we'll find evidence that leads us straight to Kurt Wilson,
Beckett : and we won't need him to talk.
Castle : Ah, spork. They all laughed at you.
