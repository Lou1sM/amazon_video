Darrell : And it's working, too.
UNK: I mean, about an hour ago, I heard vocalizations and knocking on wood.
UNK: And those are classic Bigfoot mating calls!
UNK: I also found some half-eaten food and some scat.
Darrell : And not to mention, a tool that Bigfoot used to club his prey,
UNK: and there's blood on it.
Beckett : Wait a minute. You saw a bloody club?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : Show us where you found it.
Beckett : Do you recognize this?
Beckett : That's Anne Cardinal's blood. We're checking your clothes for it, too,
UNK: along with dirt that is going to place you in the woods.
UNK: Kurt Wilson : You're just like those other cops.
UNK: Kurt Wilson : You'd rather make your case than see the truth.
UNK: And what is the truth, Kurt?
Kurt : I was living out in those woods.
Kurt : But Anne wasn't trying to hunt me down.
Kurt : She came out there to help me, to bring me food and supplies.
Beckett : Why would Anne help the man that murdered her roommate?
Castle : A few months ago, I came out of hiding to find Anne.
UNK: I told her I was innocent,
Kurt : that I didn't kill Justine and I begged her to look into the case.
Kurt : And she agreed to because she believed me.
