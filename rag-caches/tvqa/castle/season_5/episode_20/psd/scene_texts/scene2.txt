UNK: and mysteriously killed where Bigfoot prints were found?
Beckett : No, not a coincidence, just a hoax.
Ryan : If it's such a hoax, then tell me why I found this?
UNK: I dug into her phone records.
Ryan : Turns out the last phone call she ever made was to Darrell Meeks.
Castle : The Darrell Meeks?
UNK: Beckett/esposito : Who's Darrell Meeks?
UNK: "Who's Darrell Meeks?"
UNK: Just a world-renowned cryptozoologist.
Castle : That's a scientist who searches for as-yet undiscovered creatures.
Beckett : Such as unicorns and centaurs.
UNK: Banshees and leprechauns.
UNK: Dr. Meeks also happens to be the foremost authority on Bigfoot.
Castle : And, lo and behold, she called him
UNK: on the very day she died.
Castle : Still think Bigfoot has nothing to do with this?
UNK: Perlmutter's got something for us. Why don't you guys head over there?
