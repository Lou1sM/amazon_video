UNK: Kurt Wilson : You're just like those other cops.
UNK: Kurt Wilson : You'd rather make your case than see the truth.
UNK: And what is the truth, Kurt?
Kurt : I was living out in those woods.
Kurt : But Anne wasn't trying to hunt me down.
Kurt : She came out there to help me, to bring me food and supplies.
Beckett : Why would Anne help the man that murdered her roommate?
Castle : A few months ago, I came out of hiding to find Anne.
UNK: I told her I was innocent,
Kurt : that I didn't kill Justine and I begged her to look into the case.
Kurt : And she agreed to because she believed me.
Beckett : Yeah, well, I'm a little more skeptical.
Castle : I can vouch for that.
Beckett : You have a history of violence, Kurt.
Beckett : And it's pretty clear that Justine dropped out
Beckett : and tried to break up with you, so you killed her.
Kurt : Justine did not drop out to get away from me.
Kurt : She and I were in love.
Kurt : When she told me she was quitting Hudson, I decided to go, too.
UNK: The two of us were planning on transferring to another school.
UNK: We'd even toured the campus at SUNY Binghamton the week before.
Kurt : I'm sure they have a record of that somewhere.
Castle : If you weren't the reason why Justine left Hudson, then what was?
Kurt : She never told me.
Kurt : She just said that things weren't working out.
Kurt : And I've spent a lot of time thinking about that,
Kurt : and the only thing that makes sense
