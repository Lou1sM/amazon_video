UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Richard Castle : Where'd it go?
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Where'd what go, darling?
Castle : My leftovers from Le Cirque.
Castle : They were right here, right where this hole in the fridge is.
UNK: I was gonna use that chateaubriand for my morning scramble.
Martha : Well, I certainly didn't eat them.
Martha : I wouldn't look this good if I was pigging out on leftovers.
Castle : Yes, well, this isn't the first time this has happened.
Castle : Food has been going missing for the past month.
Castle : It's not just leftovers, either. It was the peanut butter, artichokes,
Castle : a whole quart of mulligatawny soup. Gone.
Martha : Well, maybe you've been sleep-eating again.
UNK: Again? I've never sleep-ated. Sleep-ate. Eaten.
Castle : Have I?
UNK: Alexis Castle : Hey, I'm off to class.
Castle : Hey. How did you like that chateaubriand?
Castle : Wasn't that a wonderful white wine reduction?
Alexis : What chateaubriand?
Castle : All right, it's the housekeeper.
Castle : I knew it. She has been putting on weight.
Martha : Sorry, darling, she hasn't been here for three days.
Alexis : Maybe there are tiny Borrowers living under the floorboards
Alexis : who come out at night to steal your food.
UNK: It's not realistic.
UNK: They'd be too small to get the fridge door open.
Castle : No, but something is going on here, though.
UNK: And I'm gonna find out what.
