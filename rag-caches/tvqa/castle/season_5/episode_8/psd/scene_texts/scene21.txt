Castle : How do I know I can trust you?
Ryan : You don't.
Dolan : But you don't have to.
Dolan : All you have to do is sit here and wait for my phone to ring.
UNK: And then when I get what I want,
Dolan : we all walk away, alive.
Dolan : Whether you believe me, or not.
Leo : Here. Take the phone.
UNK: You get him?
Beckett : Sorry, Mickey. Maybe you should've sent more guys.
UNK: Maybe. I underestimated you, Detective.
Beckett : Yeah, well, I wouldn't make that same mistake again,
Beckett : especially if you hurt Castle.
UNK: So how about if we make a trade?
Dolan : I'll give you your writer back, you bring me the witness.
Gates : No. No.
Beckett : I'm not agreeing to anything until I know that Castle is okay.
Dolan : Shakespeare, you're up.
UNK: Kate?
UNK: Castle? Are you okay?
Castle : Yeah, I'm fine.
Castle : Listen, crazy as this sounds,
Castle : I actually think Mickey just wants to talk.
UNK: Everything's gonna be fine.
Beckett : I hope so.
Beckett : Maybe then we can reschedule something with our parents.
UNK: Maybe we could go and watch a baseball game, you know?
Beckett : Something that all four of us can enjoy.
Dolan : Good enough?
Beckett : Where should we meet?
Dolan : Under the Costello Bridge.
UNK: It's about three blocks from you. In about 15 minutes.
Leo : Well played.
Beckett : Let's go.
Leo : Not everything I told you was a lie. I really did have a shrink.
Leo : But then he diagnosed me as a sociopath with homicidal tendencies,
Leo : so I had to kill him.
Beckett : Listen, Leo, you don't want to do this, okay?
