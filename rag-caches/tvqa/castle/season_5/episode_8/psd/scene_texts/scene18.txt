Dolan : Now, is that building on the north side or south side of the street?
Dolan : - North. - That means south.
Dolan : We picked you up on the corner of 225th and Lex.
Dolan : So they're within a couple of blocks.
Dolan : Are they on 227th?
UNK: 226th?
UNK: 224th?
Dolan : Ah. 224th it is.
UNK: Go get 'em.
Leo : They're coming back. What should we do?
Gates : Thank you for coming, Agent Lucas.
UNK: Fbi Agent Lucas : - You made it sound urgent. - It is urgent.
Gates : One of my detectives and her colleague are missing.
Lucas : I'm not sure how I can help you.
Gates : You can tell me where to find Mickey Dolan.
Lucas : I can't discuss the Dolan case.
Gates : That is not acceptable.
Gates : My people are out there and I don't even know
Gates : if they're dead or alive.
Gates : Now where is he?
Lucas : We have no idea where he is.
UNK: The man just killed your informant. You realize that, don't you?
Lucas : Father McMurtry was not our informant.
Esposito : Dolan is your informant?
Lucas : Not yet. But we knew he and McMurtry were friends.
