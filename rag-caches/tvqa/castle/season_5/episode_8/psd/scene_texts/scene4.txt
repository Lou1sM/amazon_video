UNK: Sister Mary : The very same.
UNK: Sister Mary : He and Dolan grew up together.
UNK: Sister Mary : I tried to warn him, but he always believed
UNK: Sister Mary : he could set Mr. Dolan on a better path.
UNK: Sister Mary : He died believing it.
Ryan : If they were friends, why do you think that Dolan killed him?
UNK: Sister Mary : They had a terrible fight outside the church two days ago.
UNK: Sister Mary : I don't know what it was about,
UNK: Sister Mary : but the Father was very upset afterwards.
UNK: Sister Mary : Very upset.
Esposito : Well, a fight alone doesn't prove...
UNK: Sister Mary : I wasn't finished.
UNK: Of course. I'm sorry.
UNK: As I was about to say, last night at 6 : 00,
UNK: Sister Mary : the Father got a call and left in the middle of mass.
UNK: Sister Mary : He told me the call was about Dolan.
Castle : The priest and the mobster. It's a classic story.
Castle : Friends since childhood, one takes a higher calling
Castle : while the other follows a path to crime and murder.
Beckett : If this witness can ID Dolan,

Castle : And I still think we should've taken the subway.
Castle : It's kind of dangerous to park up here.
UNK: It's gonna be fine.
UNK: Yeah, what exactly did you mean earlier
