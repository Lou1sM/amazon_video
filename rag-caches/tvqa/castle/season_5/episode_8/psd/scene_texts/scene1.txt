UNK: Yeah. And I'm gonna be the good cop, you're gonna be the bad cop, so...
UNK: Ah.
UNK: Jerry Jenkins : I asked for a detective,
UNK: seeing as how my customers tend to get scared away by uniformed cops.
Beckett : Jerry, what do you know about the murder?
Jerry : Last night this guy wanders in. Leo.
Jerry : Says he heard shots on the corner of Fifth.
UNK: Then he'd seen some guy hustling out of the building there.
Jerry : Then today, I hear some priest got popped.
Castle : So this Leo was a witness. Any idea where Leo is now?
Jerry : He got pretty lit, so I loaded him in a cab
Jerry : and sent him home, up in the Bronx.
Beckett : - Do you remember the address? - Sure.
Jerry : 9245, 223rd Street.
UNK: - Right this way. - Oh, okay.
Ryan : Nun walks into a precinct. It's like the beginnings of a bad joke.
