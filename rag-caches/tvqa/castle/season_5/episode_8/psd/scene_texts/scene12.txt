UNK: Ah!
Beckett : What Leo said was crazy, right?
Castle : Yeah. Come on.
UNK: Like we're a couple of idiots who can't remember what we were fighting about.
UNK: So, what were we fighting about?
UNK: Sister Mary : I don't know.
UNK: Look, I don't know whether I just... I wanted the dinner to go well.
Castle : And when it didn't...
UNK: You said "different worlds."
UNK: What?
Beckett : You said that they're from different worlds,
Beckett : and that we should just expect it.
Beckett : And then I started thinking about us.
UNK: You're this world famous, bestselling author,
Beckett : and I'm just this cop.
UNK: And we're in this relationship which makes absolutely no sense on paper.
Beckett : And sometimes I just start wondering, are we just kidding ourselves?
Beckett : What if this bubble bursts?
Beckett : What are we then?
