Leo : It's okay to be worried.
UNK: He's gonna be fine.
Beckett : He's smart. And he's resourceful, so...
UNK: Larger-than-life. From another world.
Beckett : How did you...
Leo : Please, we're in a basement. Sound carries. I heard.
Beckett : That was a personal conversation.
Leo : About how different you two are, and that worries you, right?
UNK: I don't wanna have this discussion right now.
Leo : And those differences that are so charming now,
UNK: they may end up just pulling you apart.
Beckett : Who are you, Dr. Phil?
UNK: No.
Leo : Just a guy that may die tonight realizing that life's short.
Leo : Trust me, living your life for now
Leo : makes a lot more sense than worrying about the future.
