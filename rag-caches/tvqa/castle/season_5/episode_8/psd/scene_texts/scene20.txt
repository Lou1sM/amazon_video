Esposito : If he was in federal custody on the night of the murder, then...
Ryan : Then he didn't kill Father McMurtry.
Gates : So who did? Who had motive?
Ryan : The O'Reillys.
Ryan : It was Dolan's testimony that would send them all up the river.
Lucas : That's why they're all leaving town. That's why they killed McMurtry.
Lucas : To draw him out.
Gates : So Dolan is hunting whoever killed the priest,
Gates : and the O'Reillys are hunting Dolan.
Lucas : And both sides will take out anyone who gets in their way.
Beckett : Get the gun! Get the gun!
Beckett : What are you doing, Leo?
Leo : My job.
Leo : Who are you?
Leo : Let's just say I'm an independent contractor
Leo : trying to get close to his mark.
Beckett : So you're not a witness?
Beckett : You're just pretending.
Beckett : You killed McMurtry because you were trying to get to Dolan,
Beckett : and you knew that if you played the witness,
Beckett : he would come to you.
Leo : Quick study.
Beckett : Why the charades?
Beckett : Why didn't you just kill Castle and me?
Leo : Well, it's a little hard to play the innocent witness
Leo : with two bodies lying around,
Leo : so I had to go along with the whole "on the run" thing.
Leo : But now time has run out and I have to make my next move.
Leo : You, where's your phone?
UNK: Look, you don't wanna do this.
Castle : Killing a cop? You know what kind of trouble that brings.
Dolan : Kill her? Trust me, I'm not planning to kill her.
Castle : Well, McMurtry trusted you and look what happened to him.
Dolan : You think I killed Joey?
Dolan : Joey was my best friend.
Dolan : Long after our lives went off in separate directions,
Dolan : he never gave up on me.
Dolan : I'd never hurt him.
Dolan : I can't say the same for whoever iced him.
Dolan : That's why I need to talk to the witness
Dolan : before you put him in protective custody,
Dolan : so I can find out who the hell the son of a bitch was
Dolan : that took Joey out.
