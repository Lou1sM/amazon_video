UNK: What?
Beckett : The password's the cat's name.
Castle : - Exactly! - Great.
Leo : - So what's the cat's name? - He doesn't know.
UNK: I don't know. But as soon as we figure it out, we're golden.
Beckett : Castle, we're looking for some real solutions.
Castle : And I'm offering them.
Beckett : How? By focusing on a phone that's never gonna...
Castle : You were saying?
Castle : And I don't need the passcode to answer.
Castle : Hello, you godsend, thank God you called.
Woman : Hey. Whoever you are, you better bring my phone back.
Castle : Wait, this is your phone?
Woman : Yeah. I need that phone. It's got all my pictures of Lola on it.
Woman : All my apps, all my music...
Beckett : Hey, hey, hey. Tell her to call 911 and tell her where we are.
Castle : Okay, listen, listen. We're in Leimart Park.
Woman : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know exactly where you are.
Woman : I used GPS to track you.
UNK: You did? Okay, good. Good.
Castle : Then call 911. We are in trouble.
UNK: Oh, yeah. Damn right you are. Especially if I get my hands on you.
Leo : Tell her about the killer.
Beckett : - Shh. - What?
UNK: "Kill her"? Are you threatening me?
UNK: No, no. Not "kill her." Killer. Killer.
Castle : We're being chased. We need you to call 91...
Woman : Don't threaten me!
UNK: Father Mcmurtry : Hello? Hello?
Leo : Why'd you let her hang up? We were so close.
Castle : Yes, I let her hang up.
Castle : Look, all is not lost.
Castle : She told me the passcode.
Castle : The cat's name is Lola.
Castle : Bingo! Who's the genius now?
Castle : Now, all I need to do is... No! No, no, no!
Leo : What? What, what, what?
Castle : She remotely disabled the phone.
UNK: Oh!
UNK: Ugh.
Beckett : You guys! There's a cab outside.
Beckett : It's going slow enough, I think we can catch it.
UNK: Ah.
Beckett : Hey! Hey!
UNK: Ow!
Leo : My ankle, my ankle!
Castle : Go, go! Stop the cab! Stop the cab! I got Leo. I got Leo.
UNK: Hey!
Castle : Seriously, man? You are killing me.
UNK: Hey!
Cabbie : Hey! Hey, hey! Off duty!
Beckett : No. Please. This is an emergency. I'm a police officer.
Cabbie : I'm the Sultan of Siam. These are my loyal subjects.
Beckett : No, no, you don't understand. This isn't a joke. We need your help.
Cabbie : You got trouble written all over you.
UNK: I will give you $ 1,000 to get us into the city.
Martha : - Really? - Yeah.
Cabbie : Let's see the money.
UNK: Well, I don't have it on me, but I do have this lovely watch.
UNK: Richard Castle : - No! - No, no, no, no, no.
Castle : It tells time underwater! It tells time in three different time zones!
Castle : And right now it's telling me it's time to go.
Beckett : - Move. Come on! Move! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Beckett : Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Leo : Come on!
Leo : Come on.
UNK: Go!
UNK: Ah! Ah! Ah!
UNK: Okay, here, come on.
UNK: - Ah! Ah! - Shh!
Leo : I'm sorry. I hurt my ankle pretty badly. I can't stand on it.
UNK: Shh.
UNK: It's not gonna take those guys very long to figure out where we went.
UNK: Yeah, but if he can't stand, it's gonna be hard to move.
Castle : Yes. Even harder to run.
UNK: They gotta be here somewhere.
UNK: Colin Clark. Quite a list of priors.
