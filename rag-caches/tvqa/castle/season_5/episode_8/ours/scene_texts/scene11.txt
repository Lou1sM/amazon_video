Leo : It's a shame you won't be able to work 'em out.
UNK: But like I said, life's too short.
Leo : There they are.
UNK: No! Don't!
UNK: No!
Leo : What the...
Dolan : Looks like you missed.
Dolan : Drop the act.
Dolan : We both know you emptied your clip into that car.
UNK: How'd you get onto me?
Dolan : I wish I could say I figured it out,
Dolan : but Shakespeare over here made the call.
Castle : Once you made that comment about my mom enjoying baseball,
UNK: I knew we were about six months away from joking about that.
Castle : Something had to be up.
Dolan : All I wanted to do was ask you a question about who killed my friend.
UNK: Mickey!
UNK: Well, I guess I don't have to ask that anymore.
Castle : Mickey, don't.
Dolan : He killed Joey in cold blood.
Woman : Yeah, I know. But what would Joey want?
Castle : You said he never gave up on you.
Castle : If you pull that trigger,
Castle : you are giving up on him.
Leo : This doesn't end with me.
Ryan : The O'Reillys, they'll just send somebody else.
Leo : You're a dead man.

Dolan : Take his gun.
UNK: Get your hands up. Get them up!
Leo : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
UNK: Come here.
Beckett : I thought I lost you.
Castle : No, no, never, never.
UNK: Here, let's get you out of these.
Castle : These are for you.
Castle : Now let's get the hell out of here.
Beckett : Sounds good to me.
Beckett : Excuse me. Excuse me. Can you help us get a ride?
UNK: We're gonna be tied up here for a bit. Why don't you guys just take a cab?
UNK: Really?
Beckett : - Let's go. - Yeah.
