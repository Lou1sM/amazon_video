Ryan : Not that I'd ever doubt a nun.
UNK: Victoria Gates : What about the phone call McMurtry got?
UNK: Victoria Gates : You trace it to Dolan?
UNK: Yeah. It was made from a pay phone.
Ryan : Guy spent 20 years rising through the ranks of the Irish Mob.
Ryan : Not surprising he'd cover his tracks.
Gates : Dolan and his kill squad are as smart as they are ruthless.
Gates : And as the enforcer for the O'Reilly family,
Gates : he's the prime suspect in dozens of hits.
Gates : Only we've never been able to make a case against him.
Esposito : Yo. Unis came back from Dolan's apartment.
Esposito : Looks like he hasn't been there in a while.
UNK: Does the Organized Crime Task Force know where he is?
Esposito : They say that he's been off their radar the past few days.
Esposito : Word is, there's something big going on.
Esposito : Maybe a turf war or a power struggle within the O'Reilly family.
Esposito : There may be bloodshed, so they figure that Dolan went underground.
Ryan : Guy took out a priest. We can't just let him disappear.
Gates : No, no. Even if we knew where he was, we don't have enough to charge him.
Gates : Shoot Beckett Dolan's mug shot. See if their witness can ID him.
UNK: Yeah. We're on it.
