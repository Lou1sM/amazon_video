Beckett : I'm a cop.
UNK: Thug 1 : They must be after Leo. We should call the boss.
Castle : The boss, as in Mickey Dolan?
Beckett : We know about McMurtry. Just walk away while you got a chance.
UNK: Thug 1 : You're not getting that witness.
Leo : Hey, what's all the noise out here?
UNK: Sorry! Sorry, I'm sorry.
UNK: - Wait, who are you? - NYPD.
UNK: Thug 1 : Open up! Open up now!
Beckett : - These locks won't hold! - Open up!
Beckett : Castle, bring that over, we gotta block the door.
Castle : - A little help? - Yeah.
Beckett : - It's dead. - They must've cut the line.
UNK: What is this? What the hell is going on?
Castle : We're here to save you.
UNK: Thug 1 : Just give us the guy and we won't hurt you!
UNK: - Somehow, I don't believe him. - What guy?
Leo : - Am I the guy? - Yeah. You're the guy.
Martha : - Oh! - Open up!
Leo : What do they want with me?
UNK: That guy you saw holding a gun?
UNK: Well, he killed somebody. And you're the witness.
UNK: A witness they wanna get rid of.
Leo : Okay, this is not good. Not good! How do they even know what I saw?
Beckett : Same way we do. You ran your mouth off at a bar.
UNK: But it was dark! I mean, I didn't even really see that much!
Castle : As far as they're concerned, you saw enough.
UNK: - Oh, God. We gotta get out of here! - Do you think?
UNK: Come on, guys.
UNK: It's not gonna take Dolan's boys long to get through that door.
Leo : I'm sorry, Dolan? As in Mickey Dolan, the mobster?
UNK: Oh, God! We're gonna end up floating in the river with cement shoes on!
UNK: Yes, but, technically, if you have cement shoes,
UNK: you're not gonna be floating.
Castle : - What? - What?
Castle : - You're right. That's not helping. - Let's go.
Beckett : Let's go.
Castle : Dude, where's your car?
Beckett : - Where's my car? - Where's your car?
Beckett : It was right here!
Leo : You parked here? Are you kidding me? Don't you see this neighborhood?
UNK: Don't!
Beckett : Go! Go, go, go, go!
UNK: Thug 1 : Get the car.
Ryan : So the nun was right.
Ryan : Father McMurtry did fight with Mickey Dolan.
Ryan : Surveillance cam footage outside the church backs Sister Mary's story.
