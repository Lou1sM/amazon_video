Esposito : Did it ever get that bad with either of your exes?
Castle : No. No, both my divorces were amicable.
Beckett : Yeah, a little too amicable.
Castle : So, something was going on with Michelle Twohey.
Castle : On the morning of her death,
Castle : she arrived to court late, and she had been crying.
Castle : So where was she coming from?
Beckett : Well, according to her financials,
Beckett : she paid for breakfast at a cafe right before court.
Beckett : So maybe someone there will let us know what was so upsetting.
UNK: Hmm.
Esposito : Bro, what was that?
Castle : What was what?
Ryan : Your girlfriend just uttered a sarcastic remark about your ex-wife,
UNK: and all you're gonna say is, "What was what?"
Castle : Oh, that was nothing.
Esposito : - Spit it out. - Tell us.
Castle : Uh, okay, as you know,
Castle : Beckett is staying at the loft while her place is getting fumigated,
Castle : Alexis is home sick as well, and then Meredith showed up
Castle : and she said she wanted to stay in the loft...
Esposito : And you said no.
Esposito : Tell me you said no.
Beckett : - Wow. - Really?
Esposito : Letting an ex stay with you when you're with someone else,
Esposito : that's like throwing gasoline on fireworks.
