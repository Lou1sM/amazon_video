Castle : Because Billy's dead wife Leann is alive.
Beckett : Again, thank you, Mrs. Garrison,
Beckett : for coming down here at such a late hour.
UNK: Jane Garrison : Didn't my husband answer all the other detectives' questions?
Castle : Oh, he did. But there was just one that only you can answer.
Castle : Who's this woman?
Beckett : Here. Let me get that for you.
Beckett : Thank you.
Jane : Sorry. I don't recognize her.
Castle : Sure about that?
UNK: Because, you know,
Beckett : you can change your name, you can change your looks,
Beckett : but there is one thing that you cannot change.
Beckett : Your fingerprints.
Beckett : We know who you are.
Castle : Hello, Leann. Welcome back from the dead.
Jane : I think you must have the wrong person.
Beckett : You can drop the charade, Leann.
Beckett : We spoke with your current husband.
UNK: He said that you drove into the city the night that Michelle was killed.
Beckett : And he also identified the murder weapon
UNK: as a mahogany handled ice pick missing from your kitchen.
Castle : You know, it's funny.
Castle : For a minute there, we thought Walter was helping Billy.
Castle : But actually, he was helping you.
Beckett : The only thing that we couldn't figure out was why.
Beckett : Why did you go through all of this?
Jane : Because everybody loved Billy.
Jane : You try being married to him.
Jane : He was a hero in public, and a monster at home.
Jane : When I finally got the courage to divorce him,
Jane : you know how the media portrayed me?
UNK: As just another gold-digging trophy wife looking for her half.
Jane : He destroyed my reputation.
UNK: He was gonna destroy me.
UNK: The only way I could get my life back was to die.
