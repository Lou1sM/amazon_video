Beckett : So head down to her office
Beckett : and see what cases she was working on.
Beckett : And you know what? Since Michelle only represented women,
Beckett : see if any of the men she went up against threatened her.
Beckett : Yeah, men are known to do stupid things
Beckett : when it comes to their ex-wives.
Beckett : Okay, thank you.
Castle : Hey. I'll get that for you.
Beckett : That's okay. I got it.
Castle : So, just to let you know,
Castle : I'm real sorry about that whole Meredith thing,
Castle : but I am going to take care of it.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : Yeah, okay, we'll be right there.
Beckett : Lanie's got something for us.
Castle : You go deal with that.
UNK: I'm gonna go deal with the other thing.
Castle : Take care of it.
UNK: No, you've gotta take care of it.
Lanie : This is Meredith we're talking about,
UNK: the deep-fried Twinkie that Castle has ex sex with
UNK: whenever she rolls into town.
Beckett : Lanie! Look, I trust him.
UNK: He's not gonna have sex with her.
