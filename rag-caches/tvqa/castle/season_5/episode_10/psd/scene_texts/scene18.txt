UNK: Well, we could dig into Walter's life, maybe find some proof.
Beckett : And some motive, too, if we're lucky.
Castle : Okay, so it's not just me. Walter has no real motive, does he?
Beckett : No. I mean why would Walter help Billy kill his wife?
Beckett : Yeah, sure, they're friends, but what was in it for Walter?
Castle : It's not like they agreed to kill each other's wives
Castle : like Strangers on a Train.
Castle : Though what we saw of Walter's relationship,
Castle : I'm sure he thought about it.
Esposito : Hey, guys. I found something in Walter's phone records,
Esposito : and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.
Esposito : On the morning of Michelle's murder,
UNK: Walter made a 20-minute phone call to the Garrison residence.
Beckett : Garrison? The accountant that Michelle was so desperate to meet?
Beckett : Why would Walter call him?
Castle : Who's this?
Esposito : The woman of my dreams.
Esposito : She's married to that accountant.
Castle : Guys, look at Billy's dead wife.
Castle : And now look at the accountant's wife.
Castle : Different hair, different nose, different chin, but...
Beckett : They're the same woman.
Castle : That's why they never found a body.
Castle : Because Billy's dead wife Leann is alive.
Beckett : Again, thank you, Mrs. Garrison,
Beckett : for coming down here at such a late hour.
UNK: Jane Garrison : Didn't my husband answer all the other detectives' questions?
Castle : Oh, he did. But there was just one that only you can answer.
