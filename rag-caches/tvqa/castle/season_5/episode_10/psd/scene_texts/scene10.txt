Beckett : Comparing notes.
Castle : What notes?
Castle : Seriously, though, what notes?
Beckett : Hey, Espo, what do you got on Noah?
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: I just got off with the vice president from that pharmaceutical company.
Esposito : Guess where he went to college? University of New York.
Castle : Sorry about that.
Esposito : Not only was he giving Noah access to that company car,
Esposito : but he's also been letting him stay with him for the past month.
Beckett : Okay, pick him up.
UNK: Boom.
Esposito : There he is.
Esposito : Hey! Noah Kesswood.
Esposito : NYPD. Come here. Hey!
UNK: Hey!
Ryan : That hurt as much as it looked?
UNK: Good.
Esposito : And now you're under arrest.
Beckett : Look at him.
Beckett : Nothing like the devastated boyfriend that I met yesterday.
UNK: Noah.
Esposito : You're good, man.
UNK: But you're not that good.
UNK: All right, let's not waste any time.
Beckett : We know that Billy hired you to spy on Michelle
Beckett : to see if she had any proof that he killed his wife.
Esposito : And when you discovered she did,
Esposito : on Billy's orders, you put an ice pick through her neck.
UNK: Noah Kesswood : I didn't kill Michelle.
Beckett : - I don't believe you. - You don't have to.
Noah : See, when Michelle was being shish-kabobed,
Noah : I was all the way up at University of New York
Noah : watching my alma mater play West Virginia.
Noah : We won, by the way. Go Broncos.
Beckett : If you didn't kill her, why'd you work so hard to disappear?
Noah : Detective, what do you say you buy me a soda, hmm?
Esposito : - Excuse me? - Not you.
UNK: You.
Noah : All right, look, I deal in intelligence.
Noah : Not murder. Never murder.
Noah : You want the truth?
Noah : Okay, here it is, free of charge.
