Jane : Because everybody loved Billy.
Jane : You try being married to him.
Jane : He was a hero in public, and a monster at home.
Jane : When I finally got the courage to divorce him,
Jane : you know how the media portrayed me?

Jane : He destroyed my reputation.
UNK: He was gonna destroy me.
UNK: The only way I could get my life back was to die.
UNK: - But you needed help. - And Walter needed the money.
Jane : At least, he did at the time.

Jane : I convinced Billy to take the trip,
Jane : and then when the scotch put him to sleep...
Beckett : You escaped onto Walter's boat, turning your husband into a wife killer.
