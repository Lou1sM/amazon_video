Jane : She sided with Billy.
Jane : I mean, she knew what he was like!
Jane : She knew what he did to me! Why couldn't she just leave it alone?
Beckett : Stand up.
Beckett : Let's go, come on. Stand up.
Beckett : Turn around. Hands behind your back.
Beckett : Leann Piper, you are under arrest
Beckett : for the murder of Michelle Twohey.
Castle : I mean, I know your apartment is habitable again, I just...
Castle : Do you have to leave?
Beckett : Do you want me here because you actually want me here?
Beckett : Or do you need protection from the redheads?
Castle : - A little of both. - Okay, I'll tell you what.
Beckett : If it gets to be too much, you can come and stay at my place.
Beckett : Thank you.
Meredith : Are you sure it's okay that I'm going to Paris without you?

Alexis : I just feel so guilty that

UNK: Mmm.

Beckett : You know, Meredith, it's so funny,
Beckett : when you first came and insisted on staying here,
UNK: I was afraid that you might've had a secret agenda.
Meredith : Actually, I did.
Meredith : When Alexis told me about you two, and how this one was serious,
Meredith : I knew I had to check it out for myself.
Meredith : And I'm so glad I did.
Meredith : - You two are great together. - Thank you.
