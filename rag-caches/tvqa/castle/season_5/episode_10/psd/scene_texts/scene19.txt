Castle : Who's this woman?
Beckett : Here. Let me get that for you.
Beckett : Thank you.
Jane : Sorry. I don't recognize her.
Castle : Sure about that?
UNK: Because, you know,
Beckett : you can change your name, you can change your looks,
Beckett : but there is one thing that you cannot change.
Beckett : Your fingerprints.
Beckett : We know who you are.
Castle : Hello, Leann. Welcome back from the dead.
Jane : I think you must have the wrong person.
Beckett : You can drop the charade, Leann.
Beckett : We spoke with your current husband.
UNK: He said that you drove into the city the night that Michelle was killed.
Beckett : And he also identified the murder weapon
UNK: as a mahogany handled ice pick missing from your kitchen.
Castle : You know, it's funny.
Castle : For a minute there, we thought Walter was helping Billy.
Castle : But actually, he was helping you.
Beckett : The only thing that we couldn't figure out was why.
Beckett : Why did you go through all of this?
