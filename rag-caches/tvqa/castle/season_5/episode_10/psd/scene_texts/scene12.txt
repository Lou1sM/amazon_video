Noah : She was gathering the final puzzle pieces
Noah : at the New York office of the DEA.
Beckett : The Drug Enforcement Agency? Why?
Noah : You'd have to ask them, Detective.
Beckett : Okay, well, I'm still gonna have to hold you, you know.
Noah : For up to 24 hours.
Noah : Then you'll never see me again.
Ryan : All right. Thanks, Bill.
Ryan : Well, Noah's alibi is solid. He's definitely not the killer.
Castle : But do we believe his story about the DEA?
Castle : I mean, what does any of this have to do with drugs?
Beckett : Well, there's only one way to find out.
Beckett : Ryan, see if you can uncover what Michelle was doing at the DEA.
Ryan : I'll try, but it's late. Probably won't hear anything till morning.
Beckett : Well, I guess we should call it a night.
Beckett : Okay, Castle, see you later.
Castle : Later? We can go back to my place together.
Beckett : Um, I have a dinner date with your ex-wife, remember?
Castle : Yeah, I remember. I was just hoping you'd forget.
Beckett : Okay, don't wait up.
Martha : Oh, darling, please just relax.
Castle : I can't relax, Mother.
UNK: My worlds are colliding. Okay? I'm not...
Castle : I can't relax.
Martha : Well, have a glass of wine. Works for me.
UNK: I bet they're out there right now just telling secrets about me. Boom!
Castle : What do I do?
Castle : - Should I call them? I should call them. - No. No, no.
Martha : What you shouldn't have done was let Meredith
Martha : stay here in the first place.
UNK: This isn't a flophouse, darling.
UNK: You gotta stop letting freeloaders just live here.
Castle : Please tell me you see the irony.
UNK: Oh, my God. Meredith, Castle did that?
UNK: I can't believe that you married him.
Castle : What can't you believe?
UNK: What? No. What... Don't...
Castle : Come on. Beckett, there's two sides to that story.
UNK: That... What did you... What story... What did you tell her?
Meredith : The truth, Richard.
Beckett : Castle, you're not the man that I thought I knew.
UNK: I'm the man you thought you knew. I'm the man you know.
UNK: I thought you... I'm that...
UNK: You... I know you. I'm him.
Castle : This is so not cool.
Beckett : You're right, he does lean to the left.
Meredith : Told you. Only when he's stressed.
UNK: I've never even noticed that before.
UNK: What did... What... What leans?
Beckett : Thank you, Meredith. That was so fun.
Meredith : Thanks for coming.
Beckett : You have a great night. Good night, Martha.
UNK: Good night, darling.
Castle : Okay, what did she say about me?
UNK: Oh, come on, I get it. I get it.
Castle : I mishandled this whole thing and I am sorry.
Castle : Believe me, I am sorry.
