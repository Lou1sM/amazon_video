UNK: Man, I just wanna wring this little bastard's neck right now.
UNK: I'm gonna call that a no.
UNK: So, we got a BOLO out on Shane and his car.
Esposito : Freakin' kids, man. I don't know how you do it, bro.
Castle : Ooh, no, no. I lucked out with Alexis.
Castle : At a certain point, you realize
Castle : you're just dealing with someone who hasn't been around as long as we have.
Castle : They have to find their way.
Esposito : The problem is he's already found his way.
Esposito : He just doesn't see where it's gonna put him.
Ryan : Hey. No luck on the BOLO, but I talked to Garcia in Robbery.
Ryan : We got a tip on Shane's location. You wanna roll?
Esposito : You know what? Let me get this one.
Bartender : Hey, sugar. What's your poison?
UNK: Hey, guys, how're you doing?
Bartender : Hello? What are you drinking?
Bodyguard : Mr. Winters is not taking any meetings today.
Esposito : Can I just get a bag of ice, please?
Bartender : What the hell do you want with a bag of ice?
Esposito : It's for him.
UNK: Excuse me. Thank you.
UNK: Shane Winters : You must be Detective Esposito.
UNK: Joey told me you two been hangin' out.
UNK: Shane Winters : Said sooner or later you'd find your way down here.
Esposito : So he warned you.
Winters : He's a good kid. Dependable.
UNK: Put 'em on.
Esposito : Or better yet, resist arrest. Please.
UNK: Some other time maybe, huh?
Ryan : Do you know a woman named Holly Rhodes, Shane?
Winters : Name sounds familiar.
Esposito : It should. You ran with her back in the day.
Winters : Oh, she ran. But not with me.
UNK: Then why did you bail her out when she was a teenager?
Winters : I got a soft spot for kids, man.
Carson : Yeah, yeah. You're just like a regular Mr. Rogers.
Ryan : When was the last time you saw her, Shane?
UNK: Ah, last time I saw Holly...
Winters : Don't recall.
Esposito : Well, let me help you out with that.
Esposito : It's three nights ago when you killed her.
Winters : You're wrong about that.
Ryan : Mmm. I don't think so.
Ryan : See, when this whole DJ-ing gig of Holly's took off,
Ryan : wealthy clients, penthouses,
Ryan : you saw a golden, diamond-encrusted opportunity.
Esposito : And that's when you pressured Holly
Esposito : into bringing in Joey Malone as an assistant.
