Esposito : - Tyrese... - Tyrese Wilton.
UNK: Yeah, him.
Joey : It was weird.
Joey : I was supposed to boost his cell phone.
Esposito : Why his cell phone?
Joey : I don't know. But I took it.
Esposito : Yeah? And then what?
Joey : Somehow Holly found out and she flipped.
Joey : She got in my face and told me to give the phone back.
Joey : And I got scared, because I knew she carried heat,
Joey : but I had already handed the phone off to Shane, so I got out of there.
UNK: And that was the last time I saw her.
Joey : I didn't know she would end up dead.
Joey : I didn't know Shane would kill her.
Beckett : So no doubt a guy like Shane would kill her,
