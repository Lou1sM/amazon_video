Carson : 'Cause I brought my lighting guy with me.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Hey, guys. So Kaiya confirms that she was "hanging out" with MC Thug
UNK: in one of the bedrooms till 12 : 30.
Ryan : And he did file a police report about the missing bracelet.
Ryan : So I requested a list of all the parties that Holly worked in the past year.
Ryan : Of the more than 50 events,
Ryan : turns out that thefts were reported in seven of them.
UNK: MO is the same every time. Mostly high-end jewelry.
Ryan : In total, almost half a million bucks,
UNK: all taken from parties at upscale residences.
Ryan : And I also confirmed with Holly's booking agent
Ryan : that she always worked with an assistant, Paul Travers.
UNK: Okay, so the two of them were a crew,
Beckett : using her DJ skills to access high-end homes
Beckett : and then cleaning them out along the way.
Esposito : She does have a history of theft.
Esposito : So maybe she went back to her old ways.
Castle : But if the assistant worked the party with her,
UNK: then where is he and why hasn't he come forward?
Beckett : There's only one reason. He was involved.
UNK: Paul Travers : Involved in what?
UNK: Paul Travers : My friend is dead and now you're saying,
UNK: what, like, we're like Bonnie and Clyde?
Beckett : Paul, thefts were reported at seven of the parties
