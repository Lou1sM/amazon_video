UNK: You keep showin' up here like this,
UNK: my boys are gonna think you're sweet on me.
Esposito : Not anymore, they won't.
Esposito : You are walking on grand larceny and accessory after the fact.
Esposito : Wow. Now that kind of luck does not last long.
UNK: I guess I gotta go play the Powerball then tonight.
Esposito : This is my gun.
Esposito : And this one will be yours.
Esposito : You ever go near Joey, or any other kid ever again,
UNK: the story's gonna go like this.
Esposito : You pulled that piece on me.
UNK: Now, I had to defend myself.
Esposito : So, I killed you.
Esposito : You understand me?
Esposito : Or should we play out that story right here, right now?
UNK: Ah.
Winters : I hear you.
UNK: Good.
