Beckett : It's no secret that Josie Lang's eclipsed you.
Regina : Oh, please. She's been around for two seconds.
Regina : Give it a year, you won't even remember her name.
Castle : It doesn't matter.
UNK: Both of your albums come out next week and she's going to crush you.
Beckett : Unless someone mysteriously leaks Josie's new album online.
Castle : Your plan was simple.
Castle : Hire Shane to steal the phone. That way you can get into the studio.
Beckett : The one thing that you didn't plan on was Holly.
Beckett : She showed up and caught you just as you were leaving the studio.
Castle : And you couldn't risk her exposing you.
Castle : You fought, she pulled out her gun to protect herself,
Castle : but you managed to use it on her instead.
Beckett : So you called Shane and you got him to get rid of the body.
Regina : Are you kidding me? That's all speculation.
Beckett : The one thing that's not speculation is that you hired DJ Beat.
UNK: - How'd you find out about her? - Word of mouth.
Beckett : More like your bodyguard grew up with Shane Winters.
UNK: Shane had you hire DJ Beat so that Joey could get in and steal that phone.
Castle : You know what else isn't speculation? The warrant she served on your ISP.
Beckett : That warrant revealed the email account
Beckett : that you created to communicate with the hacker
Beckett : that was going to leak Josie's new album online.
Beckett : Is that enough fact for you?
Regina : My record sales may be down,
Regina : but I can still afford a damn good lawyer.
