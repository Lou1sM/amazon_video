Joey : So talk.
Beckett : We're looking into the murder of Holly Rhodes.
Joey : Heard about that. Real sad.
Beckett : I understand that two nights ago you worked for her.
Beckett : Did you see her having problems with anyone?
UNK: No.
Beckett : - You know why she left the party early? - Nope.
Beckett : - Do you know where she went? - No clue.
Beckett : Okay, let me ask you this.
Beckett : Why do you think Holly hired a 14-year-old kid with a record
Beckett : to be her tech assistant?
Joey : 'Cause I'm the best.
Beckett : The best at what? Stealing?
Beckett : Every time you've worked for Holly, high-end jewelry has gone missing.
Beckett : Every single time.
Joey : I don't know nothing about that.
Beckett : Did Holly know about the stealing or did she find out that night?
Beckett : Is that why you killed her?
Joey : What? Kill her? No. No. I didn't do that.
Beckett : We have witnesses that saw you leave the party right after she did.
Beckett : And you never came back for the equipment.
Beckett : So, where were you between 11 : 00 and midnight?
Joey : I was at TV King.
UNK: You left the party and the equipment
Beckett : to go to TV King in the middle of the night?
UNK: You're gonna have to do better than that, Joey.
Joey : You may be allowed to talk to me.
Joey : But I don't have to talk back.
