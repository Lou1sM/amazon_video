Ziff : There's a hole in the wall in the back of the closet.
Beckett : You were spying on her?
Castle : What did you see?
Ziff : Well, that's the thing. I heard all those sounds,
Ziff : but there was nothing going on.
Ziff : It was just her sitting on the bed all night,
Ziff : fully dressed, with her headphones on, typing on her laptop.
Beckett : There wasn't a laptop in the room.
UNK: There used to be. She'd be on it all night, staring at the screen.
UNK: Did you ever see anyone else in there with her?
Ziff : No. It was always just her.
