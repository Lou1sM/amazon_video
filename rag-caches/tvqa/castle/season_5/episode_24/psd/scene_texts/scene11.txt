Ryan : So, what happened at lunch?
Talia : She begged me not to tell anyone that she was in the city.
Talia : That if people found out, she could be in a lot of trouble.
UNK: And did she say why?
Talia : I kept asking her what was going on, but she wouldn't talk about it.
Talia : She said she was on some sort of a mission.
Talia : A mission?
Ryan : This guy that she was arguing with.
Ryan : Do you know who he was or what they were arguing about?
