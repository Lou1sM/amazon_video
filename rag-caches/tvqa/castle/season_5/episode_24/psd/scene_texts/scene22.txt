Tori : For security, the firm replaces its clients' names with codes.
Tori : This one's 47BGO.
UNK: Okay, that firm's never gonna give up that information.
Beckett : Let's see where else that code shows up. Cross-reference it.
UNK: See if we can ID our person from there.
Tory : You don't have to look too far. Blaylock billed that very same client
Tory : for a round of golf the day after the car crash.
Esposito : Well, that would be a perfect place to discuss details.
Esposito : No one would overhear them.
Beckett : So according to the starter at the pro shop,
Beckett : Blaylock was playing golf with another member, Colin Rigsdale III.
Ryan : - Of the Rigsdale political family? - Yeah.
Ryan : Word is, Daddy's grooming him for a state Senate run.
Esposito : Not if this gets out. A fatal car crash with a college chick?
UNK: - Nah, he'd be done. - That's why he was covering it up.
Ryan : With Blaylock's help, until the guilt set in.
UNK: And then Erika started poking around, and people started dying.
UNK: It says here Rigsdale's still represented by Banks and Bauer.
Beckett : Give them a call. Tell them I'm coming.
UNK: Right.
Ryan : Hey. What's going on? Where's Castle?
Esposito : Don't ask.
Beckett : Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Rigsdale.
UNK: Colin Rigsdale Iii : Well, when Jessica told me someone had hacked into their system,
UNK: Colin Rigsdale Iii : I was, of course, concerned.
UNK: Colin Rigsdale Iii : I think we all know what my political opponents might do
UNK: Colin Rigsdale Iii : if they managed to access confidential information.
Banks : So the girl who hacked into our system, did you find out what she was after?
Beckett : Yes, and we also believe we know why she was killed.
