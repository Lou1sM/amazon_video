Castle : Go have fun.
Alexis : Thanks, Dad.
Alexis : Dad, are you okay?
UNK: Yeah.
Alexis : You seem sad.
Castle : No. I'm fine.
Alexis : It's only Costa Rica. I'll be back before you know it.
Castle : Oh, that's sweet, but, no, it's not about that.
UNK: It's something your grandmother told me.
Castle : Comes a point in our lives when we have to stop fooling ourselves
Castle : into thinking life's gonna be the way we want it to be.
Castle : Start seeing things for how they really are.
Martin : So, I was there. So what?
UNK: I needed a place in the city to stay for a couple of nights. Is that a crime?
Beckett : No. But killing a girl is.
UNK: What did your brother promise you, Martin?
UNK: Respectability for the black sheep? A place at the family table...
Martin : I told you, I've never seen this girl before in my life.
Martin : You're wasting your time.
Beckett : Do you have any idea how many people have sat across that table
Beckett : and confessed their sins to me?
