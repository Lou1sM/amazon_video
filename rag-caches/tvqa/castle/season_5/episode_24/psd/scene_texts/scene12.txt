UNK: No.
Talia : I just heard him say,
UNK: "You have no idea what you're up against.
UNK: "These people don't mess around."
Esposito : Can you describe him?
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : Uniforms are canvassing The Cedric. But so far, nobody recognizes him.
Ryan : Here's what I don't get.
Ryan : Why go through all the trouble of creating a fake persona
Ryan : when you're just going to be on your laptop all night?
Castle : Wait. Does The Cedric have Wi-Fi?
Ryan : Yeah, that's about all it has.
Talia : Computer science major, hours on her laptop.
Beckett : She's a hacker. Which is why she was staying at The Cedric.
Beckett : She could pay in cash and remain anonymous
Beckett : - while she was using the IP address. - Exactly.
Castle : And whatever she was hacking into was either so illegal or so dangerous
Castle : she had to make sure they couldn't trace it back to her.
Castle : And even if they did trace it back to her,
Castle : they'd still have to find her amongst hundreds of residents.
Beckett : So she created a whole false persona.
Beckett : And who's going to look twice at a runaway hooker?
Beckett : I mean, she's like the girl with the dragon tattoo.
Castle : Only they did find her. Which is why we can't find her laptop.
