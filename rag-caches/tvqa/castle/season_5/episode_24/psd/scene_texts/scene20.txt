Beckett : This is about me. This is about my life.
Castle : - So you're seriously considering this? - Yes.
Beckett : This is a wonderful opportunity. It'll be a chance to do more.
Castle : Without me.
Beckett : Castle, please don't do this. Please don't make this about us.
Castle : I'm sorry, tell me how this isn't about us.
Castle : You get this job, you move to DC, I'll never see you.
Castle : That's pretty much the end of our relationship, isn't it?
Beckett : You don't know that. And I probably won't even get the job.
UNK: That's not the point. The point is, you knew what this could mean,
Castle : and it didn't occur to you to include me.
Castle : Or worse, it did occur to you,
Castle : and you chose not to.
UNK: Now, what does that say about us?
UNK: Not much, if you ask me.
UNK: Castle.
Castle : I can't be here right now.
Castle : - Hey. - Hey.
Beckett : You okay?
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : Where's Castle?
UNK: Mrs. Albrook : I don't know.
Beckett : We had a fight, okay?
UNK: What, like a regular fight, or...
Esposito : How bad?
Ryan : Hey, guys. We got something.
Tory : Once your victim hacked into the law firm,
Tory : she started with the basics, emails, calendars, payroll.
Tory : Then she moved on to client and personal files.
Esposito : Do we know what she was looking for?
Ryan : Hard to say. But for the last few nights,
Ryan : Erika became very focused on the firm's accounting department.
