Beckett : I didn't tell you about it because it was just an interview
UNK: and I knew that you would be upset.
Talia : Yeah. Yeah. You're damn right I'm upset.
Beckett : Castle, I just wanted to see what was out there. What's wrong with that?
Castle : What's wrong with it is that you hid it from me.
Castle : In fact, you lied about it. I wouldn't do that to you.
Beckett : Castle, this isn't about you.
