UNK: Mr. Albrook : She was supposed to be in Europe, backpacking with her friends.
Beckett : I mean...
UNK: Mr. Albrook : We dropped her off at the airport.
Beckett : - When? - Last Monday.
UNK: The same day she checked into that hotel.
Castle : Any idea what she'd be doing in the city?
UNK: Mrs. Albrook : None. And why would she stay there? My sister has a place in Midtown.
UNK: Were there any personal issues that we should know about?
Beckett : Did she have any problems with drugs or money?
UNK: Erika would never use drugs and she had...
UNK: Mr. Albrook : And she had plenty of money in her bank account for Europe.
Castle : Is it possible she met someone in the city? A new boyfriend?
UNK: She would've told us.
Beckett : Are you sure about that?
UNK: Mrs. Albrook : I don't know anymore.
