Beckett : That guy next door. He was pretty adamant she wasn't.
Castle : So what did he know that the others didn't?
UNK: I already told you what I know.
Beckett : Not everything, Ziff.
Beckett : How did you know she wasn't a prostitute?
UNK: Please. Look, I don't want any trouble.
Beckett : - Did you murder her? - What? No!
Beckett : Then nothing you say is gonna get you into trouble.
UNK: Well, I heard those sounds, you know.
Beckett : Come on, Ziff.
Ziff : There's a hole in the wall in the back of the closet.
Beckett : You were spying on her?
Castle : What did you see?
Ziff : Well, that's the thing. I heard all those sounds,
Ziff : but there was nothing going on.
Ziff : It was just her sitting on the bed all night,
Ziff : fully dressed, with her headphones on, typing on her laptop.
Beckett : There wasn't a laptop in the room.
UNK: There used to be. She'd be on it all night, staring at the screen.
UNK: Did you ever see anyone else in there with her?
Ziff : No. It was always just her.
UNK: Thanks for coming in, Ms. McTeague.
UNK: Of course. I can't believe she's dead.
Esposito : So, how did you know Erika?
Talia : We were friends from Harvard.
Talia : We were both computer science majors.
Ryan : Do you know what she was doing in the city?
UNK: No.
Esposito : But you had lunch with her two days ago. Why?
Talia : It was weird.
Talia : That morning, I was getting coffee from this place in the Village,
Talia : and I saw her in this big argument with some guy.
