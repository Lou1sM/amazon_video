Esposito : The accounting department?
Ryan : It appears that she was looking into lan Blaylock's billable hours records.
Tory : Focusing exclusively on one week last summer.
Beckett : Wait a minute. That's the same week as Pamela Bonner's car accident.
UNK: Right. Now, check it out. The highway patrol determined that
UNK: Pam Bonner's accident occurred between 1 : 30 and 2 : 00 a.m.
UNK: And lan Blaylock billed for an incoming phone call from a client at 1 : 45 a.m.
Esposito : So, you think one of his clients might have been involved.
Esposito : Maybe ran her off the road.
Ryan : According to the highway patrol, it was a one-car accident.
Beckett : You guys, what if Erika was right?
Beckett : What if Pamela wasn't driving drunk or in her high heels?
Beckett : In fact, what if Pamela wasn't driving at all?
Espostio : Someone else was driving.
Espostio : Someone who crashed and didn't want to be blamed for Pam's death.
Espostio : So he put her behind the wheel, fled the scene.
Beckett : And then called their lawyer. Who made that phone call to Blaylock?
