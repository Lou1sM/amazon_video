Freedman : Sorry to keep you waiting, Detective Beckett.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Not a problem, sir. You're a busy man.
Freedman : Tell that to the Attorney General.
Freedman : He just had his first grandchild and now wants to show me pictures.
Freedman : So, Agent Stack spoke very highly of you.
Freedman : Smart, tenacious, innovative thinker.
Freedman : Said you were a good candidate for the opening on the AG investigative team.
Beckett : Well, I appreciate his confidence, sir.
Freedman : You don't agree?
UNK: No, sir, it's just that, um...
Beckett : I'm a Homicide detective. I don't have any federal experience.
Freedman : Attorney General's not looking for federal experience.
