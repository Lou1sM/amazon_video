UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Detective.
Gates : Deputy Director Anthony Freedman calling.
Freedman : Remember? From the interview.
Beckett : Yes, sir. Yes, I do. What can I do for you?
Freedman : You can say yes. Detective, you got the job.
Ryan : Hey, where's Beckett?
Esposito : She took off about an hour ago.
Esposito : Something's going on, but she wouldn't tell me what.
Ryan : Well, I was looking into Rigsdale's known associates
UNK: when I came across this photo.
Ryan : That is Martin Tillage, Rigsdale's half-brother
Ryan : and the black sheep of the family. Look familiar?
Esposito : Yeah, we interviewed this guy. He was one of the guests at The Cedric.
UNK: He must've checked in to try to find her
UNK: and then hung around so his departure didn't look suspicious.
Ryan : He's gotta be our guy.
Esposito : I'll have uniforms pick him up.
Esposito : - See if you can find Beckett. - Yeah.
