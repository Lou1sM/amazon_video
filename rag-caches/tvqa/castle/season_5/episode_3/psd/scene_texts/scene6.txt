UNK: Offered me $500 to be his proxy,
Felix : get unit 317. Very specific, 317.
Epsosito : And what'd you say?
Felix : I said no. $500? I'm not in for the short money.
Felix : Made me curious. 317, why?
Beckett : That was probably Wendell's partner.
Esposito : - Mm-hmm. - And was he at the auction?
Angelica : No, no, no, no, no. I never saw him again.
Beckett : We're gonna need you to sit with a sketch artist.
Beckett : So, Felix alibied out, but...
Castle : Who's that?
Beckett : Wendell's partner. Ryan and Esposito are trying to ID him now.
Beckett : How about you?
Castle : I have ripped through everything in this room big enough to hide a bracelet.
Castle : - You know what I found? - Nothing?
Castle : Absolutely nothing save for these wicked nun-chucks.
