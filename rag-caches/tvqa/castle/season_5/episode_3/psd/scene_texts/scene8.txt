UNK: Murder?
Beckett : Why don't you tell us exactly what happened,
Beckett : and we'll get the DA to cut you a deal.
Beckett : But you better hurry because they're cutting through that safe,

Castle : You know what I love about this case?

Marco : All I did was help him break into that penthouse.

Marco : And by that time, he was already dead.
Marco : So I broke into Wendell's,
