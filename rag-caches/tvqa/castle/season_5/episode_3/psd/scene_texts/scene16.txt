Beckett : Kirby made a full confession.
Beckett : He read an article about a recent mugging in the subway station
Beckett : and decided to kill Wendell there
Beckett : because he knew that the cameras wouldn't be working.
Castle : But the evidence that Wendell stole was still out there,

Castle : Kirby tracked her to the hotel and shot her.
Gates : Worthless bastard.
Pratt : I'm sorry?

UNK: I wonder what those stories are.
UNK: What are you gonna do with all that stuff, Castle?
Castle : Well, I'll give the climbing equipment to Javier
UNK: and then donate the rest, I guess.

Castle : But it just goes to show you that everyone and everything has a story,
UNK: including your little stick-man there.
UNK: So, you wanna take another shot?
Castle : Actually, no.
Castle : I thought about what you said and you're right.
Castle : Just because we've been shaking hands a lot,
Castle : doesn't mean that I have the right to pry.
Castle : So, when you are ready you'll tell me.
Beckett : Coney Island.
Beckett : We had a reception at our place after my mom's funeral
Beckett : and it was miserable.
Beckett : I was miserable and my dad took my hand and he said,
UNK: "Let's get the hell out of here, Katie."
