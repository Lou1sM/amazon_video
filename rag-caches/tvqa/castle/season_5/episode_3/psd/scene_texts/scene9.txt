Marco : but all I found was a key marked "storage unit."
Esposito : And you didn't know where that storage unit was.
Marco : So I kept a close eye on upcoming auctions,
Marco : until I found one with Johan's name.
Marco : As soon as I saw the safe inside,
Marco : I knew that's where he'd stashed that diamond bracelet.
Castle : Oh, I love this part.
Castle : The kick of adrenaline. The quickening of the heart.
Castle : Those last few drops of anticipation.
Beckett : It's empty.
Beckett : So where is the bracelet?
Castle : Wherever it is, it's laughing at me.
Esposito : Maybe Marco was wrong, and Wendell sold it before he was killed.
Ryan : Well, then, where's the money from the sale?
Ryan : No money means there should be a bracelet.
Ryan : No bracelet means there should be money.
Castle : I think the question we should be asking
Castle : is how did Wendell even pull off a heist like this to begin with?
UNK: Angelica said that the thief cracked the wall safe.
Castle : Do you know how hard it is to crack a wall safe?
