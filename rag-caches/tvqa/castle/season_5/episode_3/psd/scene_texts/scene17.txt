UNK: And we took the Q-train and we went up to Coney Island.
Beckett : And we walked up and down that beach just enjoying ourselves.
Beckett : We were still in our funeral clothes.
Beckett : And the best part was that we made this little guy

Castle : Does that make that day a bad memory, or a good one?
UNK: Both.
Beckett : He's a reminder
Beckett : that even on the worst days, there's a possibility for joy.
