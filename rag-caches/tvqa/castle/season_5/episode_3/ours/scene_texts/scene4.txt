UNK: 317. You have 60 seconds to look...
UNK: Yeah, Ryan, so the owner of the unit was a Johan Fleming.
Beckett : Can you run that? Okay, thanks.
Beckett : We need you to stop this auction.
Manager : As much as I'd like to help, I'd like my money more.
UNK: So unless you got a warrant, I don't have to stop jack.
Auctioneer : Okay, 30 seconds.
Beckett : Castle, what do you see?
UNK: Not much. Just a bunch of junk.
Beckett : Yeah, well, the key to Wendy's murder might be in that junk
Beckett : and we're about to lose it.
Castle : There's no way I can get a warrant in time.
UNK: May not have a warrant, but I got something better. Checkbook.
