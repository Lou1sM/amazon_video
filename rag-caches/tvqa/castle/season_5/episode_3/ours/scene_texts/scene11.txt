UNK: And I'm here. And you're there.
UNK: Even though "there" is only 5 miles away,
Alexis : it's not here.
UNK: Well, everything is going to be fine.
UNK: And you are gonna be fine.
Castle : And though I am there,
Castle : if you need me here, here is where I'll be.
Alexis : Hey, Dad.
UNK: I know it's been a while,
Castle : but, um...
Alexis : Could you do it? One last time?
Castle : No monsters.
Alexis : You sure?
Castle : Yeah. And if there are, I'll come running.
Martha : Darling, are you crying?
UNK: No, it's allergies. I... Pollen count is high.
Martha : Pollen count's gotten to me, too.
UNK: Right?
UNK: Ohh.
UNK: Mm.
Castle : You can get home by yourself, right?
Castle : - Well, I... - Thanks! Love you, Mother!
Castle : - I know where it is. - Where what is?
Castle : I don't know what it is, only where it is.
Castle : Whatever Wendell stole was only of value to him and his twin sister.
Castle : So he would hide it in the one place only she would look.
Castle : Wendy, Wendell. Twins, as in Gemini collectibles.
Castle : This is it!
UNK: Castle!
Castle : It's empty. Well, that can't be, right?
UNK: What...
Beckett : Sir, just breathe.
Gates : What the hell have you done?
Felix : I thought...
Gates : You thought what, Mr. Castle?
Castle : I just thought that Wendell would have hidden what he stole...
Gates : It wasn't Wendell's! It was mine! I brought it in from home this morning!
Castle : All right, that's my bad.
UNK: Wait, that means... Here it is.
UNK: Richard Castle : - Don't! - No!
Beckett : A USB drive and a glass eye?
Castle : I didn't see that coming.
UNK: Hey. So the photos from this USB drive are from a crime scene.
UNK: A crime scene where?
Beckett : Mercer, Pennsylvania. They're about a decade old.
Beckett : It was a hit and run.
Esposito : What does any of this have to do with a glass eye?
Esposito : Weren't the twins' parents killed in a car crash 10 years ago?
UNK: Yeah, they were rear-ended and their car went down an embankment.
UNK: Report said that they were trapped inside and bled out,
UNK: and that if the person who hit them would've stopped
Ryan : and called for help, they might have lived.
Beckett : You guys, who took this photo?
Beckett : It's from the crime scene and it's of a broken glass eye.
UNK: What?
UNK: A glass eye? Wait a minute.
Castle : Of course! It all makes sense now.
Beckett : It does?
Castle : Wendell's obsession. Why he moved from place to place.
Castle : Why he came to New York.
