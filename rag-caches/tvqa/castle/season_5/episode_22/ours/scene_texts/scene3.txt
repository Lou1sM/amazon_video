Beckett : Fine. I did have feelings for you when we first met.
Beckett : I couldn't stand you.
Beckett : Do you even remember what you were like in the beginning?
Castle : Well, apparently, I was irresistible.
Beckett : Irresistible? Are you joking?
Beckett : Richard Castle, you are under arrest for obstruction of justice.
Castle : You forgot making you look bad.
Beckett : Cuff him.
UNK: Bondage. My safe word is "apples."
Castle : Do I look like a killer to you?
Beckett : Yes. You kill my patience.
Castle : Guess who's got a date with a prostitute!
Castle : So many lonely women approached me, thinking I was their Tom Hanks.
Castle : - I got laid... - Castle!
Beckett : Don't make me shoot you.
Castle : I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
Beckett : I'm gonna kill you!
Beckett : Do I have to wait for him to sign or can I shoot him now?
Beckett : - How shallow are you? - Very.
Beckett : Call me a muse again, and I will break both your legs,
Beckett : - okay? - Okay.
Beckett : - In your dreams. - Actually, in my dreams,
Castle : you're never jealous. In my dreams, you just join...
UNK: Mmm.
Castle : Okay, if you couldn't stand me when we first met, tell me this.
Castle : Why couldn't you keep your hands off me?
Beckett : What are you even talking about?
Castle : Oh, you know what I'm talking about.
UNK: Okay. Of course. Sure, I'll be right there.
UNK: Ow!
UNK: Ow!
UNK: Apples! Apples! Apples!
Beckett : Hold my hand.
Beckett : That? Castle, that was called survival. We were just huddling for warmth.
Castle : - Cuddling? - Huddling!
UNK: Or one could see it as a small part of a larger pattern.
Castle : Unwanted touching in the workplace.
Beckett : Oh, so you're being harassed, is that it?
UNK: Yeah, you're very lucky.
Castle : A less understanding man would press charges
Castle : with all the inappropriate things you've said to me.
Beckett : Really, like what?
UNK: Oh, jeez! How do you even get in that position?
UNK: Right? It's not even possible.
Beckett : Oh, it's possible.
UNK: Okay. Gauntlet your right fist in your left palm.
Castle : Whoa! Shot too soon.
Beckett : You know, we could always just cuddle, Castle.
UNK: - Did you just use the word "veritable"? - Yes, I did.
Castle : - Sexy. - You should hear me say "fallacious."
Beckett : Closest I ever came
Beckett : to taking an art class was posing for one as a model.
Castle : Wait. Posing in?
Beckett : Not a stitch.
Beckett : What's the matter, Castle? You afraid of a little role play?
UNK: That's it? That's all you got?
Castle : There's more, but on thinking back, I was momentarily distracted
Castle : by your dizzying array of hairstyles over the years. Anyway...
UNK: Oh, Castle. Me in a swimsuit under the hot, blistering sun...
Castle : I'd be happy to rub lotion on you.
Beckett : You think this is crazy,
Beckett : you should see some of the clubs I've been to.
Castle : You know any good tricks?
Beckett : I do this one thing.
Beckett : With ice cubes.
UNK: But there is one hot, wild,
Beckett : kinky thing that I do like doing.
Beckett : Putting killers behind bars.
Beckett : Please. Let's just stick it in and get this over with.
Beckett : That's not how I meant it.
Beckett : I can't help it if you get off by putting things in my mouth.
Castle : See? Like that. I can't even... It's uncanny.
Beckett : Oh, like you've never been inappropriate.
UNK: Me?
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Castle : I've never been anything but a perfect gentleman.
UNK: Really?
Castle : You ever have any fun?
Castle : Let your hair down? Drop your top? A little Cops Gone Wild?
Beckett : You do know I'm wearing a gun?
UNK: Yes, please. Beat my pants off, if you dare.
Castle : - Sex? - I'll explain how that works later.
Castle : Slutty nurse.
