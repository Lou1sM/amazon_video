Beckett : Let's go, Castle.
UNK: Took me, like, six minutes.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : The car's license plate was registered to Archibald Fosse.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Lives alone in a fourth-floor apartment.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : This isn't his first rodeo, either.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : He got in trouble playing the ponies,
UNK: Kevin Ryan : so he took out his bookie with a car bomb six years ago.
Becket : Six years and he's already out?
UNK: Well, he was supposed to do 20 years to life,
Ryan : but his case got overturned on appeal three months ago.
Castle : Any idea about the motivation for last night's bombing?
Ryan : No, we just ID'd him 20 minutes ago.
Ryan : There's a lot we have to learn about him yet.
UNK: Javier Esposito : Yo, Beckett. This is Diego Jiminez.
UNK: Javier Esposito : Uniforms intercepted him on his way up to pay Mr. Fosse a visit.
Beckett : - How do you know him? - I don't, really.
UNK: Diego Jiminez : I've never even met him.
UNK: Diego Jiminez : We connected online.
UNK: Diego Jiminez : I'm a collector.
UNK: Diego Jiminez : He said he had some baseball cards from the '30s he wanted to sell.
UNK: Diego Jiminez : - That's all. - Well, we know this much.
Castle : If Diego had an appointment, Fosse's probably in there.
Swat : - Move! Move! - Go! Go! Go!
UNK: NYPD!
Beckett : Ryan, Espo, he's coming your way.
Ryan : Freeze! NYPD!
UNK: - Stop right there, now! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Esposito : Let me see your hands!
Esposito : Drop it! Drop it now!
Esposito : What is that?
UNK: Why's it flashing?
Esposito : Huh? Answer me!
Esposito : Answer me!
Castle : Baseball cards, just like he said.
Esposito : Beckett, Castle, get out of there now.
UNK: The suspect had some kind of device in his pocket.
Esposito : I think he armed something.
Beckett : Copy that. Everyone out, now. Let's go. You guys, out.
