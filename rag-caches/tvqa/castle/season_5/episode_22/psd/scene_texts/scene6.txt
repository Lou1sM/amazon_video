Beckett : You know, if I have to be stuck not standing on a bomb,
Beckett : then I'm glad I'm stuck with you.
Castle : I know.
UNK: Captain Mahoney : Captain Mahoney, Bomb Disposal Unit.
UNK: Captain Mahoney : Which one of you is Detective Beckett?
Beckett : I'm Detective Beckett. This is Castle.
Mahoney : Castle, you can relax.
UNK: We've X-rayed the entire apartment from the floor below.
Mahoney : There are no other explosives.
Castle : No other explosives. So...
Mahoney : Detective, I'm afraid you've stepped on a sensor plate
Mahoney : wired to a detonator.
Mahoney : Depressing that plate was sort of like cocking the hammer of a gun.
Mahoney : You take your weight off there, it's like pulling the trigger.
