Beckett : but do we really have to...
Castle : And by the way, you may have convinced yourself,
UNK: but You weren't fooling anyone else.
Castle : Not me, and certainly not your friends.
UNK: Really? 'Cause no one ever said anything to me.
Lanie : Girl, I'm gonna smack you.
Lanie : You work side by side every day.
Lanie : He writes a sex scene in his book about you that had me reaching for ice water.
Lanie : Now Little Miss Bride shows up.
Lanie : Don't tell me you're not the least bit jealous.
Beckett : Oh, please. You've been inhaling too many autopsy fluids.
Lanie : Honey, just because you can't see what's going on,
Lanie : doesn't mean everyone else doesn't see what's going on!
Beckett : Shut up!
UNK: Natalie Rhodes : He's into you, but you're determined not to give in to these feelings
UNK: Natalie Rhodes : that you clearly have for him.
UNK: Natalie Rhodes : So he fantasizes about you through his writing.
UNK: Natalie Rhodes : It's literally verbal masturbation.
UNK: No, no, no, no, no, I get it.
Madison : You're hot for Castle.
UNK: You wanna make little Castle babies.
UNK: Despite your little act, you're crazy about him.
Lanie : Oh, what? Was that supposed to be some big secret?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: No.
Beckett : Do you think he knows?
Kyra : He's all yours.
Beckett : Okay, okay. They might have said something, but...
UNK: But they were completely misreading the situation.
UNK: Oh. Much like I must've been misreading the situation all those times
Castle : you dressed up in revealing outfits to try and turn my head.
UNK: "No one..."
Castle : Undercover. I like it.
UNK: You might wanna pop one more button, just in case.
UNK: Is it just my imagination or did you change?
Beckett : Castle, could you get some backup, please?
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : The only reason that I was dressed up was to go undercover.
Castle : Oh, I guess it was just a coincidence
Castle : that each time, I just so happened to be there.
