UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey. You got in late last night. Catch a case?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Actually, it was this one.
Beckett : Someone blew up an apartment downtown.
Castle : Seriously? And you didn't call me?
Beckett : Castle, you said you had a chapter due.
Castle : Yes, which is writer-speak for "all procrastinations welcome."
Castle : So what was it, a terrorist plot? A meth lab?
UNK: Um, the canvass turned up a description of a guy
Beckett : fleeing the scene in a silver hatchback,
UNK: and we called in for traffic-cam footage,
UNK: which is probably already in, so I gotta get going.
UNK: Or you can have Esposito check that out, he's very good at it.
Castle : I feel like I haven't seen you in days.
Beckett : You know, I really do have to get going, but...
Castle : But you're powerless to resist me, you always have been.
Beckett : - Really? - Hmm.
Beckett : Do you remember when we first met? I kinda thought you were an ass.
UNK: Oh, I know you pretended you thought that, but come on.
