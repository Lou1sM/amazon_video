Castle : Why are you standing all the way over there?
UNK: If Fosse set the bomb for the cops,

Castle : The card collector kid. What was his name? Diego.
Castle : He was on his way up here.
Beckett : Maybe Fosse was trying to leverage him for information.
Castle : Okay, great. So, uh, what's near where you're standing?
