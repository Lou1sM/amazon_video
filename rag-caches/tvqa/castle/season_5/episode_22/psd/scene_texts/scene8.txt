Castle : Just the old Indiana Jones bag-of-sand-golden-idol trick.
Beckett : Remember how that turned out?
Mahoney : Look, the plate she's standing on

Mahoney : You try to transfer the weight, you'll set off the bomb.
UNK: Put any kind of protective gear on her, you'll set off the bomb.
Mahoney : She shifts too quickly from one foot to the other...
UNK: Set off the bomb. I get it, thank you. I'm sorry, I was...
Castle : So what are we supposed to do, just stand here?
Mahoney : Not you, Mr. Castle.
Mahoney : All non-essential personnel must evacuate.
Castle : Oh, no. I am essential personnel.
Beckett : Castle, it's okay.
Mahoney : We'll take good care of her.
UNK: I got guys downstairs right now figuring this out.
Mahoney : Meantime, Detective, sit tight. I'll check back with you soon.
Castle : I appreciate it. I'm staying.
Beckett : Castle, please, there is no reason to put yourself in danger.
Beckett : There's nothing that you can do here.
UNK: Nothing?
UNK: Excuse me, who's gonna be your bomb buddy?
Beckett : My bomb buddy?
Castle : You heard what he said.
UNK: You're gonna be standing here, maybe for hours.
