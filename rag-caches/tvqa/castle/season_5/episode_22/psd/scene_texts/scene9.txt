UNK: If I don't stay, who's gonna keep your spirits up?
UNK: Who's gonna take your mind off of getting tired?
UNK: Castle, I'm gonna be fine. I feel fine.
Castle : That would be great,
Castle : if you were a reliable judge of your own feelings,
Castle : which clearly you're not.
Beckett : What does that mean?
Castle : I'm sorry, exhibit A,
Castle : according to you, you felt nothing for me when we first met,
Castle : which we both know...
Beckett : Are you...
Beckett : Oh, I get it. I know what you're doing.
UNK: What?
Beckett : You know what, Castle, forget it. I'm not going down that path.
Beckett : You can just go now.
Castle : Fine, I'll leave.
Castle : If you admit to me you had feelings for me when we first met.
