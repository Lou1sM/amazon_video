Beckett : No, it wasn't a coincidence because you were always following me around.
UNK: Why? 'Cause you were into me.
Castle : - Me into you? - Yeah.
UNK: Mmm. I admit, I found you not unattractive,
Castle : and occasionally fun to be around.
UNK: But into you? Mmm...
Castle : No, definitely not.
Beckett : Okay, fine, then why were you following me around?
Beckett : And don't say that it was research,
Beckett : because no one believed that for a second.
