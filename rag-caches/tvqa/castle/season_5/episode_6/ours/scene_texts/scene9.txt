Castle : And, speaking of fantasies, how about we live out one of yours?
Castle : What do you say to a little Nebula 9 cosplay?
Castle : Come on, it'll be fun.
Castle : I'll serve you breakfast in bed for a week.
Castle : And I'll do your laundry.
Beckett : Okay, fine.
Beckett : Do you really want to see me in one of my old costumes?
Castle : Yes, please.
Beckett : Then you have to promise
UNK: that you're gonna watch a Nebula 9 marathon with me.
UNK: Uh...
UNK: And
Beckett : no making fun.
Castle : You drive a hard bargain, but okay.
Beckett : I'll see you at your place.
Beckett : Okay, promise not to laugh.
Castle : I promise. Come on. Quit stalling. Come out already!
UNK: Ready?
UNK: Ready.
UNK: Do you like it? Huh?
UNK: That's not what you... That's not...
UNK: You wanna make out, Castle?
UNK: No...
Beckett : Come on, just a quick snog, right here on the lips.
Beckett : Isn't this what your dreams are made of?
UNK: Castle, are we gonna make out?
Ryan : Maybe you...
UNK: We should start with the Nebula 9 marathon.
