Audrey : And she...
Davis : She said terrible things.
Davis : She said that I ruined everything, that she was gonna have to tell Audrey.
UNK: And I didn't know what else to do.
UNK: Davis, did you kill Anabelle?
UNK: No.
Davis : No, I was halfway across the building when it happened,
Davis : at the masquerade ball. You can check.
UNK: Look, I tried to make things right with her.
UNK: And I told her I was drunk and we should just forget about it,
Davis : but she couldn't.
Davis : She said it was one thing to live a fantasy,
UNK: but she wasn't gonna live a lie,
UNK: and that this was gonna be our last Con.
UNK: She was gonna end the Fan Experience?
Davis : Not just the Fan Experience. Everything.
Davis : She said it was time to move on.
Davis : She decided to cash out, sell the rights to Nebula 9.
Davis : I mean, they were worthless when she first got them, but she...
Davis : She made the show popular again.
UNK: And they were talking about rebooting the series,
Davis : maybe even doing a movie.
Castle : That would mean some real money.
Beckett : Davis, who gets the rights now that Anabelle's dead?
Davis : They go to Audrey.
UNK: Why?
Beckett : So Davis' alibi checks out.
Castle : - Sort of. - Sort of?
UNK: Yeah. Organizers confirm that he arrived at the party at 9 : 30,
UNK: but everyone was masked. So he could've slipped out at any time.
UNK: Hey. So Anabelle was serious about cashing out.
