UNK: I'm not gonna answer any more of your questions.
Castle : Let's make sure that history
Castle : never forgets the name Enterprise.
UNK: Yeah, okay. Thanks, Ryan.
UNK: So Audrey's hotel keycard was used at 9 : 48 p.m.,
UNK: and then it wasn't used again the rest of the night.
UNK: Well, she could've slipped out and left her door ajar.
UNK: That would've given her enough time to get down here.
UNK: Yeah, but, Castle, all we have is circumstantial evidence and soft alibis.
UNK: We gotta get something more concrete.
Beckett : I can't tell you how many times
Beckett : I have had dreams about being in this very ship.
Castle : Sexy dreams?
Castle : You know, it's never too late to live out your fantasy.
Beckett : You do realize that this is still a crime scene?
Castle : - Oh, right. Ew. - Yeah.
Beckett : You're right, okay? It was a stupid show.
Beckett : It was cheesy and melodramatic.
UNK: I mean, a handful of Academy Cadets on a training mission,
Beckett : and, suddenly, the Earth is destroyed and they're all that's left of humanity?
Beckett : I completely understand why you hated it.
Beckett : But, Castle, I also understand why people loved it.
UNK: Why Anabelle loved it.
Beckett : It was about leaving home for the first time,
Beckett : about searching for your identity and making a difference.
