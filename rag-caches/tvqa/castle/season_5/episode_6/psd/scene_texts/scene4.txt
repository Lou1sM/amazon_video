Audrey : You know, picking up where the show left off. Like, as a tribute.
UNK: And not everyone saw it that way.
UNK: Anabelle got some pretty ugly e-mails.
Castle : How ugly?
Audrey : Some were death threats.
Castle : Davis wasn't kidding about these e-mails.
Castle : Listen to this.
UNK: "Your so-called webisodes desecrate the memory of Nebula 9
UNK: "and you should pay the ultimate price!"
Beckett : I don't know, Castle. Do you honestly believe
UNK: that Anabelle was killed by an angry Nebula 9 fan?
UNK: I think if you like Nebula 9, you're crazy enough to kill, yeah.
Beckett : Whoa, why are you so down on the show?
UNK: Uh, okay, well let's see. Because it's cheesy,
Castle : it ignores the laws of physics and good story-telling, not to mention...
Beckett : Okay, I got it.
UNK: It's Perlmutter. He's got something for us.
Beckett : Kate Beckett!
UNK: K-Bex! I knew it was you!
UNK: Henry Barnett. Well, it's been years.
Henry : Since our first semester at Stanford.
UNK: "K-Bex"?
UNK: Um...
UNK: Uh...
Beckett : Do you think we could catch up later? I'm actually here for work.
Henry : Oh, well, that explains why you aren't wearing your Nebula 9 outfit.
UNK: Uh...
UNK: You have a Nebula 9 outfit?
Henry : Oh, she had a few. She was a megafan.
UNK: You should've seen her as Lieutenant Chloe.
Henry : Oh, wait, you can. Remember that photo we all took?
Henry : - I brought it to get it signed. - May I?
Henry : - It's us from back in the day. - Ooh!
UNK: Isn't it frakking awesome?
UNK: It's frakking something. Henry, I need that photo.
Henry : What? Why?
Beckett : It's official NYPD business.
Beckett : Don't make me ask again.
Winters : Thank you.
UNK: So I was a Nebula 9 fan. Big deal.
Castle : Oh, you were beyond a fan. You dressed up in costume. You.
Beckett : Okay, yes. I was a sci-fi loving, costume-wearing geek.
Beckett : And you know what? Not ashamed of it or of Nebula 9.
