Beckett : so I have to talk to her.
UNK: I was sad to hear about Anabelle.
UNK: I've met her a few times at conventions like this.
UNK: Stephanie Frye : She seemed lovely.
Beckett : We have a witness that saw you and Anabelle go into the ship
Beckett : just before she died.
Stephanie : You don't think...
Beckett : We're just trying to figure out what happened.
Stephanie : Nothing happened.
Stephanie : We talked. It was a quick conversation.
UNK: I had to be on the red carpet at 10 : 00.
Castle : What did you talk about?
Stephanie : Ugh. She asked if I'd be part of this weekend's Nebula 9 Fan Experience.
