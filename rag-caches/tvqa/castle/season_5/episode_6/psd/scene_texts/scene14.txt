Ryan : She had an offer on the table from EpicScope Productions.
Esposito : She'd been refusing to sell for months,
Esposito : but the day she died, she put in a call saying she was ready to make that deal.
Beckett : - For how much? - Two and a half million dollars.
Beckett : - That's motive. - That's madness.
UNK: Two-point-five mill for that God-awful show?
Ryan : But, now that she's dead, they're gonna have to pay Audrey.
Esposito : And she didn't even wait for the body to get cold.
UNK: The morning after Anabelle was killed Audrey put in a call to EpicScope.
Ryan : They closed the deal today.
