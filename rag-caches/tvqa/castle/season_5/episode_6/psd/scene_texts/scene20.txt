UNK: Uh, Ms. Frye, would you do me the honor of a little improvisation?
Winters : Trust me, that woman needs a script.
Stephanie : I'm happy to help.
UNK: Ms. Frye will be playing Anabelle Collins.
Castle : I will be the killer.
UNK: Anabelle had the murder weapon on her the night she died.
Castle : Don't worry, this one's just a toy.
UNK: Now, the killer confronts Anabelle.
UNK: Anabelle, presumably to protect herself, drew her blaster.
