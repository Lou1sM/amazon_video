Beckett : Okay, promise not to laugh.
Castle : I promise. Come on. Quit stalling. Come out already!
UNK: Ready?
UNK: Ready.
UNK: Do you like it? Huh?
UNK: That's not what you... That's not...
UNK: You wanna make out, Castle?
UNK: No...
Beckett : Come on, just a quick snog, right here on the lips.
Beckett : Isn't this what your dreams are made of?
UNK: Castle, are we gonna make out?
Ryan : Maybe you...
UNK: We should start with the Nebula 9 marathon.
