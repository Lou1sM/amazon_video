Beckett : If they do make a movie, I'm gonna be first in line to see it.

Castle : And, speaking of fantasies, how about we live out one of yours?
Castle : What do you say to a little Nebula 9 cosplay?
Castle : Come on, it'll be fun.
Castle : I'll serve you breakfast in bed for a week.
Castle : And I'll do your laundry.

Castle : Yes, please.
Beckett : Then you have to promise
UNK: that you're gonna watch a Nebula 9 marathon with me.
