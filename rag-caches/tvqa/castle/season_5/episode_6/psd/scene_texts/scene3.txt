UNK: So when Anabelle started the fan club,
Davis : we helped out, and it just kind of took off from there.
Castle : Did you notice any unusual behavior lately?
Audrey : I saw her yesterday morning and she seemed really upset.
Beckett : - About what? - I don't know.
Audrey : All she said was that someone she had trusted had betrayed her.
Beckett : Any idea who? Was she involved with anyone?
Audrey : Not that I know of.
UNK: Did Anabelle have any enemies?
Davis : There were those fans. The ones that sent all the threats.
Beckett : What threats?
UNK: After the fan club took off,
UNK: Anabelle bought the rights to the show for practically nothing,
UNK: and started making new Nebula 9 webisodes, starring the three of us.
