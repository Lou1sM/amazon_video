Gates : Well, it backfired.
Gates : And I am willing to forget that this ever happened
UNK: if you assure me that you can tame your childish nonsense
UNK: and accord me some respect.
Castle : I will. I can. I will.
Gates : And now I will go home
Gates : to my husband,
Gates : because I'm his Valentine.
Beckett : She already hated you, Castle,
Beckett : so it doesn't sound like you're any worse off.
Castle : I do respect the way she handled it, though.
Castle : Strong. Decisive.
Castle : I feel like somehow it brought us closer.
Castle : I am sorry about the earrings, though.
UNK: Yeah, me, too. They were stunning.
UNK: Hmm. I will get you something else
Castle : even more beautiful.
Castle : Just try not to give it to another woman first.
Beckett : That would be nice.
Castle : - Which reminds me... - Hmm?
Castle : What did you get me?
Beckett : Open it.
Castle : Maybe it's in another drawer.
Beckett : It is the drawer.
Beckett : It's your drawer.
Beckett : I mean, I know it's not a lightsaber.
UNK: No.
Castle : It's perfect.
Beckett : Happy Valentine's Day.
UNK: Now take your clothes off,
Beckett : put them in your drawer,
Beckett : and meet me in the bed.
UNK: Seriously?
