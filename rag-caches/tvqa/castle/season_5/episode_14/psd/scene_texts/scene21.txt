UNK: Stone,
Castle : did your mother go after her?
UNK: No.
Stone : As soon as Hannah left, I knew I'd made a mistake.
Stone : So, I ran out to catch up with her in the street.
Stone : And I kissed her, I told her I loved her.
Stone : But she said it was too late.
Stone : She never wanted to see any of us again.
Beckett : Can anyone verify your whereabouts
Beckett : after you and Hannah went your separate ways?
Stone : I took a long walk, so no.
Gates : So, what do you think? Do you believe him?
Castle : He had motive, she was leaving him.
Beckett : And he was the last one to see her alive,
Beckett : a block away from where she was killed, so...
Gates : Only problem is
Gates : we don't have any proof.
