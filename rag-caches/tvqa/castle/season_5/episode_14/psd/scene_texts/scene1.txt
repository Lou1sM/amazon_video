UNK: Hannah Green : It's not always fair.
Peter : That's it.
Peter : That's the last image we shot of Hannah.
Peter : Poor girl.
Peter : Such a loss.
Peter : She was ratings gold.
UNK: You're gonna have to find who did this. The audience will wanna know.
Castle : Yeah, not to mention her family, the DA...
Beckett : Mr. Monroe, when was this shot?
UNK: Uh, day before yesterday. Around 8 : 00 p.m. Why?
Beckett : Because she's wearing the same clothes that we found her in.
Beckett : That's a full day later.
Beckett : Do you know where she went after filming
UNK: or why she would've been on the Upper West Side?
Peter : Well, to be honest, when the cameras go away, so do I.
Peter : So I don't even know what she did on her free time.
Castle : In the video, she seems upset. Any idea what about?
Peter : You gotta understand,
Peter : we brought Hannah in to be Penelope's assistant.
Peter : You know, mix things up a little bit.
UNK: The small-town girl with the big-time dreams
Peter : of becoming a fashion designer.
