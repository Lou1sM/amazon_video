Gates : We can't tie Stone to the crime scene.
Ryan : Actually, we can.
Ryan : On a hunch, I took a look at his wedding registry.
UNK: Turns out that Ashley and Stone were registered
Ryan : for a set of Takahara VG knives,
UNK: including the 240-millimeter, which shipped out three weeks ago.
Castle : The lab report did say that it was a new knife.
Gates : - Then that seals it. - No, not necessarily.
Beckett : We're forgetting wedding etiquette.
Beckett : The gifts don't go to the groom.
Beckett : Thank you for coming, Ashley.
Ashley : Anything I can do to help.
Beckett : You must be so busy planning for the wedding right now
Beckett : and dealing with all of the gifts.
Gates : Oh, yeah.
