Beckett : Well, we know that your cousin bought you that set of Takahara VG knives,
Beckett : the ones that you have on your registry.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : The funny thing is when we went to your apartment,
UNK: you don't have the 240-millimeter.
Castle : Isn't it just a little weird that she wouldn't get you the whole set?
Ashley : You were in my apartment?
Beckett : Yeah, we also went to your ceramics studio as well.
Castle : Your work is lovely, by the way.
Castle : The colors of your glazes are stunning.
Castle : I mean, it must take a lot of work to get them just right. A lot of chemicals.
