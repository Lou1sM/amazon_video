Lanie : - Good memory. - So, her wrists were tied together.
Lanie : Tight, and for several hours.
Beckett : Now it's making sense. Wearing the same clothes overnight.
Castle : The radio silence.
Beckett : And the defensive wounds 24 hours prior to death.
Castle : Hannah was held hostage.
Beckett : If Hannah was being held hostage, then why didn't she report it?
Ryan : And how did she get magically transported to Madagascar?
Castle : And why would she go afterwards to Margo's
Castle : to apologize for missing work?
Beckett : It has to have something to do with those $5,000 payments
Beckett : and that meeting with that mystery man at the bar in Brooklyn.
Castle : It all seems so random.
Castle : I mean, I know by the end of this,
UNK: all of these clues will fit together beautifully in a murderous mosaic.
Castle : But how?
UNK: Wait!
Castle : Is this your Valentine's Day gift to me?
Castle : A complex mystery where nothing makes sense?
Castle : You know me so well.
Esposito : I hate to interrupt your little, uh, love connection,
Esposito : but I checked traffic cameras.
Esposito : I found footage of Hannah arriving at Margo's building in a taxi.
Esposito : I got the medallion and talked to the cabbie
Esposito : whose log showed that he picked up Hannah at 78th and Lex.
Beckett : Did he say where she was coming from?
Beckett : - Building, store? - He didn't know.
UNK: He said she was standing on the corner when she flagged him down.
Ryan : Well, then, she could've come from anywhere.
