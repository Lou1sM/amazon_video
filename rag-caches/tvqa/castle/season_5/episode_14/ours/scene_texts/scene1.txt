UNK: I should've done more.
Charlie : I was her brother. I should've protected her.
Ryan : Mr. Green, when was the last time you talked to Hannah?
Charlie : Few days ago. I called her. We fought.
Esposito : About what?
Charlie : The usual.
Charlie : About how she was putting her life out there for the world to see.
Charlie : What it was doing to the family. She...
Charlie : She said I didn't understand,
Charlie : that there was more going on than I knew.
Charlie : But to me it was simple. She needed to come home.
Ryan : So you didn't approve of her being on The Wives of Wall Street?
Charlie : Approve? No. It was killing us.
Charlie : See, the choices she made, the way she was living her life,
Charlie : all of it out there on national television.
Charlie : And that was before she started having the affair.
