Bob : I didn't kill her!
Stone : Don't you guys get it?
Stone : I was in love with her.
Castle : Whoa, love?
Castle : What about Ashley?
Stone : That was my mom's idea.
Stone : Look, I like Ash.
Stone : We've known each other since we were kids.
UNK: But...
Stone : Then I met Hannah.
Stone : We bonded over being forced into things that weren't really us.
Beckett : Did anyone else know about the two of you?
Stone : No. There was too much at stake.
Stone : For the past few weeks,
Stone : Hannah just couldn't take it anymore,
Stone : what the show was doing to her, her family.
Castle : She was looking for a way out.
Stone : We both were.
Stone : But the lies had just gotten so big.
Stone : Her fake affair, my engagement.
Stone : Ash and my mom,
Stone : they were counting on that spin-off.
Beckett : What happened the night that Hannah showed up?
Stone : She was hysterical.
Stone : She said she wanted to leave town right away.
Stone : That it was now or never.
Stone : And I was going to, but...
Beckett : But what?
Stone : Then my mom came home.
Stone : When she found out about our relationship,
Stone : she went crazy. She threw Hannah out.
Stone : But the worst part
Stone : was that Hannah begged me to go with her.
Stone : But I couldn't.
UNK: In the moment when she needed me
Stone : to stand up to my mother,
Stone : I couldn't.
UNK: Stone,
Castle : did your mother go after her?
UNK: No.
