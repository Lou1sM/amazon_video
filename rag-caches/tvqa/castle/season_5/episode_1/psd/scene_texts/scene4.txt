Castle : If we don't get to him before Maddox does, you will never be safe again.
UNK: This guy who Maddox is looking for, he's the key.
Ryan : We find him, we find Montgomery's file.
Castle : Which could lead to who's behind this whole thing,
Castle : including your mother's murder.
UNK: But in all the times you talked, he never gave you a name,
Ryan : - even a fake one? - No.
UNK: - Or where he worked? Where he lived? - No.
Castle : No, nothing like that.
Castle : He called my cell phone.
UNK: Uh... Two nights ago.
Castle : But from a blocked number.
Ryan : I'll run your phone records,
Ryan : see if I can trace the number he called from.
Beckett : This was supposed to be over.
Beckett : I can't go back again. Not now.
Castle : Well, now we don't have a choice. If Maddox gets to him before we do...
Beckett : But I don't know how to do this.
Beckett : I'm not even a cop anymore.
Castle : I'll tell you exactly what we do.
Castle : We figure out who this is.
Castle : We've done it before, and with less to go on.
Castle : And when we do, we'll lay all of this to rest
Castle : and we go back to where we were.
Castle : This is what you're great at.
Castle : And I'm not so bad myself.
Castle : So, what do we know?
Castle : We know this guy is about 60. He's a longtime New Yorker.
UNK: Uh... Friends with Montgomery,
UNK: so he may have connections to law enforcement.
Beckett : He, um...
Beckett : He seems prominent.
UNK: Wealthy.
Castle : That's right.
Castle : And he has been that way ever since this photo was taken.
Beckett : - How do you know that? - Look at his wrist.
Castle : That's a Nautilus 3800.
UNK: It was 10 grand when it came out in 1981.
Castle : That's the year Montgomery was married, May of 1981.
Castle : How many of these watches could possibly have been sold in five months?
