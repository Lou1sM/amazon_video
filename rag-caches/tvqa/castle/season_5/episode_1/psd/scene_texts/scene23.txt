Ryan : We need to talk to Senator Bracken.
UNK: Security Man : He's in a meeting with a donor.
Castle : What donor? Where is he?
UNK: Security Man : He didn't say.
Esposito : Who you calling?
Ryan : - Gates? - Um...
Esposito : Put that phone away or I'm gonna break your frigging arm.
Ryan : Javi, we can't let her throw her life away.
Castle : - We don't know she's doing that. - What do you mean?
UNK: You're the one who said she was gonna kill the guy!
UNK: Hey, I know. Yes, that's right, but...
UNK: But she hasn't done that yet, right?
Castle : Look, you make that call, you're labeling her an assassin.
Castle : That's a bell you can't unring.
Castle : So, let's not make that call, not yet.
Castle : All right.
