Ryan : I still am.
Ryan : And this guy that threw you off the roof, he's still out there.
UNK: Hey. Ryan.
Ryan : I know what this case has done to you.
Ryan : I'm not asking you to jump back in.
Ryan : I just want to show you something, that's all.
UNK: I found a copy of the photo Maddox took from the wedding album.
Ryan : You're familiar with the guys that Roy ran with back in the day.
Ryan : - Is he one of them? - I've never seen him before.
Castle : I have.
Castle : This is the man I told you about, the one who's been keeping you safe.
Beckett : Are you sure?
Castle : He's older now but it's definitely him.
Ryan : What are we talking about here?
Castle : Whatever information Montgomery gave to him,
Castle : he's been using it to protect you.
Castle : But now they've sent Maddox to hunt him down and get it back.
