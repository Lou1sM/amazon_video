Beckett : So then people started dying.
UNK: Now, this would explain why he's coming after you right now.
Castle : Word is, Bracken's being groomed to run for President.
Esposito : He's trying to clean house, and you're next.
Esposito : - We need to take him down. - How?
Becket : All we have are a bunch of numbers that are meaningless to anyone but us.
Becket : We have absolutely no hard evidence against him.
Ryan : I may have the next best thing.
Ryan : I just got word that Michael Smith is out of surgery.
Ryan : And he's awake.
Castle : Smith is the key. He can connect all this to Bracken.
Beckett : Okay, Castle and I are gonna go talk to him.
Beckett : You guys see if you can find a link between Maddox and Bracken.
UNK: Ryan call you?
Officer : Yeah, he did.
Smith : You're alive.
Castle : Join the club.
Smith : What about the other file?
Castle : Maddox opened the safe.
Beckett : We put enough of it together to know that Bracken took dirty money.
Smith : Close the door.
Smith : The irony is, he used that money to finance
Smith : his first Congressional campaign.
UNK: We need proof of that,
Beckett : along with anything else that he did.
Smith : There is no proof.
Beckett : Well, there's you. You can testify.
Smith : That will never happen.
Smith : You see, Roy Montgomery once did me a favor.
UNK: So I kept that file and I protected you at great personal cost.
Smith : Because I owed Roy.
Smith : But I don't owe you.
UNK: So you're just gonna let him get away with murder?
Smith : You don't understand, Detective.
Smith : He's protected. Untouchable.
UNK: You're just gonna end up dead.
