Bracken : When I was 14,
Bracken : I got to be friends with this boy in the neighborhood, Lamar Dokes.
Bracken : Sweet kid.
Bracken : I used to help him with his homework after school.
Bracken : Well, one day, he doesn't come to school.
Bracken : So I went by his apartment, and the door was open.
Bracken : I walked in.
Bracken : And I found Lamar lying on his mattress, dead.
Bracken : His little sister, the same way.
