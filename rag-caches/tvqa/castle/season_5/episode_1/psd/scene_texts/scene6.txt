UNK: As soon as we're done, I'll wipe the drive.
Esposito : Ditch the box. It will never come back to you.
Esposito : He's former Army. Special Forces, Delta, I don't know.
Esposito : This guy shot a friend of mine, almost killed her.
Esposito : He's gonna keep coming unless he's stopped.
Esposito : I need to ID him.
Esposito : You need to help me.
Castle : Okay. Yes. Thank you.
Castle : All right, watch company says that 17 of the 3800s
Castle : were sold in New York in 1981 between January and May.
Beckett : And did they give you names of any of these clients?
UNK: No, but nine of the 17 watches
Castle : were given as gifts to a legal team at the law firm of PPC
Castle : after they won a civil suit against Big Tobacco.
Beckett : Winning a tobacco lawsuit would get a lot of publicity.
Castle : With any luck, we'll ID this guy before Ryan even traces that call.
Martha : What do you mean you can't trace the call?
Ryan : Why the hell not?
Ryan : Look, I'm on the clock here. I need to know who made that call now.
UNK: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just put Officer Hoben on.
Ryan : He's the guy I usually deal with over there.
Beckett : Okay, so this is the PPC legal team that won the suit, but I don't see him.
UNK: Well, it was a nine-man team. There's only eight here.
Castle : He must be the missing lawyer.
Beckett : Or he's not a lawyer at all.
Castle : Or he is a lawyer,
UNK: but he operates behind the scenes.
UNK: He would be a "of counsel." Like Michael Clayton.
Beckett : Castle, this photo is 30 years old.
Beckett : We have no idea if this guy still works at that law firm,
Beckett : Or if he ever worked there at all.
