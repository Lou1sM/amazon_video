UNK: Captain Victoria Gates : So, any progress on Beckett's shooter?
UNK: We searched his rental car.
UNK: Detective Kevin Ryan : We still have no idea where he was going
UNK: Detective Kevin Ryan : or even what his real name was.
UNK: Detective Kevin Ryan : But we did find out what he stole from Captain Montgomery's house.
UNK: The Montgomerys' wedding album?
Gates : Why did Maddox want this?
UNK: I'm guessing he wanted this missing photograph.
Ryan : It's possible he was after whoever was in it.
Gates : Have you been able to track it down?
Ryan : Well, I've got Evelyn Montgomery bringing the negatives in.
UNK: But truth is, I'm a one-man band here. I could use a few more investigators.
Gates : Well, you can take it up with the Vice President.
Gates : I've already lost half my people to his security detail,
Gates : and I'm about to lose the rest to traffic control.
Gates : So for right now you're on your own.
