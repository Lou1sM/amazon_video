Ryan : Can I get a 20 on Senator Bracken?
Ryan : He's hosting a fundraiser at the Widmark Hotel.
Castle : Ask if anyone else has called to check on him.
Ryan : Did anyone call to check on him?
Ryan : Okay, thanks.
Ryan : Beckett phoned them an hour ago.
UNK: She's gonna kill Senator Bracken.
Beckett : - Hey, Hastings. - Hey, Detective Beckett.
UNK: Officer Hastings : They got you on security detail, too?
Beckett : Yeah, you know, I need to speak with someone.
Beckett : You think I could jump this line?
Hastings : For you, of course.
Castle : Thank you.
Bracken : Good to see you. Are you with me on that?
Bracken : I'm supposed to be kissing babies.
UNK: You're wasting your time, Detective.
Beckett : You have no idea what you're up against.
UNK: You woke the dragon.
UNK: And this is so much bigger than you realize.
UNK: This is my spot, Kate.
UNK: This is where I stand.
Bracken : Are you with me on that?
Castle : - Yeah! - Thank you.
UNK: Excuse me, just for one minute, please.
UNK: Hello?
Beckett : This is Kate Beckett.
Beckett : I can see you know the name.
Beckett : That's right. I'm watching.
