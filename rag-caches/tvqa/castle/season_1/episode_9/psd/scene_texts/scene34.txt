UNK: Castle?
Castle : Go back to sleep.
Castle : What are you doing?
Castle : When Alexis was little,
Castle : she had a stuffed monkey that she could not live without.
UNK: One time we went on vacation, she forgot to pack him.
UNK: I bought her another one, but she knew it was not Monkey-Bunkey.
Beckett : - So? - So,
Castle : there's two more pictures of her clutching this bunny out there.
Castle : So where's the bunny?
Beckett : You think whoever took Angela knew her well enough to take the bunny, too?
Beckett : But we already checked the Candelas' list.
Beckett : Couple of teenage babysitters, a cleaning lady.
Beckett : They're all being cleared.
Castle : Only not all babysitters are teenagers. Sometimes they're people close to us.
Castle : Sometimes they're family.
