Sorenson : I meant to call.
Sorenson : Must've picked up the phone a dozen times.
Beckett : Yeah, I know. You meant to do a lot of things.
Beckett : That's why you left, remember?
Sorenson : Boston was a great opportunity.
Beckett : I'm not saying that it wasn't. I'm just saying it was a choice
Beckett : that didn't include me.
Sorenson : - You could've come. - And then done what?
Beckett : Join the Boston PD, and then you have to move to Phoenix
Beckett : and then Cleveland. And then you're back here.
Beckett : I mean, we both know what that life is all about.
Sorenson : Didn't stop me from missing you.
Sorenson : Missing us.
Sorenson : Sundays in the park.
Sorenson : Those ridiculous neon ice skates at Rockefeller Center.
