UNK: Sorenson.
UNK: On my way.
UNK: Sorenson cont'd : Another call about the ransom.
UNK: They asked for 75 packs of $ 100s
UNK: with randomized serial numbers
UNK: and warned against bait money, dye packs and trackers.
Castle : Sounds like they know your playbook.
UNK: Fbi Tech crawford : They were detailed, down to the make, model and color of the backpack.
Beckett : - Drop instructions? We wait for their call.
Sorenson : All right, let's get the money set and be ready to make the drop.
Alfred : But why didn't they tell us where to bring the money?
Beckett : They're testing you. It's not unusual.
UNK: Which means, before we make the drop, we'll need to test them.
UNK: We'll need proof that they have Angela and that she's okay.
Alfred : What if they don't give any?
Alfred : - What if they refuse? - How can you think that?
Beckett : - I'm just saying... - You think she's dead?
Alfred : - No. Of course not. - I should've gotten up.
Theresa : I shouldn't have let you watch her. Don't tell me what to say!
Theresa : Tell me, Alfred, was it worth it? Was it worth our little girl?
UNK: Castle cont'd : Oh, my God...
Beckett : Mrs. Candela?
Beckett : Theresa, you can't give in to your fear.
Beckett : Neither you nor your husband is responsible for what happened.
