Sorenson : Once they get paid, there's no incentive to keep her alive.
Sorenson : So I'll make the drop.
Sorenson : Figure we'll place our people at a one-block radius from the mailbox.
Alfred : No. They said no cops.
Sorenson : It's okay. I've done this before. They won't know I'm an FBI agent.
Alfred : And if they do?
Beckett : Mr. Candela, we need this to go as smoothly as possible.
Alfred : She's my daughter and we're going to follow their instructions to the letter.
Alfred : They said no cops.

Alfred : I'm her father
Alfred : and I can do this.
Alfred : Do I make myself clear?
