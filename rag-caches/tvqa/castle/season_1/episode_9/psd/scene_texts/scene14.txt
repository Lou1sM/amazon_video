Martha : No wonder you're so surly.
Martha : Those poor parents, having a child ripped away.
Martha : I can't imagine how they must feel.
Castle : - Is Alexis home? - She's upstairs.
Castle : - Feeling a deep-seated need for a hug. - Perfectly understandable.
Martha : After all, we are pod-mates. Another Martha-ism.
UNK: I call it the pea-pod bond.
Martha : You know, the bond that exists between parent and child,
Martha : you and me, you and Alexis.
Martha : We're all peas in a pod, and, whether we like it or not,
Martha : everyone who's ever had a child is in the pod forever.
UNK: - The pea-pod bond. - Yeah.
Castle : - Alexis! Thank you, Mother. - Oh.
Castle : I'll deduct my session fee from your rent.
Martha : What? Whoa, whoa. You might want to consider the year-long package.
Martha : It's a bargain.
Alexis : - What was that for? - Just a pea-pod thing.
UNK: Grandma'll explain.
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Sorenson re : Hey, yourself. Want some?
