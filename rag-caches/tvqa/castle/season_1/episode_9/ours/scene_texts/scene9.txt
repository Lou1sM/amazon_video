Beckett : The kidnappers posted an ad on Craigslist and said that this was
Beckett : a performance art piece for YouTube.
Sorenson : They sent out nearly two dozen of the backpacks.
Sorenson : The poster used an IP anonymizer, making it impossible to trace.
Alfred : So we just do nothing.
Castle : Well, I managed to slip the phone that the kidnappers gave me
UNK: inside the backpack.
Beckett : I don't understand.
Castle : Well, before I did that, I sent a text message to Detective Beckett.
Beckett : The phone's under a bulk account, so we can't trace its owner,
Beckett : but we can trace its ID.
