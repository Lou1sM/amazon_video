Castle : Morning. Grande skim latte, two pumps sugar-free vanilla and a bear claw.
Beckett : - How did you know... - I'm a novelist.
Castle : It's my job to notice things.
Beckett : It's Sunday morning. Shouldn't you be slinking home
Beckett : from a scandalous liaison?
Castle : - Would you be jealous if I were? - In your dreams.
Castle : Actually, in my dreams, you're never jealous. In my dreams, you just join...
UNK: Mmm.
UNK: Castle cont'd : So, Montgomery called and said, "Come down right away,"
UNK: Castle cont'd : so it must be gruesome.
Beckett : Try not to get so giddy every time we go to a crime scene, okay?
Castle : 'Cause somebody's dead doesn't mean you have to be grumpy.
Beckett : Oh, do you want to see grumpy?
Beckett : How about the cover art for your new novel?
Castle : Nikki Heat cover art? That's only available to...
UNK: Oh, my God, you subscribed to my Web site?
UNK: Castle cont'd : Wait a minute, are you CastleFreak1212? CastleLover45?
Beckett : You do realize that most people would be creeped out
Beckett : by crazy anonymous fans.
Castle : Like you.
Beckett : It was strictly professional curiosity.
Castle : So, what did you think of your alter ego, Nikki?
Castle : Pretty sweet, right?
UNK: Sweet? She's naked.
Castle : She's not naked. She's holding a gun.
UNK: Strategically.
Beckett : You know...
Beckett : I take comfort in the fact that, if they're already publishing the cover art,
UNK: then your book, and our little partnership, is almost done.
