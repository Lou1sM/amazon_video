Laurie : It's not supposed to be like this.
Nesbit : We were friends. And we were gonna change the world.
Beckett : Frank Nesbit, you are under arrest for the murder of Jeff Horn.
Nesbit : What? That's ridiculous.
Beckett : Mrs. Horn doesn't think so. Cuff him.
Esposito : Mr. Nesbit, you have the right to remain silent. Any...
UNK: Hey! Hey! Hey!
Ryan : Stop running, bro. Campaign's over.
UNK: Yes.
Esposito : Wasn't quite finished back there, Mr. Nesbit.
Esposito : You have the right to remain silent.
UNK: Anything you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Beckett : After we found the weapon in Nesbit's office, he made a full confession.
Beckett : He got Horn to call her husband and get him down to the overpass,
Beckett : and then he took care of the rest.
Castle : Politics was Nesbit's life.
Castle : He figured if the scandal broke, his career would be over
Castle : and he'd be damaged goods.
Montgomery : Sad thing is, he was probably right. So what happens to the girls?
Beckett : Horn had a sister upstate.
Beckett : She's coming down tomorrow to pick them up from Social Services.
Montgomery : - Good. And the rug? - A red herring.
Castle : Nesbit heard they were dumping a bunch of them,
Castle : and figured it would keep us off his trail.
Montgomery : Nice work. Very impressive.
UNK: Oh, and you, too, Beckett.
UNK: Sir?
Montgomery : Just yanking your chain, Detective. Just yanking your chain.
Castle : Where am I supposed to be?
Alexis : Fire ants? Eyeballs?
UNK: Right! Stall for me. I'm on my way.
Castle : Sorry, sorry.
Castle : "She stood there in stunned disbelief
UNK: "as the light in his eyes dimmed.
UNK: "He reached out for her, and she took his hand,
UNK: "squeezing it for the very last time.
UNK: "She felt her heart stop a beat, and in that moment,
UNK: "she knew he was gone.
UNK: "Darkness fell across the face of the city, and across her face, as well.
UNK: "'Good,' she thought, as the wind gathered up her hair.
UNK: "'No one
UNK: "'will see my tears. "'
Beckett : Thank you.
Laurie : Thank you, thank you.
Beckett : I don't know if I would say that that was the most...
Officer : Detective Beckett.
Castle : To what do I owe this very unexpected pleasure?
Beckett : Excuse me. Thank you.
UNK: I just figured, if you're gonna bother me at my work,
Beckett : I should bother you at yours.
Beckett : That was quite a reading. Very moving.
Castle : Are you making fun of me?
UNK: "'Good,' she thought, as the wind gathered up her hair.
UNK: "'No one will see my tears. "'
Beckett : How does wind gather up hair? I'm just curious.
Castle : Oh, you're telling me how to do my job?
Beckett : - Irritating, isn't it? - Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, look at you.
Martha : And look, everyone is buying your book.
UNK: Now, don't you feel silly for believing all those reviews?
Castle : Yes. Yes, I do.
UNK: Oh, let's just hope Nikki Heat does as well.
UNK: - "Nikki Heat"? - The character he's basing on you.
UNK: - "Nikki Heat"? - Uh-oh!
Beckett : - Can I talk to you for a second? - Of course.
UNK: I wanna hear.
UNK: - What kind of a name is "Nikki Heat"? - A cop name.
Beckett : - It's a stripper name. - Well, I told you she was kind of slutty.
Beckett : - Change it, Castle. - Well, hang on a second.
Beckett : - Change the name. - No.
Castle : - Yes. - No.
Beckett : - Change it. - No.
Beckett : - Castle? - I'm sorry.
Castle : I have artistic integrity, Beckett.
UNK: "Artistic integrity?"
Beckett : - Change the name, Castle. Today. If I cave now, what next?
Castle : What next?
