UNK: Richard Castle : - Hi! - Hi.
UNK: There's something I need to show you.
Castle : I found this in the archives from his first run for office.
Castle : See, Horn wasn't wealthy, but his wife came from money.
UNK: She tapped into her family trust to finance his first campaign.
UNK: All this time we thought that Horn was hiding his affair from his wife.
UNK: Yeah. But what if she knew about the affair?
