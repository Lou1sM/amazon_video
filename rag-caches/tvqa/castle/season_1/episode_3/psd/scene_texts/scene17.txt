Esposito : Detective Beckett, we cross-referenced Horn's campaign payouts
UNK: to the volunteers and employees at Bollinger's office.
Beckett : - And? - There were a series
UNK: of off-book payments totaling 30 grand,
UNK: routed bank-to-bank with no payee, just an account number.
Beckett : Were you able to track down the account?
UNK: Oh, yeah. It's Bruce Kirby.
Esposito : That PI that took the pictures. He is your blackmailer.
UNK: - Did you run him up? - Of course. Real peach.
Esposito : Lost his badge for excessive force. On probation for criminal intimidation.
Ryan : And he has registration for a. 38.
UNK: Same caliber that killed Councilman Horn.
Ryan : Oh, that's good. That's the stuff.
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : - It's good, man. - Flavor country.
UNK: The gutless punk isn't gonna use them, why the hell shouldn't I?
Esposito : Because it's illegal.
Kirby : Hey, I'm not the one that was dipping my churro in sugar
Kirby : nearly half my age. The guy had it coming.
Beckett : Except he found you out. He came after you.
