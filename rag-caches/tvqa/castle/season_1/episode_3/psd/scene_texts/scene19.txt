UNK: Well, I thought, "What the hell?" 250,000.
Kirby : I never thought he'd say yes. He did. He got the money.
Kirby : The night he was killed, he was coming to meet me with it.
Kirby : He never showed.
Beckett : What do you think?
Montgomery : Waiting to receive a blackmail payoff from the vic?
UNK: My three-year-old son could come up with a better story than that.
UNK: It's so bad it might be true.
UNK: Yeah, well, we got a team tossing his place for the weapon.
Montgomery : Book him on the blackmail till we see what the search turns up.
Montgomery : In the meantime, follow the money. If this bozo's telling the truth...
UNK: Then Horn had a quarter-million dollars on him when he was killed.
Esposito : Yeah, so where's the money?
Montgomery : And where does an underpaid public servant get it from in the first place?
UNK: Well, he'd go where all politicians go.
Castle : To people who like him, people who gave him money before.
UNK: What happened to Jeff Horn was a tragedy.
