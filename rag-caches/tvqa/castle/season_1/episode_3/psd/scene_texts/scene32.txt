Beckett : - Irritating, isn't it? - Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, look at you.
Martha : And look, everyone is buying your book.
UNK: Now, don't you feel silly for believing all those reviews?
Castle : Yes. Yes, I do.
UNK: Oh, let's just hope Nikki Heat does as well.
UNK: - "Nikki Heat"? - The character he's basing on you.
UNK: - "Nikki Heat"? - Uh-oh!
Beckett : - Can I talk to you for a second? - Of course.
UNK: I wanna hear.
UNK: - What kind of a name is "Nikki Heat"? - A cop name.
Beckett : - It's a stripper name. - Well, I told you she was kind of slutty.
Beckett : - Change it, Castle. - Well, hang on a second.
Beckett : - Change the name. - No.
Castle : - Yes. - No.
