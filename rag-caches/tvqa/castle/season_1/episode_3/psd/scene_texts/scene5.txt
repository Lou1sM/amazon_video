Beckett : Mr. Horn's body was found all the way downtown.
Beckett : Did he have any enemies?
Nesbit : Well, he was a politician.
Castle : What about his opponent?
Nesbit : It's hard to imagine Jason Bollinger doing something like this.
Nesbit : He is eight points up in the polls.
Beckett : Did Horn or the campaign receive any threats recently?
Nesbit : Just your usual crackpots, nothing special.
Nesbit : Unless you count hate mail from Calvin Creason.
Castle : Creason, the hotel and club owner?
UNK: Owns Axium and the Soho Majestic.
Castle : Even ran Club Tasty, back in the day. There was this one time...
Castle : Story for another time. What did Horn do?
Castle : Crack down on the ecstasy dealers?
UNK: Creason bought that old meatpacking warehouse
Nesbit : on the Lower East Side.
Nesbit : He wanted to turn it into his next hip hotspot.
UNK: 300 rooms, sake bar, nightclub.
UNK: Neighbors didn't want a bunch of drunken
Nesbit : B&T'ers running through the streets, so Horn killed it in committee.
Castle : Leaving Creason with millions of dollars of now-worthless real estate.
Nesbit : Creason had a beef with Horn. It doesn't mean he killed him.
Beckett : It doesn't mean he didn't. Excuse me.
UNK: You wanna know what I did when I found out that he was dead?
UNK: Calvin Creason : I ordered myself an ice-cold bottle of Cris
UNK: Calvin Creason : and toasted the sweetness of the universe, okay?
Beckett : That's pretty callous, Mr. Creason.
Creason : Listen, what do I care? What do I care?
Creason : This guy was such a putz, acting like another hotel going up,
UNK: that was gonna be the end of the world.
UNK: Do you have any idea what one of my properties does for the local economy?
Creason : This city should be paying me, not stopping me.
