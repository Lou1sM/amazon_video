Castle : Yes, I did, Tiffany. And I am so glad you called.
Castle : Just out of curiosity, what are you wearing right now?
UNK: Hey.
Lanie : Damn, girl. You scared me.
Beckett : Lanie, you're surrounded by corpses.
Lanie : Yeah, I don't expect the living after 7 : 00.
Beckett : Funny. Neither do I.
Lanie : I'm an ME. What's your excuse?
Beckett : - Oh, don't be mean. - You deserve it.
Lanie : Getting a drink with me after work
Lanie : instead of getting your freak on with writer-boy?
UNK: Yeah, well, he is annoying,
UNK: self-centered, egotistical and completely...
UNK: Fun?
Lanie : And take it from me, girlfriend, you need some fun.
Lanie : I mean, how bad can he be?
UNK: Beckett.
Castle : Guess who's got a date with a prostitute!
Tiffany : Richard? I'm Tiffany.
Castle : It's a pleasure to meet you, Tiffany. Please.
Tiffany : Wow. A gentleman.
Castle : - We're a dying breed. - Well, then it's lucky I found you.
Castle : Actually, it's lucky we found you.
Beckett : Detective Kate Beckett. We need to ask you some questions
Beckett : regarding your relationship with Councilman Jeff Horn.
UNK: Sorry.
Tiffany : He was one of my regulars, but I swear I had nothing to do with his death.
Beckett : How often did you see Councilman Horn?
Tiffany : Once, maybe twice a week. At first, he just wanted to talk.
Beckett : Right. He paid you just to talk.
Tiffany : Detective, most men come to me because they're lonely,
Tiffany : because the people in their lives don't listen anymore.
