UNK: Hey! Hey! Hey!

UNK: Yes.
Esposito : Wasn't quite finished back there, Mr. Nesbit.
Esposito : You have the right to remain silent.
UNK: Anything you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Beckett : After we found the weapon in Nesbit's office, he made a full confession.
Beckett : He got Horn to call her husband and get him down to the overpass,

Beckett : Horn had a sister upstate.

Castle : Sorry, sorry.
Castle : "She stood there in stunned disbelief

UNK: "He reached out for her, and she took his hand,
UNK: "squeezing it for the very last time.
UNK: "She felt her heart stop a beat, and in that moment,
UNK: "she knew he was gone.
UNK: "Darkness fell across the face of the city, and across her face, as well.
