Will : Look, even if it's true, I don't work organized crime cases.
Beckett : Oh, come on, Will. You and I both know how this works.
Beckett : You reach out to the agent in charge, he talks to the AUSA running the case,
Beckett : and then I get to talk to Jimmy Moran.
Will : And I do this for you why?
Beckett : All right, let me put this another way.
Beckett : The Spolanos know that Jimmy is cooperating with the government.
Beckett : We know that they want him dead because they murdered the surgeon
Beckett : you feds hired to change his face.
Beckett : You guys put that doctor in harm's way, so you're doing it for him, not for me.
Castle : This is it. Don't be nervous.
Alexis : Dad! No! No severed heads.
UNK: - That's... I... It's time-honored... - No!
Martha : Richard, really.
Alexis : Take it off. Come on.
UNK: Fine.
Castle : - Hi. - Hi.
Owen : - Wow. You look really nice. - Thanks. You, too.
Castle : - Baby, find the lens. - Dad.
Castle : I'm not here.
UNK: Oh. - Dad, Gram, this is Owen.
Martha : - Delighted. - Hi. Hi. Hi.
Castle : - Pleasure. - Oh, don't they look adorable?
Martha : And a corsage.
UNK: Here. It goes on your wrist.
UNK: Not bad. Oh, okay.
UNK: Oh, it's beautiful. It's beautiful.
UNK: - Ready? Yeah, okay. - Yeah.
UNK: What? Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait.
Castle : That's it? I don't even get a chance to ask him if he's killed a man?
Alexis : Dad, he hasn't. But I might.
UNK: All right. Get out of here. Don't do anything I would do.
UNK: Bye.
Martha : - Enjoy yourselves. - Have fun! Bye!
UNK: My little girl! She's all grown up.
Martha : Yeah. Well, at least one of you is. A severed head?
Castle : Ooh, I was just getting started, too.
Castle : I was gonna break into my Chris Walken.
UNK: "Whoa! Tell me, little man,
UNK: "have you ever been to prison?"
Martha : Very funny. Very funny. But leave the acting to me, honey.
Castle : Hi, Detective Beckett.
Beckett : - Castle? - It's my Chris Walken.
Alexis : - What do you think? - Uh, needs work.
Castle : In all fairness, part of it's visual.
UNK: Listen, Sorenson's on board. He pulled some strings
Beckett : and got someone at the US Attorney's Office to cave.
Castle : He's gonna let you question Moran?
Beckett : But we gotta be there in an hour. You in?
Castle : Am I in? Is the Pope Catholic? Lt'll grow on you.
UNK: Seriously? Parking garage? - What?
Beckett : Yeah, well, no one said that the feds were original.
Castle : Yeah. Next thing, you'll tell me they'll be pulling up
Castle : in a black Suburban with tinted windows.
Castle : Oh, someone's been watching way too many Bruckheimer films.
UNK: Ms. Robinson : Five minutes, Detective. That's all you get.
Beckett : NYPD thanks you for your cooperation.
Will : - Want me to watch the monkey? - That's okay. Monkey comes with me.
Will : Suit yourself.
Castle : Hey, I really like your car. It's very nondescript.
Beckett : Mr. Moran, I'm Detective Beckett. This is Richard Castle.
Beckett : Richard Castle, like the novelist?
Castle : Exactly like.
Moran : - I thought you guys were cops. - He's consulting on the case.
Moran : Look, I already told the feds everything I know.
Moran : You want info on the Spolanos, ask them.
Beckett : Actually, we're not here about the Spolanos.
Beckett : We're here about Dr. Leeds, the man who operated on you.
Moran : - What about him? - He was found murdered last week.
Moran : Murdered? The doc was murdered?
UNK: Asphyxiated. They duct-taped a plastic bag over his head.
Beckett : We believe the Spolanos may have been involved.
Moran : "May have been"? "May have been"?
Beckett : Given how Leeds was killed, and given your knowledge of the organization,
Beckett : we were hoping that you would be able to help identify the...
Moran : - Hey! Hey! - What's wrong?
Moran : Get me out of here!
Beckett : We can help, Mr. Moran. We can find the guys who did this.
Beckett : But you have to let me know if there was anyone
Beckett : in the Spolano family that kills this way.
