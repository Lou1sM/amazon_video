Moran : Yeah. Yeah, there is. Me.
Moran : The duct tape, the bag. That was my MO. Don't you get it?
Moran : They're sending a message to me. And if they got to the doc...
Moran : Take me back! Now!
Ryan : - Hey, how'd it go? - Oh, do the words
Beckett : - "unmitigated disaster" mean anything? - What happened?
Castle : We scared a key witness in a huge federal case
Castle : - so bad that now he won't testify. - Oh, is that all?
UNK: Beckett, I just got a call from DOJ.
UNK: - Sir, I can explain. It... - No, no. It's Sorenson.
Montgomery : On the way back to the FBI safe house with Moran,
UNK: someone pulled up next to them and opened fire.
Montgomery : He was in the back with the witness. They both were shot.
Ryan : Car was a late-model sedan with dealer plates.
UNK: The guy pulls up at the light with a mask on, blew the tires,
UNK: and starts shooting at the back of the vehicle.
Castle : I thought the glass would be bulletproof.
Esposito : They used cop killers. Teflon rounds. Went right through the door.
Beckett : He's still in surgery. Moran's gonna be okay, though.
Castle : - You want to talk? - There's nothing to talk about.
Beckett : I'm the one who pushed for it and I'm the one who got Will involved.
Castle : There's no way you could have known this was gonna happen.
Beckett : Are you sure about that?
Beckett : Because their vehicle was attacked leaving our meet.
Castle : - So? - So, we were followed.
Beckett : Someone who knew about the investigation found out about the meet.
Beckett : We led them to Moran. So, yeah, I should've known.
UNK: And if I were a better cop, I would have.
Castle : You think this is your fault?
Castle : Yeah, you pushed for it. Not because it's your job, but because you care.
Castle : Most people come up against a wall, they give up.
UNK: Candace Robinson : Not you.
Castle : You don't let go. You don't back down.
Castle : That's what makes you extraordinary.
Ryan : He's gonna make it. He's gonna be okay.
Owen : I... I had a good time.
Alexis : Me, too.
Owen : - Good night. - Night.
Castle : Did you have fun?
Alexis : As a matter of fact, I did. This dating thing is kind of nice.
Castle : How was Owen? Don't worry. I closed my eyes for the kissing part.
Alexis : Yeah. Me, too. You know, you didn't have to wait up.
UNK: It's my job. I wait up. I make sure you're all right.
Castle : But tonight, I realized I'm not gonna be doing it for much longer.
Alexis : - Dad... - In a couple of years,
Castle : you're gonna go off to college. You're gonna get married.
Castle : You're gonna have kids. And I'm only gonna see you on holidays.
UNK: Until some gold-digger steals all my money,
Castle : but then I get to move in with you.
Alexis : Wow. I feel like I just lost 30 years of my life.
Castle : That's how it happens. One day, you're in tutus,
Castle : and the next day, you're too old for severed heads.
Alexis : Dad, don't worry. No matter how old I get, I'll always be your little girl.
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : - Promise? - Promise.
Alexis : Thank you.
Alexis : - Now go to bed. - Okay.
UNK: Desk officer said she came in at 4 : 00 this morning.
UNK: She's been at the board ever since.
UNK: She called us in at 6 : 00 a. m. To recheck every person we talked to on the case.
Ryan : And she's had, like, nine double espressos.
