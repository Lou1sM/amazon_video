Beckett : I'm not running a background check on your daughter's date.
Castle : Oh, come on. She says he's quiet, he keeps to himself
Castle : and he lives with his parents.
Castle : Tell me that doesn't sound like a serial killer to you.
Esposito : Who's a serial killer?
Beckett : Castle's daughter, Alexis, got invited to prom.
Castle : It's her first real date.
Ryan : And you're worried he's a serial killer?
Ryan : You should be more worried he's a teenage boy.
UNK: Oh, he's only 15.
Ryan : Between satellite TV and the Internet, 15's the new 25.
Esposito : - Dude's right. I was 15 once. - You still are.
Esposito : If I had a daughter her age, I'd never let her out of the house.
Castle : - Thanks, guys. Mmm-hmm.
Ryan : Car was towed in a few hours ago.
Ryan : Parking violations. When the attendant went to look for the VIN number,
Ryan : he found the vic, slumped over with a bag on his head.
Castle : Six parking tickets and a tow sticker, and no one bothers to look inside?
Esposito : Tinted windows. Sunshade on the windshield.
Castle : You'd think someone would try to at least look inside.
Beckett : Yeah, welcome to New York. You got an ID?
Esposito : Yeah. Dr. Joshua Leeds, 37.
Esposito : According to the business cards in his wallet, he's a plastic surgeon.
UNK: - Car's also registered to him as well. - Any money in the wallet?
UNK: Yeah, couple of hundred bucks.
Beckett : Well, I guess we can rule out robbery.
Castle : Plastic bag and duct tape. Not a very efficient way to kill someone.
Beckett : No, but it's very personal. All right, find and notify next of kin.
Beckett : Let's see how long he's been missing.
Lanie : From the state of decay, I'd say about a week.
Ryan : That matches the date on the first parking ticket.
Lanie : Preliminary cause of death indicates asphyxiation,
Lanie : but I'll run toxicology, just in case.
Esposito : That bag's pretty thin. Why wouldn't he just rip it off?
