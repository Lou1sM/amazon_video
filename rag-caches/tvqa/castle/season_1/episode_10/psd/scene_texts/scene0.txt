UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : A stabbing, Rick? Isn't that a little pedestrian for you?
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : Usually, when you call me, it's to ask what happens
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : if you put a head in a microwave.
Castle : Well, this one's a little less made-up.
UNK: The victim is the mother of that detective I've been following around.
UNK: Ah.
UNK: The case has been cold 10 years.
Castle : I just figured, since you're the best forensic pathologist in the city,

UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : The odds of finding anyone's killer after 10 years...
Castle : Astronomical, I know. But I'd appreciate it if you took a look.
