Beckett : who had had complications or a bad experience?
Julia : None of his patients had complications.
Mario : That doesn't mean that they were always happy.
Mario : Cosmetic surgery is about self-image. For some people, it changes their lives.
Mario : For others, nothing's ever enough.
Beckett : Did any of his patients ever threaten him?
Julia : One. Jacey Goldberg.
Julia : She was a patient of Dr. Leeds until about three months ago.
Castle : - What happened? - She wanted a face-lift.
Castle : - So? - So, she already had three.
Mario : Dr. Leeds refused to perform the operation.
Castle : So, what'd she do?
Julia : She sued him. It was thrown out of court, of course.
Maggie : That's when the threats started.
Montgomery : At the very least, she should be arrested for violating the laws of nature.
Esposito : Check this out.
Esposito : Jacey Goldberg's husband, Jack, had her committed to Bellevue a month ago
Esposito : for psychiatric treatment for her little obsession.
Ryan : Guess who testified in support of her commitment.
Esposito : - Dr. Joshua Leeds. - Mmm-hmm.
UNK: Mandatory one-month treatment program. She was released last week.
Esposito : Three days before our doctor went missing.
Castle : Mentally unstable plastic surgery chick.
Castle : That is way better than harvesting organs.
Montgomery : Get her in here.
UNK: Wow. Look at her. How can anyone do that to themselves?
Beckett : Come on, guys. She's not an animal, she's a human being.
