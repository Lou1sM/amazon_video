UNK: You told me that certain mob hitmen have signature styles or weapons.
Sal : - That's right. - Okay. Well,
Castle : this killer used a plastic bag with duct tape to suffocate his victim.
Castle : Does that sound like anyone you know?
UNK: No. You'd have to ask the Spolanos about that one.
Castle : Yeah, I don't think they'd like that.
Sal : Probably not. I bet you I know somebody else who might know.
Castle : - Who? - Jimmy "the Rat. "
Sal : Jimmy "the Rat" Moran, aka Jimmy Pretty.
UNK: Been linked to gambling, loansharking and extortion schemes.
Ryan : You know, you want a guy to be loyal,
Ryan : you probably shouldn't nickname him "the Rat. "
UNK: Okay, so let's start off by digging up
Beckett : all known associates of the Spolano family.
Ryan : Yeah, sure. And while we're at it,
Ryan : we'll just bang our heads against a brick wall. You know, just for fun.
Esposito : Professional hits are the hardest to close.
Esposito : Because of the anonymous nature of the murders,
Esposito : the usual rules, like motive and relationship to victim, don't apply.
