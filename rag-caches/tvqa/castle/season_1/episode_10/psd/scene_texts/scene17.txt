Ryan : How about this kind of procedure?
Julia : This is impossible. I'm his primary nurse.
Julia : I run his surgical team. He never operates without me.
Esposito : Apparently, he did.
Julia : Mario, check on Dr. Leeds' calendar.
Julia : What do you have for March 18th?
Mario : He was supposed to be down at Mercy,
UNK: attending the panel on reconstructive surgery.
Julia : Why would he lie? Why would he operate without me?
Esposito : According to the hospital, the procedure lasted nine hours.
Esposito : Neither the assisting nor the anesthesiologist were with the hospital.
Esposito : Both were brought in by Dr. Leeds, neither of his regulars.
UNK: A nine-hour mystery operation he didn't want his own people to know about?
Beckett : The hospital must've had some record of the patient.
Ryan : Get this. The hospital can't find the file. It's like it never happened.
Castle : - Who did you talk to? - Patient Information.
Castle : Well, that was your first mistake.
Castle : You want to find someone at a hospital who had a treatment there,
Castle : there's only one department to go to
Castle : where nothing ever falls through the cracks.
UNK: Billing. Someone had to pay for it, right?
Beckett : Thank you. No. I appreciate it.
Beckett : Well, it looks like our mystery patient's hospital bills
Beckett : - were paid promptly and in full. - By whom?
Beckett : - Wire transfer. Esposito. - Yeah.
Beckett : See what you can find on this account number.
Beckett : - All right. - So, did Alexis find a dress yet?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah. Cute one, too.
Castle : Boy, I can't believe my little girl's going to prom.
