Castle : I'm investigating her mother's murder.
Martha : You are digging up her past, darling, without her permission.
Martha : Now, you either tell her or leave it alone.
Alexis : Oh, my gosh, Dad!
Alexis : - Dad, Dad, Dad! - What is it?
Alexis : - Dad, he asked me! Dad, he asked me! - Who asked you?
Alexis : Owen. But I told him I had to ask you, but you'll say yes, right?
Alexis : 'Cause I told him yes, but you have to say yes, so say yes.
Castle : - Yes? - Yes! Yes!
UNK: Yes!
Castle : What am I saying yes to?
Alexis : The Junior-Senior Prom.
Castle : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You are not a junior, nor a senior.
UNK: True, but Owen's a junior.
UNK: Owen? I thought you said he was only 15.
Castle : Yeah, he skipped a grade. But he's so cute, Dad. Please, please, please.
