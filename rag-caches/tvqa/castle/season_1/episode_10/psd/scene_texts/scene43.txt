Beckett : Thank you, sir. You know, sir,
Beckett : I never thought that I would be saying this, but
Beckett : I don't think I could have done it without Castle.
UNK: Where's Castle, anyway?
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : The original ME concluded that the stab wounds were random.
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : Now, maybe the killer got lucky. But you see this wound here?
Castle : - Yeah. - It's a low-angle thrust to the kidney.
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : The wound size indicated that the knife was twisted.
UNK: Her body would've gone into immediate shock.
Ryan : What about these?
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : Well, their angles indicate that they were delivered
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : after she was immobilized and on the ground.
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : They're just for show. This is the one that killed her.
