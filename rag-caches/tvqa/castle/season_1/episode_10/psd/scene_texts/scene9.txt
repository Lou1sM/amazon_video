Ryan : How'd he wind up dead on a street in Harlem?
Castle : Like, maybe he secretly made a living out of using his surgeon's skills
Castle : to harvest organs off of tourists for the black market organ trade.
Castle : Whoa, that was a good one. I'm writing that down.
Beckett : So, instead of making up stories, we are going to establish a timeline.
Beckett : - When did he get his first ticket? Last Wednesday morning.
Esposito : Okay. So, you guys go to the Midtown garage
Esposito : where he kept his car, and we'll hit his office.
Esposito : - Cool. - Okay.
Castle : Hey, can I ask you something?
Beckett : Since when do you ask permission to ask questions?
Castle : It's about your mother's case.
Castle : Have you ever thought about reopening it?
Beckett : What are you doing?
Castle : Nothing. I just thought if we worked together...
UNK: No.
Castle : I have resources.
Beckett : Castle, you touch my mom's case
Beckett : and you and I are done. Do you understand?
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Why don't you want to investigate it?
Beckett : Same reason a recovering alcoholic doesn't drink.
Beckett : You don't think I haven't been down there?
Beckett : You don't think I haven't memorized every line in that file?
