UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : Well, I'll do what I can. Just don't go making any promises I can't keep.
Castle : Course not. Thanks again.
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : - Get back to you as soon as I can. - I appreciate it.
Martha : - What was Dr. Death doing here? - Just a little consulting.
Martha : Sounded to me like you were looking into
Martha : Detective Beckett's mother's murder.
Castle : Must you always eavesdrop?
Martha : I wasn't eavesdropping. I happened to walk by your office door.
Martha : - I live here, too, you know. - Yes, I'm aware.
Martha : So, does she know you're poking into her mother's case?
UNK: What's the sense of telling her until I find something new?
Martha : Well, you ever stop to think you're invading her privacy?
Castle : I'm not poking through her underwear drawer.
