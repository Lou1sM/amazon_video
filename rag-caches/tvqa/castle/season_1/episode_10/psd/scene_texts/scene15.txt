Beckett : It'd be almost impossible
Beckett : for a run-of-the-mill revenge murderer to be that invisible.
UNK: - You thinking it was professional? - I don't know.
Beckett : Mrs. Goldberg had enough money to pay someone to do it.
Beckett : And her surgery is a pretty convenient alibi.
Beckett : But torture and suffocation? That doesn't seem like the work
Beckett : of a disgruntled trophy wife turning 50.
Montgomery : Surgeon with broken fingers? That's someone sending a message.
Alexis : - What do you think? - You look beautiful.
Alexis : Dad, you say that about every dress.
Alexis : Don't you think this makes my skin look pasty?
Castle : Sweetheart, I want you to know, no matter how you think you look,
Castle : you are perfect exactly the way you are.
Castle : - You're not helping. - Oh, God, no. Hideous.
Alexis : - Thank you. - Here.
Martha : Try this. All right. Good color for you.
Beckett : - What are you doing? - What?
Castle : "You look hideous"? Are you trying to give her body-image issues?
UNK: Oh, newsflash. She already has body-image issues.
Martha : It's an intrinsic part of being a woman.
Martha : Every woman in the world has some part of herself
Martha : that she absolutely hates.
Martha : Her hands are too small, her feet are too big,
Martha : her hair's too straight, too curly. Her ears stick out, her...
Martha : Oh, God, her butt's too flat, her nose is too big.
Martha : And you know, nothing you can say will change how we feel.
Martha : What men don't understand is,
Martha : the right clothes, the right shoes, the right makeup just...
Martha : It hides the flaws we think we have.
Martha : They make us look beautiful to ourselves.
Martha : That's what makes us look beautiful to others.
Castle : Used to be,
Castle : all she needed to feel beautiful was a pink tutu and a plastic tiara.
