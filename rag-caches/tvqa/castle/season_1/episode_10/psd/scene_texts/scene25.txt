Beckett : Oh, come on, Will. You and I both know how this works.
Beckett : You reach out to the agent in charge, he talks to the AUSA running the case,
Beckett : and then I get to talk to Jimmy Moran.
Will : And I do this for you why?
Beckett : All right, let me put this another way.
Beckett : The Spolanos know that Jimmy is cooperating with the government.
Beckett : We know that they want him dead because they murdered the surgeon
Beckett : you feds hired to change his face.
Beckett : You guys put that doctor in harm's way, so you're doing it for him, not for me.
