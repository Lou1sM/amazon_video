Castle : My only comfort now is the longstanding tradition
Castle : - of torturing the boyfriend. - What do you mean?
UNK: You know, the time-honored hazing that goes on in those few moments
Castle : we share, where he and I are alone,
Castle : just before my daughter descends the stairs.
Ryan : I remember the terror of meeting my date's old man.
UNK: What'd he do?
Ryan : Checked my wallet for condoms, showed me his gun collection.
Ryan : My hands were shaking so bad, I could barely put on the corsage.
Castle : What'd your dad do?
Beckett : I... I don't know. I was in my room.
Castle : How was your date when you finally came out?
Beckett : You know, actually, now that you mention it, he looked terrified.
Beckett : And this whole time, I thought he was scared of me.
Castle : Nope. And now it's my turn.
Ryan : What are you planning?
Castle : Something befitting the name of Castle.
Esposito : - Yo, you're never gonna believe this. - What'd you find?

Ryan : Why would the DOJ pay for a cosmetic procedure?
Beckett : There's only one reason. To change someone's identity.
Esposito : So, you think the guy was in Witness Protection?

UNK: Then we'd better find him first.
Castle : How do you find someone who's in Witness Protection?
Beckett : We ask the people who are protecting him.
UNK: Ask Hard Candy? Good luck.
Ryan : "Hard Candy"?
Esposito : Assistant US Attorney Candace Robinson. She makes mobsters cry.
UNK: Candace Robinson : I'm sorry, Detective, but you must know
UNK: Candace Robinson : that information on a protected witness is confidential.
UNK: Candace Robinson : Whether or not you have proof that we employed Dr. Leeds,
