Beckett : He's still in surgery. Moran's gonna be okay, though.
Castle : - You want to talk? - There's nothing to talk about.
Beckett : I'm the one who pushed for it and I'm the one who got Will involved.
Castle : There's no way you could have known this was gonna happen.
Beckett : Are you sure about that?
Beckett : Because their vehicle was attacked leaving our meet.
Castle : - So? - So, we were followed.
Beckett : Someone who knew about the investigation found out about the meet.
Beckett : We led them to Moran. So, yeah, I should've known.
