Martha : We spend our whole lives trying to feel that way again.
Alexis : - What do you think? - I think it's you.
Ryan : Staff just went through all the files. No other red flags.
Ryan : Any dark secrets in here?
UNK: Yeah. Doctor Leeds had a weakness. Energy bars.
Esposito : The guy's a boy scout. Hell, he didn't even have any porn on his computer.
Ryan : - That's weird. - I know.
Esposito : Know what he had in his locked desk drawer?
Ryan : A fifth of Scotch?
UNK: Checkbook. The guy locked up his checkbook.
Ryan : What about these folders?
Esposito : Wedding stuff. Tux deposits. Catering invoices.
Ryan : Maybe some angry couple killed him for their wedding venue. Hmm?
Esposito : It's as good a theory as any.
Ryan : Hey. These aren't all wedding files.
UNK: That's odd. All the patient information's blacked out.
Ryan : Maybe Dr. Leeds has a secret after all.
Julia : It's his handwriting, but I've never seen this file before.
Esposito : Can you identify that patient?
Julia : Not from his notes. Just that it was a male, 55 years old.
