UNK: Detective, you are asking me to expose
UNK: Ms. Robinson : a witness during an ongoing federal investigation,
UNK: Ms. Robinson : and I am telling you that is not going to happen.
Castle : So, what now?
Beckett : This witness of theirs is key.
Beckett : Without knowing who he is or who's after him,
Beckett : there's no way of getting to the next step.
UNK: There's another way we can figure out
Castle : - who that witness is. - Yeah? How?
Castle : Candace Robinson's office deals
Castle : almost exclusively with organized crime.
Castle : - So? - So, what if we ask the other side?
Beckett : You want to ask the mob who the witness is?
Castle : Clearly, they already know who he is, if they're trying to kill him.
UNK: Like you said, he's gotta be a significant witness in a pretty big case.
Beckett : So, what do we do? Hop in the car, drive down to the Bada Bing?
Castle : I know a guy. He owes me a favor.
Beckett : You "know a guy"? What is this, a Mamet play?
Castle : From the early days of Derrick Storm.
Castle : He's a capo with one of the families. He's actually pretty nice.
Beckett : For a criminal!
Castle : I'm just saying, maybe he knows something.
Castle : Maybe he can tell us something the feds won't.
Castle : I keep forgetting you read plays!
Castle : Whoa! Whoa, whoa! I'm a friend! I'm a friend!
UNK: Sal?
Sal : Take him out back. Kill him.
UNK: Sal! Whoa, whoa! Sal! No, let me go. Oh, jeez. Sal, it's me. It's me, buddy.
Sal : Vito! Vito, wait! Vito, wait! Hold on. I was just messing with him.
UNK: It's all right.
UNK: - Come here. - Not funny, Sal.
UNK: No, you're right. No. It wasn't funny. It was frigging hilarious!
UNK: Richard-frigging-Castle. Master of the macabre.
Sal : What brings you down off your cloud of money?
Alexis : Thank you.
UNK: The guy you're talking about? He worked for the Spolano family.
Sal : Jimmy "the Rat" Moran. He was an underboss.
