Castle : This is sounding less like a random killing, more like a targeted murder.
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : There's more. On a hunch, I checked the City ME files
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : to see if this was an isolated incident,
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : and found three other stabbings around that time
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : that the ME working the case dismissed as random.
Castle : Were they related?
UNK: Dr. Clark Murray : Are you sure you want to know?
Martha : You have to tell her, you know.
Castle : Do you know what this would do to her?
Martha : You have information that could lead to her mother's killer.
Martha : You can't keep that from her.
Castle : I know. But she said if I opened the file that we'd be through.
Martha : It doesn't matter. She has to know.
