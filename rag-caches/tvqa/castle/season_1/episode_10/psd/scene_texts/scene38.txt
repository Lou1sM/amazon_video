UNK: It's my job. I wait up. I make sure you're all right.
Castle : But tonight, I realized I'm not gonna be doing it for much longer.
Alexis : - Dad... - In a couple of years,
Castle : you're gonna go off to college. You're gonna get married.
Castle : You're gonna have kids. And I'm only gonna see you on holidays.
UNK: Until some gold-digger steals all my money,
Castle : but then I get to move in with you.
Alexis : Wow. I feel like I just lost 30 years of my life.
