Beckett : You didn't think it was illegal to store a dead body in a freezer?
Albert : You think I knew? When I opened it up, I nearly had a heart attack.
Beckett : You could have called the cops.
Albert : Yeah, that's good for business.
Albert : What if it's a mob hit? I mean, I got a family.

Castle : So you find her. Next logical step, dump her at a construction site?
Albert : I know a guy who works over there.
Albert : So when I find the body, I figure that's the place, right?
Beckett : Show us where you found her.
