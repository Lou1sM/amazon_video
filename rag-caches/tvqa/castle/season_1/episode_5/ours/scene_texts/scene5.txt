Beckett : Five years in there. Nobody deserves that.
Beckett : How'd they make payments for the unit? Check? Credit card?
Albert : Cash, every six months.
Albert : But like I said, they were three months overdue.
Beckett : Puts the last payment at two months after her husband was killed.
Castle : Hard to make payments when you're dead.
Beckett : That camera in your office, you got footage
Beckett : of the guy who made payments?
UNK: That was nine months ago. We keep maybe two weeks at a time.
Beckett : Looks like Sloan was right.
UNK: Sam Cavanagh didn't have anything to do with it.
Castle : Well, if not Sam, then who?
