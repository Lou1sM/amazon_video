Beckett : Doesn't want to be reminded of the crime.
UNK: All right, I'm gonna go check out the fence.
UNK: Get a close-up of her face. I want to run her through Missing Persons.
Castle : Oh, cool. Like on the Discovery Channel,
Castle : where you plug the photo into a facial-recognition database?
Beckett : Yeah. Just like that.
UNK: Yes!
Beckett : Welcome to the department's official facial-recognition database.
Castle : By hand? That's like life before TiVo.
UNK: Maybe you could download an app on that phone of yours. You could just...
Castle : There are a lot of missing people.
UNK: One way or another, we eventually find them.
UNK: Some end up dead, some turn up in a double-wide
UNK: with a stripper named Trixie outside Atlantic City.
Esposito : And some just don't turn up.
Castle : Dana Sullivan.
Esposito : Her and her boyfriend leave a club.
Esposito : He's a couple steps behind her 'cause he gets a call on his cell phone.
Esposito : She turns a corner just a few seconds before he does.
Esposito : And when he comes around, she's gone. Street's totally empty.
Esposito : No traffic, no nothing.
Esposito : In a matter of three feet, she literally just disappeared.
Castle : People don't disappear off the face of the earth.
UNK: One minute, you're getting a hot dog in the park,
UNK: the next you're fighting off Sleestaks on the far side of the dimensional rift.
Castle : I don't buy it. There's got to be an explanation.
UNK: A story that makes everything make sense.
Beckett : Okay, Castle. What's our Jane Doe's story?
Castle : Well, I don't know how it starts, but I know how it ends.
Castle : Frozen at a construction site.
Castle : So, flying monkeys aside, what's the first question?
Castle : How did she get there?
Ryan : Considering she was frozen solid, she had to have been kept pretty close.
Castle : Not necessarily.
UNK: Here is the site. Her body might not have been kept
UNK: as close as you might think.
