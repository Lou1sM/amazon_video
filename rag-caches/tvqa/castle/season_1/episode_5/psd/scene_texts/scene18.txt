Castle : The facts?
UNK: Fact, they had two small children.
Castle : - So? - Based on police statements,
UNK: they didn't have a babysitter.
UNK: With him at work,
UNK: she would have had to have been with the kids the day she disappeared.
Beckett : But Sam said that she left later that night.
Castle : Which the doorman was never able to corroborate.
Beckett : So, if she was there, and she never left, then...
Castle : Then she was murdered in the apartment.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Another fact, he lived in Manhattan.
Beckett : And, like most people in the city, he didn't own a car.
UNK: So what is a good husband to do, living in Manhattan,
UNK: with his wife's body?
UNK: He can't leave it in the apartment. He can't walk out the lobby with it.
UNK: So the only question is...
Beckett : How did he get the body to the storage unit?
UNK: He...
Castle : - He could... No. - No.
