Albert : What body? I don't know what you're talking about.
Beckett : A witness saw someone driving one of your yellow trucks
Beckett : and dumping the body.
Albert : You're lying. No one saw.
Castle : Ouch. Wow. Maybe you should have tried denying it first.
Beckett : Let me help you. Melanie Cavanagh, mother of two.
UNK: Wife of Sam Cavanagh.
Albert : Okay, look. I dumped her. But I swear, I...
Beckett : - You didn't kill her, right? - That's right. I found her.
Albert : I never even knew she was here.
Castle : What do you mean, "here"?
Albert : Sixth floor.
Albert : Renters were in arrears.
Albert : We usually give them three months, and then we cut the locks
Albert : and we sell the belongings.
Albert : Only this time, all I find is a freezer plugged into a light outlet,
Albert : which, by the way, is totally illegal.
Beckett : You didn't think it was illegal to store a dead body in a freezer?
Albert : You think I knew? When I opened it up, I nearly had a heart attack.
Beckett : You could have called the cops.
Albert : Yeah, that's good for business.
Albert : What if it's a mob hit? I mean, I got a family.
Beckett : So did she.
Castle : So you find her. Next logical step, dump her at a construction site?
Albert : I know a guy who works over there.
Albert : So when I find the body, I figure that's the place, right?
Beckett : Show us where you found her.
Beckett : Five years in there. Nobody deserves that.
Beckett : How'd they make payments for the unit? Check? Credit card?
Albert : Cash, every six months.
Albert : But like I said, they were three months overdue.
Beckett : Puts the last payment at two months after her husband was killed.
Castle : Hard to make payments when you're dead.
Beckett : That camera in your office, you got footage
Beckett : of the guy who made payments?
UNK: That was nine months ago. We keep maybe two weeks at a time.
Beckett : Looks like Sloan was right.
UNK: Sam Cavanagh didn't have anything to do with it.
