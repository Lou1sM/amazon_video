Beckett : What do you remember about the days leading up to her disappearance?
UNK: Ben Davidson : Well, we talked to her a couple days before.
UNK: Ben Davidson : My wife did, I mean.
UNK: Julie Davidson : Everything seemed fine.
Beckett : She didn't indicate in any way that she was leaving?
UNK: No.
Castle : We're aware your daughter had some issues.
UNK: That had nothing to do with what happened here.
Beckett : How do you know?
UNK: Ben Davidson : You know, now you sound like the cop who first had the case.
UNK: Ben Davidson : Convinced she'd run away, convinced she was still on drugs.
Beckett : But you didn't think that.
UNK: Melanie
UNK: Ben Davidson : wasn't the greatest of moms, but
UNK: Ben Davidson : she loved her kids.
UNK: Ben Davidson : - She would have never left them. - What about her husband, Sam?
UNK: Julie Davidson : He thought it was drugs, too.
