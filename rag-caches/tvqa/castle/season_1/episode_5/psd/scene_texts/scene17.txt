Beckett : How'd you do it, Sam?
UNK: Castle o.s. : Run, rebel.
UNK: Castle o.s. : But you'll never defeat the forces of Voltar.
UNK: Death to Voltar! Death to the Voltarians!
Castle : I sense fear in you.
Alexis : You sense nothing!
Martha : Has anyone seen my purse?
Castle : Mom, we are totally doing battle on the field of honor.
Martha : How old are you?
Castle : Old enough to afford top-of-the-line laser tag.
Castle : I'm dead! Mom!
Castle : Now Voltar will never rule the omniverse.
UNK: Well...
Castle : Someone order food?
Lanie : - No. - No.
Castle : Better check this out.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Hi.
UNK: Roger o.s. : - Who is it? - Detective Beckett.
Martha : Darling, are we entertaining?
Castle : - Dad! - Yeah?
Alexis : - Manners! - Right!
UNK: Castle cont'd : Come on in. Please. Right. Enter.
Beckett : - Welcome. - Thank you.
Alexis : - To our house. - You bet.
UNK: You...
Castle : You remember my mother, Martha, and Alexis, of course.
Castle : - Hi! - Yes. Hello.
Castle : Can I make you a drink?
Beckett : Wow. I feel like Alfred in the Batcave for the first time.
UNK: Batman fan. Figures.
UNK: Why?
Castle : Similar origin stories.
Castle : Loss of a loved one leads to a life of fighting crime.
Beckett : Yes, well, you are the multimillionaire crime fighter.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : That's where I outline my books.
Beckett : It's funny.
Beckett : Looks a lot like our murder board.
Castle : Yeah, except mine's fake.
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : Something wrong?
Beckett : I can't find it.
Castle : - Find what? - The answer.
Castle : It was Sam. Everything fits. It's a good ending.
Beckett : Yeah, but without proof, it's just a theory.
Beckett : And that family, those kids, they need more than just a theory.
Beckett : They need to know. I need to know.
Castle : Well, you have an ending.
Castle : You want the rest, you need to work backwards.
Castle : You need to finish the story.
Castle : You have an ending. You have your killer.
Castle : You just have to put it all together with the facts at hand.
