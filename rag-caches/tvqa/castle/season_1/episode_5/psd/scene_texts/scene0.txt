UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Male Officer : Would all workers please clear the construction site?
Esposito : Why can't they find bodies between 9 : 00 and 5 : 00?
Beckett : - Well, early bird gets the collar. - Yeah.
Esposito : He was here before I was.
Castle : Finally. You are here. You are gonna love this.
Ryan : Come on, show's over. Active crime scene.
Ryan : We appreciate your cooperation.
Castle : Awesome, right? My first cold case.
Castle : Come on, it's a little funny.
Lanie : Not so much funny as true. She's frozen solid.
Beckett : - What was the temperature last night? - Mid-40s.
Lanie : It wasn't exposure.
Esposito : Site's active. Boys tell me there's no way she was here last night.
Beckett : She's melting.
Castle : Maybe we should be looking for ruby slippers.
Beckett : Yeah, while you're at it, why don't you look for some flying monkeys?
Beckett : Maybe they left her here. So what do you got for me?
Lanie : There are pieces of plastic on her body from the garment bag.
Beckett : So she was inside the bag.
Lanie : Other than that, it's gonna take a while for her to thaw.
Lanie : I can tell you she hasn't been here long. Maybe a couple of hours.
Beckett : What about security?
Esposito : Chain link. A pair of bolt cutters took care of that.
Ryan : Looks like our guy was hoping she'd disappear into the concrete pour.
Esposito : A few more feet, and she would have.
Castle : It's kind of odd, taking the trouble to freeze a body and then dumping it.
Castle : We got two personality types working here.
Castle : A killer who freezes a body is a keeper. He wants a souvenir.
Castle : But a guy who dumps a body...
