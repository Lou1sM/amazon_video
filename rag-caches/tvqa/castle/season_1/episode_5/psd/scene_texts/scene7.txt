Castle : Sounds like they were pretty unhappy with the original investigation.
Beckett : Yeah, well, from where I stand, they had every reason to be.
Castle : The guy whose case it was, you know him?
Beckett : No. Detective Sloan was before my time.
Castle : He still around?
Beckett : Well, if you count being a sheriff in Jersey, then, yeah, he's still around.
UNK: Melanie Cavanagh.
UNK: Sheriff Sloan : So, she was finally found after all these years, huh?
Beckett : She wasn't found. Her body was.
UNK: Sheriff Sloan : Sorry to hear that.
