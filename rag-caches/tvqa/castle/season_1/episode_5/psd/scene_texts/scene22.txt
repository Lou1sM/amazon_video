Beckett : Yeah, it does.
Deloris : Yeah, 'cause I already told the other cop.
Beckett : Detective Sloan?
Deloris : I don't know his name, but I told him everything, same as you.
Castle : I don't get it. If Sloan had that woman's report,
Castle : why didn't he just follow up?
Beckett : He wasn't looking for the story. He'd already written it.
Castle : That's the same kind of truck we saw outside Charles Wyler's store.
Beckett : He must have a contract with them.
Castle : If you wanted some help with some heavy lifting, who would you call?
Beckett : Your best friend.
Beckett : We can trace the rental of the delivery truck to you, Mr. Wyler.
Beckett : If you want, I can bring the lady you delivered the freezer to
Beckett : in to identify you.
Wyler : Look, I had nothing to do with what happened to Melanie.
UNK: You lied about everything else. Why not about this?
Wyler : I never had any reason to hurt her.
Beckett : But Sam did, right?
Beckett : I mean, she kept going back to her ex-boyfriend.
Beckett : How much can a guy take?
UNK: He called me that night.
Wyler : He said he needed me to come over right away.
UNK: When I got there, the kids were asleep and Melanie was in the tub.
