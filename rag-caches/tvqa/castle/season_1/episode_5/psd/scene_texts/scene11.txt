Beckett : Mr. Wyler, the detective investigating Melanie's disappearance
Beckett : said that you told him that she went to an ex-boyfriend in Philadelphia.
Wyler : I only told him what Sam told me.
Beckett : Sam told you?
Wyler : It's where she went before the wedding, and a few times after.
Beckett : But you're not sure that's where she went.
UNK: It's the only thing that made sense.
UNK: Melanie was a good person, but Melanie was troubled.
UNK: Sometimes, when things got hard, she'd go out and score, you know.
UNK: Come home high, accuse Sam of ruining her life.
UNK: He'd given her everything.
Beckett : Do you remember the name of the boyfriend?
UNK: -- [17 : Kevin Henson.
UNK: If something happened to Melanie, he's the one who'd know what.
UNK: -- [17 : Kevin Henson, Melanie's ex-boyfriend.
Beckett : He's serving a year for meth in South Jersey.
Beckett : He went in just after the last payment was made on the storage unit.
Castle : He stops payments, storage guy finds her body.
UNK: Capt. Montgomery : Quite a coincidence.
Beckett : And he was also on the outside when her husband was whacked.
UNK: Capt. Montgomery : Sounds like he's worth a trip to South Jersey.
Henson : You ever been in love, Detective? Makes you do crazy things.
Beckett : Like kill someone?
Henson : Mel and I, when we were together, time just stopped.
Henson : But even the first day, her and me, we both knew it was never gonna work.
