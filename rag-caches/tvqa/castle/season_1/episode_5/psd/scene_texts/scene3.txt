Lanie : this woman's been missing for over five years.
Beckett : She had a troubled childhood,
UNK: drug problems in her teens and 20s.
Castle : I know.
Beckett : How do you know?
UNK: I read the case file. She kicked the habit.
UNK: Met and married Samuel Cavanagh. She worked in a restaurant.
UNK: He managed a bank. They have two kids.
Beckett : - When did you read the case file? - That...
Castle : - When you were in the little girls' room. - I was gone for like a minute.
Castle : Speed reader.
UNK: Something I picked up from my years stranded
Castle : in the New York Public Library.
UNK: Would you like the CliffsNotes or, in this case, the CastleNotes?
Beckett : Castle, how do you know you didn't miss something important?
Castle : Like, after Melanie disappeared,
Castle : her husband waited a day before he called the cops?
Beckett : A day? That doesn't make any sense.
UNK: Until you get to the third paragraph.
UNK: Before Melanie was married, she was what is now referred to
UNK: as a runaway bride.
Beckett : According to her husband, she ran away a whole two weeks
Beckett : before their wedding day.
Castle : And then she came back.
Castle : Three years happily ever after, she disappears again. Comes back.
Castle : Lather-rinse-repeat three times. No indication of where she went.
