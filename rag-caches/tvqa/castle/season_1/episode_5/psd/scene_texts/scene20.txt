Castle : Field trip?
Roger : They told me he was shot in a mugging.
Roger : And now you're telling me he was killed here, in my apartment?
Castle : Not him. His wife.
Roger : His wife? What kind of family was this?
UNK: All right. So, you and I are married.
Beckett : - We are not married. - Relax. It's just pretend.
UNK: - I don't wanna pretend. - Scared you'll like it?
Beckett : Okay. If we're married, I want a divorce.
Roger : Are you two like this all the time?
Castle : - Yes. - Yes. All right.
UNK: We're not married, but they were. Let's say the doorman's right.
UNK: Melanie gets home about 4 : 00.
Beckett : She'd have to make dinner for the kids.
