Castle : Why did it end?
Elizabeth : I realized I loved my husband.
UNK: Please. No one ends an affair
UNK: because they realize they're still in love.

UNK: Scared of taking it to the next level, scared of being found out,
UNK: scared of ruining their life.
UNK: So, tell us, Elizabeth, what were you scared of?
