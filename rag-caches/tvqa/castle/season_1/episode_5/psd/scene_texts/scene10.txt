Castle : Well, if not Sam, then who?
Alexis : You know, we have air conditioning.
Castle : I'm just trying to figure out
Castle : why someone would put a dead body in a freezer.
Alexis : Is this a Nikki Heat or Detective Beckett question?
UNK: Beckett.
Alexis : That's right. The Nikki Heat thing was about incinerating a body
Alexis : in a self-cleaning oven.
Castle : I mean, you put things in a freezer to keep them for later,
Castle : but once they're there, you rarely ever go back.
Alexis : If I was putting a body in a freezer, it'd be because I was trying to hide it.
Castle : Until you stop paying for the storage space.
Alexis : Did I stop, or did something stop me?
Castle : It's family moments like these I will never forget.
Alexis : With a good therapist, hopefully, I will.
