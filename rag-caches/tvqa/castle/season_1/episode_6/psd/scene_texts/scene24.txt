Beckett : Azi, the man that you intimidated into finding Jamal,
UNK: he's very eager to testify against you.
Castle : Apparently, he takes his religious beliefs very seriously.
UNK: Doesn't believe vodun should be used to kill people.
Oni : I didn't kill anyone.
Beckett : Then why were you looking for Jamal?
Beckett : Tell me something. What's in the purse?
Beckett : What are you smuggling, Mr. Oni?
Oni : I want a lawyer.
Beckett : Are you sure? Because if you get a lawyer,
Beckett : you'll be out of here in about an hour, and I won't let you leave town.
Beckett : And that's exactly what you want, isn't it?
Beckett : To leave town?
Beckett : You scare a lot of people, Mr. Oni, immigrants, illegals.
