Beckett : What's he doing in the US?
Oni : He traffics. Drugs, women, whatever will make him money.
Oni : It is him that killed Jamal and the woman.
UNK: Why?
Oni : If I tell you, you will protect me?
Beckett : Oni's a counterfeiter.
Castle : And he gets papers for illegals, passports, visas, whatever they need.
Castle : A real friend to the community.
Esposito : Oni also provided Baylor with documents for his traffickers.
UNK: Sewn inside the lining of his purses.
Esposito : Yeah, which he keeps in the back of the stall.
Ryan : Only he didn't count on Fashion Scoop Daily.
Montgomery : - The website? - Yeah.
Ryan : The article on Sarah Jessica Parker? Appears there was a run on the purses.
Esposito : - Yeah. Our first vic, Jamal? - Yeah.
Esposito : He sold bags out front. He didn't know about Oni's scam.
Esposito : When he ran out of bags, he sold the ones from the back.
UNK: Why didn't he just get Oni to forge more documents?
Castle : It takes time, and Baylor doesn't have time.
UNK: The papers are for Baylor's brother in Africa.
Beckett : The Nigerian officials are closing in on him for drug trafficking.
