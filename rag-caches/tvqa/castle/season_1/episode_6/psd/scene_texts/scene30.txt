Beckett : She's got a coffee from Java Loft.
UNK: So?
Beckett : So, we're looking for a yoga studio near a Java Loft,
Beckett : somewhere off Canal Street.
UNK: Gotta be a dozen possibilities. Baylor's got a head start.
Castle : Yes, but I've got an awesome service plan now.
Beckett : We're looking for Yoga Girl.
UNK: You guys see if anyone else bought that purse.
Castle : There are four Java Lofts within five blocks of Canal Street.
Beckett : And yoga studios?
UNK: Time stamp on the video was 3 : 22.
UNK: We're looking for a yoga studio nearby with a class that ended about 3 : 00.
Beckett : Maybe the woman was on her way to yoga class.
UNK: You ever try doing a half-moon pose cranked up on caffeine?
Castle : Completely throws off your chi.
Castle : Trust me, she bought her coffee after class.
UNK: A class finishing around 3 : 00 p. m.
Beckett : Would give her enough time to buy a coffee...
Castle : But not enough time to finish it before Canal Street. Got it.
Beckett : NYPD. Do you know this girl?
UNK: Diana Edwards. What's she done?
Beckett : What do you mean?
UNK: Yoga Receptionist : You're the second cop that's come in looking for her.
Beckett : Another cop was here?
UNK: Yoga Receptionist : Yeah. He just left a few minutes ago.
Beckett : Baylor. We need Diana's address right now.
Beckett : Diana Edwards! NYPD! Open up!
Castle : Can I kick it down?
Beckett : Sorry, kitten. NYPD!
UNK: Okay, okay. Take it easy.
Beckett : Detective Beckett, NYPD. Are you Diana Edwards?
