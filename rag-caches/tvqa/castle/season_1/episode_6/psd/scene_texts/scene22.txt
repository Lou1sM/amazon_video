UNK: Video Store Manager : I'm sorry, but I can't show you the recording.
Beckett : - You need a warrant? - Wouldn't help. Sold it.
Castle : Sold the camera in the window?
UNK: Video Store Manager : Some guy rolls in here yesterday, asked for that one specifically.
UNK: I told him we got others, ones with boxes.
UNK: Video Store Manager : But he wants the one in the window.
Beckett : - What does he look like? - Six foot, big, black, had an accent.
UNK: Is that him?
UNK: Video Store Manager : No. He owns the stall across the street.
Castle : - You know him? - We say hi.
UNK: But this guy, he seemed heavy.
UNK: Video Store Manager : Not in the physical sense. Just something about him, you know?
UNK: Video Store Manager : Like he'd seen things, bad things.
Beckett : What else?
UNK: Video Store Manger : He paid cash. Retail.
UNK: Video Store Manger : I mean, at my prices? He didn't even try to negotiate once.
Beckett : Would you be willing to work with a police sketch artist?
