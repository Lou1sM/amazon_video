Alexis : I love her. I do.
Castle : I know you do, and I'm glad you do.
Alexis : But, Dad, she drives me crazy.
Castle : Yeah. That's what moms do.
Alexis : But if she lives here...
Meredith : Richard? Richard? Alexis?
Castle : Your secret's safe with me.
Meredith : Hello, anyone home?
UNK: Hello?
Meredith : You will not believe what happened. I got a call from my agent.
UNK: I've been offered a huge role in a new indie film.
Alexis : Wow. Mom, that's awesome!
Meredith : It is. But here's the bad news, sweetie.
UNK: I'm gonna have to put my plans to move back to New York on hold.
UNK: Oh, how ever will we manage?
UNK: That's okay, Mom. It sounds like a huge opportunity.
Meredith : It is. It really is.
Meredith : Besides, it's not like Broadway's going anywhere.
UNK: I can always do theater when I'm too old for high-def.
UNK: Uh, so when do you need to be back in LA?
Meredith : Tomorrow. I need to get back to my hotel and pack,
Meredith : but I wanted to tell you the good news.
Meredith : There's so much fun stuff we didn't get to do,
Meredith : but I'll be back soon, I promise.
Alexis : I know. I love you, Mom. Thanks for taking me shopping.
