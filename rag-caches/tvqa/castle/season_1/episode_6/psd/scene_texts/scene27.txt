Beckett : If Baylor doesn't get him to the US soon, they'll execute him.
Castle : Oni says Baylor operates out of a warehouse downtown.
Montgomery : Listen, find this dirtball before he murders someone else, all right?
Beckett : - Where did the bag come from? - Oh! Sorry. It's mine.
Castle : I felt, given everything that's happened, I should be prepared.
UNK: I got this special-order.
UNK: And look...
Beckett : - Writer? - Uh-huh.
Castle : - Cool, huh? - No. Not cool.
Beckett : You don't need a vest.
Castle : If you shoot me, do I not bleed?
UNK: You're not gonna get shot, and you know why?
Beckett : Because you are going nowhere near the gunfire. You're staying here.
UNK: Yeah, we've seen how well that works.
Beckett : Stay here, Castle, and don't do anything.
Beckett : All right, this is our guy. Got him?
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Meredith : Let's go.
Castle : I'm gonna... I'm gonna just get that.
UNK: A perfect place. It's light, spacious and only 1.6 million.
UNK: The text said, "Alexis. " It said it was an emergency.
Meredith : Well, how else was I gonna get you to call me back?
Meredith : So, I called the realtor and here's the thing.
Meredith : I may need you to co-sign the loan.
Ca : Meredith, we're divorced. I'm not gonna co-sign a loan for you.
Meredith : It's for Alexis, too.
Meredith : I mean, it's only a one-bedroom,
Meredith : but you want her to be comfortable when she visits, right?
Castle : Look, can I call you back?
Castle : I'm right in the middle of capturing a very dangerous Nigerian drug lord.
