UNK: Yeah. Hey!
UNK: Is everything okay? - Fine.
UNK: We have a video surveillance of you
Beckett : purchasing a Chanel bag on Canal Street two days ago.
Diana : Wow, I know you guys are cracking down on the knockoffs, but I...
Castle : Where's the bag?
Diana : Over there.
Diana : Excuse me. Hey!
Diana : What are you doing that for?
Diana : - What's going on? - You are a very lucky lady.
Diana : I don't understand. Am I in trouble?
Castle : No. But from now on, always buy retail.
UNK: Detective Beckett. I need a unit at 91 st and Broadway at the apartment...
UNK: Whoa!
Beckett : Call 911!
UNK: Mukhta Baylor : Give me the passport!
Beckett : Put down your weapon now!
UNK: Mukhta Baylor : Give me the passport!
Beckett : Baylor, any minute now, this place is gonna be crawling with cops.
Beckett : Don't make things worse than they are.
Baylor : Give me what I want and I walk away.
UNK: I've written this scene about 100 times.
Castle : We give him what he wants, you know how it ends? Badly.
Castle : And by badly, I mean us dead.
Beckett : - Just stay down. - You stay down.
Beckett : I can't shoot him from down here.
UNK: Yeah, he can't shoot you, either.
Beckett : I can't see him.
Martha : He's moving.
Beckett : I've only got two rounds left.
Beckett : I need a clean shot. I got to get eyes on him somehow.
Beckett : What's with you and phones?
Baylor : I'm not playing games!
Beckett : I don't have an angle on him from down here.
Baylor : I will kill you both!
UNK: Okay. When we shoot, he shoots.
Castle : He'll be exposed.
Castle : I'll set the pick, you take him down.
Beckett : - Set the pick with what? - This.
Beckett : You're gonna get yourself shot.
Castle : Not if you make your shot count.
Beckett : - Castle! - Just be ready.
Baylor : This is your last warning. Now!
UNK: Huh.
Castle : I'd say this deserves a toast.
UNK: Huh.
