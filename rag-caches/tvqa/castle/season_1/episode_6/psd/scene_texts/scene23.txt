UNK: Video Store Manager : Wouldn't a real picture be better?
Beckett : You said that he took the camera and the recordings.
UNK: Video Store Manager : Lady, this is an electronics store.
UNK: Video Store Manager : I got cameras all over this place.
Esposito : Yeah. He does look like the kind of guy
Esposito : who'd paint a death symbol on your floor.
Castle : What I don't get is, why would he want the camera?
Ryan : 'Cause he had the same idea we did.
Castle : We wanted the camera 'cause we wanted to find him.
Be : But what was he looking for?
Esposito : And what was inside the purses?
Esposito : Esposito. Yeah.
Esposito : Really? When?
Esposito : No, no, no. Absolutely. Bring him in.
Esposito : TSA just pulled Charles Oni out of a security line at JFK off our sketch.
Ryan : - Good call, bro. - Thank you.
Castle : Where was he going?
Esposito : Nigeria, under the name Robert Burnett.
UNK: Charles Oni : I don't know what you're talking about. I was going home to visit my family.
UNK: Then why'd you only have a one-way ticket?
Oni : My mother is ill. I did not know when I'd be returning.
Castle : Must be nice, being able to see your mother.
UNK: It's something that Jamal Buonsi will never get a chance to do.
Beckett : We know that you were involved in both of these murders.
