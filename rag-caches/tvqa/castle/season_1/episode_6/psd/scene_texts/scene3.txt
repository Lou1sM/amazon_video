Beckett : Excuse me. Beckett.
Ryan : Yeah. It's Ryan.
Ryan : We got another one.
Ryan : Victim's name is Darcy Cho. Second-year lawyer at a firm downtown.
UNK: Detective Javier Esposito : Multiple stab wounds, just like the last one.
UNK: Neighbor found the door open and called the super.
Ryan : This is what they found.
UNK: - The staging is exactly the same. - Yeah.
Esposito : When they saw what they had, West Side boys gave us a call.
UNK: Looks like she put up a fight. Defensive wounds on her forearms.
UNK: Paraphernalia's the same as the other murder.
UNK: And I found another charm in her mouth.
Beckett : Anything back from CSU on the other scene?
Ryan : Candle's basic paraffin, found in any bodega.
UNK: Figure it's gonna be the same with this one.
Ryan : Cloth is common red flannel. Glass bowl, made in China.
Beckett : What about the blood? - Chicken blood.
Beckett : Maybe she used this purse to defend herself.
Castle : We know he hasn't found what he's looking for.
Esposito : How do you know?
Castle : The charm in her mouth. He still needs the spirits to guide him.
UNK: Chapter 10.
Beckett : Find out what you can about Darcy. See if she knew our first victim.
UNK: I want to know how these murders are connected.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Alexis Castle : Mr. Simmons, you wanted to see me?
UNK: Mr Simmons : Alexis, I'm afraid we have some bad news.
Alexis : What? No, is it my dad? Did he get shot?
Meredith : It's not your dad, sweetie.
Castle : - Mom? - It's your grandfather.
Meredith : He passed away this morning.
UNK: Grandfather.
Meredith : I know, it's a lot to take in.
Alexis : Mom, I have a calculus test today.
UNK: Mr Simmons : Given the circumstances,
UNK: Mr Simmons : I'm sure Mr. Brown will let you make it up.
