Beckett : What do you mean, you didn't get the plate?
Castle : There was a... It was coming...
UNK: What kind of a car was it?
Castle : It was big. It was an SUV, I think.
UNK: You think. What about the color?
UNK: Uh, black. Dark blue. Uh...
Castle : It's very hard being a witness.
Castle : I don't know how you guys ever get a conviction.
Castle : I'm usually really good with the detailed stuff.
UNK: I just... I got distracted.
Beckett : Yeah. You're rolling calls during a tac strike.
Esposito : Hmm. Interesting.
Castle : He was supposed to be inside the building.
UNK: What about the color of your shirt? What is that right now?
UNK: Is it black or blue? I couldn't quite tell. The sun was in my eyes.
Castle : - Weird. Really weird.
Esposito : It's the same red flannel.
UNK: Hey. Vodun guy's a yoga nut.
UNK: Well, just 'cause you're a cold-blooded killer
Castle : doesn't mean you don't take care of yourself.
UNK: Guys. The camera from the electronics store.
Castle : See? Not a complete bust.
Castle : There's Jamal.
Beckett : And Darcy Cho.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back.
UNK: - Okay. - More. More. Stop.
Ryan : Ah, looks like someone else besides Darcy bought a Chanel bag from Jamal.
Castle : And she's carrying a yoga mat.
UNK: That's why he bought the camera. Baylor's looking for her.
Beckett : He wants his passport, so he's hunting down everyone that bought that purse.
UNK: Eight million people in the city. He'll never find her.
UNK: He found Darcy Cho. He'll find her.
Beckett : Not if we find her first. Zoom in on her hand.
