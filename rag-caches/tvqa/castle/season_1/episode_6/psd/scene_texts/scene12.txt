Azi : I don't know this woman. I haven't killed anyone.
UNK: So, you're telling me that it's all just a coincidence
Beckett : that these things were found in your apartment, under your bed?
Azi : They weren't mine! They were for someone else!
UNK: Who?
Beckett : Do you want to go back to Nigeria?
Beckett : Because I can arrange that with a single phone call.
Azi : So can he.
UNK: Who?
Beckett : Jamal was your friend, wasn't he?
UNK: Yes.
Beckett : Then don't you want us to catch who killed him?
Beckett : Don't you want justice?
