Beckett : Maybe the woman was on her way to yoga class.
UNK: You ever try doing a half-moon pose cranked up on caffeine?
Castle : Completely throws off your chi.
Castle : Trust me, she bought her coffee after class.
UNK: A class finishing around 3 : 00 p. m.
Beckett : Would give her enough time to buy a coffee...
Castle : But not enough time to finish it before Canal Street. Got it.
Beckett : NYPD. Do you know this girl?
UNK: Diana Edwards. What's she done?
Beckett : What do you mean?
UNK: Yoga Receptionist : You're the second cop that's come in looking for her.
Beckett : Another cop was here?
UNK: Yoga Receptionist : Yeah. He just left a few minutes ago.
Beckett : Baylor. We need Diana's address right now.
