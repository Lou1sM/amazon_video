Beckett : - Castle! - Just be ready.
Baylor : This is your last warning. Now!
UNK: Huh.
Castle : I'd say this deserves a toast.
UNK: Huh.
Beckett : Baylor's gonna make it.
UNK: You okay, Castle?
Castle : My first gun battle.
Beckett : Your last gun battle.
UNK: Mmm.
Castle : Don't be so pessimistic. I think I handled myself pretty well.
Beckett : Yeah. Probably saved my life.
Castle : Probably? I definitely saved your life.
Castle : And you know what that means, don't you? It means you owe me.
Beckett : - Owe you what? - Whatever I want.
Castle : And you know exactly what I want, don't you?
Castle : You know what I really, really, want you to do.
Castle : Never, ever call me kitten.
Alexis : - Dad? - Yeah, sweetie?
UNK: Hypothetically, is it okay to love someone,
Alexis : but not want them around all the time?
Castle : You mean Mom?
Alexis : I love her. I do.
Castle : I know you do, and I'm glad you do.
Alexis : But, Dad, she drives me crazy.
Castle : Yeah. That's what moms do.
Alexis : But if she lives here...
Meredith : Richard? Richard? Alexis?
Castle : Your secret's safe with me.
Meredith : Hello, anyone home?
UNK: Hello?
Meredith : You will not believe what happened. I got a call from my agent.
UNK: I've been offered a huge role in a new indie film.
Alexis : Wow. Mom, that's awesome!
Meredith : It is. But here's the bad news, sweetie.
UNK: I'm gonna have to put my plans to move back to New York on hold.
UNK: Oh, how ever will we manage?
UNK: That's okay, Mom. It sounds like a huge opportunity.
Meredith : It is. It really is.
Meredith : Besides, it's not like Broadway's going anywhere.
UNK: I can always do theater when I'm too old for high-def.
UNK: Uh, so when do you need to be back in LA?
Meredith : Tomorrow. I need to get back to my hotel and pack,
Meredith : but I wanted to tell you the good news.
Meredith : There's so much fun stuff we didn't get to do,
Meredith : but I'll be back soon, I promise.
Alexis : I know. I love you, Mom. Thanks for taking me shopping.
Meredith : Oh, anytime.
Meredith : - Goodbye, Martha. - Meredith.
Castle : You know, I always hate to see you go.
UNK: Next time, top 10.
UNK: Top 10.
UNK: - Okay, Dad, spill. - What?
Alexis : - What did you do? - Nothing.
Castle : Oh, my business manager called with an excellent investment opportunity,
Castle : a small, artsy independent feature.
Martha : Oh, that's my boy!
Castle : She's perfect for the role. I'm doing them a favor, I think.
Castle : I hope you don't mind.
Alexis : Raising one parent's hard enough.
Alexis : I don't know what I'd do if I had to raise two.
Martha : There wasn't a little part for me in the artsy...
Castle : - No. No. - No. All right, no.
