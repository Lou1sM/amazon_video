Beckett : NYPD. We'd like to ask you some questions about Cynthia Dern.
Swanstrom : I'm not sure what I can tell you. I hadn't seen her in 20 years.
Castle : But you knew she was writing a book, right? You spoke to Lee Wax?
Swanstrom : I spoke with her. I told her to give Cynthia my regards.
Beckett : So, you weren't bearing any old grudges?
Swanstrom : Against Cynthia? What for?
Castle : For turning you in.
UNK: It was Cynthia who called the cops the night you were arrested.
Swanstrom : Well, if that's true, she was just trying to save herself.
Swanstrom : Right after the bombing, Cynthia wanted to run.
UNK: You know, try to make it to Canada. But I fell apart.
Martha : - Why? - Guilt.
Swanstrom : I'm the one who built the bomb. I'm the one who messed it up.
UNK: Messed it up, how?
Swanstrom : The girls were supposed to have three minutes
Swanstrom : to get off that ship before it went off. Three minutes.
