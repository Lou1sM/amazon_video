Mayor : Then maybe it was Susan that wanted to save Pike,
Mayor : and Cynthia that wanted to run. Raise 20.
Castle : Right. But the bomb was already set,
Castle : so the three-minute timer is already ticking.
UNK: Judge Markway : The girls argue, wasting precious seconds.
Mayor : Susan runs towards the ticking bomb to try to shut it down...
UNK: Captain Montgomery : While Cynthia runs for cover.
Castle : Right. Susan gets to the bomb, but too late.
UNK: Boom.
Castle : Which means Susan Mailer didn't die trying to set the bomb.
UNK: Judge Markway : She died trying to save an innocent man's life. Fold.
Beckett : It still doesn't explain where the money came from.
Mayor : Fold. Well, what about it, Castle? You're good with twists.
Mayor : - Where'd the money come from? - I'm thinking.
Beckett : Yeah, well, you might want to think up some chips for the pot,
Beckett : 'cause it looks like it's just you and me.
UNK: All right, Detective Beckett. I'm all in.
Castle : Oh, what's the matter? You afraid of a little action?
UNK: Judge Markway : Oh, do us a favor, Detective. Beat his pants off.
Castle : Yes, please. Beat my pants off, if you dare.
UNK: Captain Montgomery : Beckett, do me proud.
UNK: To hell with "proud. " Make him cry like a little girl.
Esposito : All right.
Beckett : Sorry, fellas. It's just not my night.
UNK: Who's a good little boy? Who's a good little boy?
UNK: You are, and you are, and you are!
UNK: Judge Markway : Don't you ever get tired of winning, Castle?
Castle : Yeah, you'd think so, right? But, no.
Mayor : Well, I think that's it for me. Detective, it was a pleasure.
