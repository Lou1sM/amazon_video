Castle : This just wasn't my night.
Martha : See? I told you he was bluffing. It's the...
Esposito : It's that blinking thing. Yeah, you're right.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Yeah, we'll be there in 20. Homicide on Henry Street.
Martha : - I'll take care of this for you. - Thank you.
Montgomery : Well, at least you guys are already downtown.
Martha : But it's after midnight!
UNK: Murder never sleeps, Mrs. R.
Esposito : Yeah, and neither do we.
Castle : Whoa, whoa. Someone say "murder"? Hold on! I'll get my coat.
Esposito : Look at him, all excited.
Beckett : Yeah, like a kid at Christmas.
Ryan : With a dead body under the tree.
Beckett : Is that motor oil?
Lanie : Looks like it. But I'll have to pump out the tub and run some tests to be sure.
UNK: It's motor oil, all right. 10W-40. Empties in the closet.
Ryan : What kind of freak drowns a woman in motor oil?
Castle : Someone's trying to send a message.
UNK: Night Clerk : I already told the uniforms. Once the people check in,
UNK: Night Clerk : I don't want to know what they do up there.
Beckett : Her purse was missing, and she didn't have an ID on her.
Beckett : Any chance she paid for the room with a credit card?
UNK: All I can tell you is, whoever rented the room
UNK: on Friday paid cash for a five-day stay.
UNK: They were supposed to be out tonight,
UNK: so at midnight, I went up to check
UNK: if the place was empty, and found her in the tub.
UNK: Gonna be a bitch to clean it.
Castle : So, if anybody was meeting her here...
UNK: Night Clerk : It's not like the guests arrive and I ring them up. This ain't the Ritz.
Castle : - Clearly. What about tonight?
Beckett : Anyone strange coming in or going out?
UNK: Tranny Hooker : - Hey, Bill. - Jasmine. How's it hanging?
