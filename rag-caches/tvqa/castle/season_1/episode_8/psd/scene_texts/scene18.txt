Adam : But then someone got off the elevator and knocked on her door instead.
Beckett : - You saw her killer? - I didn't get a good look.
UNK: But I did hear them talking, and I can tell you one thing.
UNK: What?
Adam : It was a woman.
UNK: Castle cont'd : Lee Wax. Beckett!
UNK: Castle cont'd : It was Lee Wax! Beckett!
Esposito : Lee Wax.
UNK: Lee...
Lee : Murder? Are you people crazy?
Beckett : I have an eyewitness who can place you
Beckett : at the SRO where Cynthia's body was found.
Castle : You had motive, means, and opportunity.
UNK: Please. Only a novelist could come up with a twist this absurd.
Castle : Not as absurd as killing a woman to salvage your story.
Castle : Drowning her in motor oil gave you just the ending you needed.
UNK: I'm a true crime writer, so I don't have your talent for fiction.
Beckett : We know your publisher wanted to dump your contract.
Lee : Because I told them that I thought Cynthia was lying.
Beckett : So, you didn't believe her remorse was genuine?
Lee : When Cynthia cried, it was for herself.
Lee : She wanted to cash in and keep herself out of jail. That's it.
Beckett : Well, she must have felt some responsibility for what happened.
Beckett : After all, she sent the Pikes money year after year.
Castle : What money?
Adam : Every month since the bombing, the Pikes have been receiving money,
Castle : courtesy of Cynthia Dern. Only, there's nothing about that in your notes.
Lee : Because she never told me. Are you sure?
Beckett : We're sure.
Lee : Look, the Tuesday that Cynthia was killed,
Lee : I was out to dinner with my publisher until after midnight.
Lee : So, I couldn't have killed her.
