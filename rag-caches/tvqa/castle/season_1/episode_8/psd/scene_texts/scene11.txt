Beckett : Stay here.
UNK: Woman's Voice o.s. : - Hey, who the hell are you? - Who the hell are you?
Esposito : Lee Wax! What are you doing in my apartment?
Castle : You're a woman.
Lee : You... Either you tell me who you are right now, or I am calling the cops.
Beckett : I am the cops. My name is Detective Kate Beckett.
Beckett : We would like to ask you some questions about Allison Goldman.
UNK: Allison?
UNK: Oh.
Lee : Just... Just let me get my lawyer.
Beckett : - Why do you need a lawyer? - Why do you think?
Castle : So, you're confessing.
Lee : No, I'm not confessing to anything. It's just,

Lee : to law enforcement until I had a lawyer present.
Beckett : Your publisher?
Lee : You know, I would like to state for the record
Lee : that I never harbored, nor did I conceal, a fugitive.

Lee : Allison Goldman. If that's why you're here, then obviously you found her.
Beckett : Yes. Murdered.
Lee : Murdered? Murdered by who?

Lee : Wait, so you don't know who she really is?
Castle : We do now.
Castle : Apparently, our Westchester housewife was also a fugitive.
Montgomery : That's Allison Goldman?
Beckett : A.K.A. Cynthia Dern.
Beckett : In 1989, she and two friends set off a bomb
Beckett : on a tanker owned by a big oil company.
Montgomery : I remember this.
Beckett : Yes. One was killed, one was caught, but Cynthia Dern was never found.
Montgomery : It looks like her past finally caught up with her.
Lee : Jared Swanstrom built the bomb.
Lee : Susan Mailer and Cynthia snuck on board to set it,
Lee : only something went wrong.
Lee : You see, the ship was supposed to be empty of oil and people,
