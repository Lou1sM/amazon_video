UNK: - And, "Boom. " - Huh.
Alexis : But today, Jared Swanstrom said that Cynthia told him
Alexis : there was something wrong with the timer.
Alexis : She never said anything about an argument.
Martha : Oh. Well, that is a rather glaring omission.
Castle : You know, when I'm writing, I find it's all about choices.
Castle : What to put in, what to leave out.
Castle : When to reveal some information, when to hold something back.
Castle : But, as someone else's ghostwriter,
Castle : you only know what they want you to know.
Alexis : But Lee Wax isn't Cynthia's ghostwriter anymore, right?
Alexis : Now that she's dead, it's no longer a memoir.
Alexis : It's a true crime story. And it sounds like the true story
Alexis : is a whole lot juicier than Cynthia's lies.
Beckett : Good morning.
UNK: Oh! Hey. Sorry. I've just been going over Lee Wax's interview notes.
UNK: When she spoke to Jared Swanstrom, he told her the same thing he told us.
UNK: Cynthia said the bomb blew early. But she left that version out of her book.
UNK: That's because it contradicted Cynthia's latest story,
UNK: that the girls argued when they discovered
UNK: that Captain Pike was still on board, and that Susan set the bomb alone.
Castle : According to the publisher, Cynthia has full approval over everything
Castle : Lee Wax wrote. It was her way or the highway.
Beckett : You talked to the publisher?
