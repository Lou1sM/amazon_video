Martha : It's not even midnight.
Castle : Some people have jobs to go to in the morning.
UNK: Oh, my son, the working stiff. All right.
UNK: Martha cont'd : Phooey. I fold.
Esposito : If you don't mind me saying, Mrs. R., you fold a lot.
Martha : I just don't believe in stringing along a bad hand. Why waste time?
Castle : Actually, Mother's game isn't really Texas Hold 'Em.
Castle : It's strip poker. Keeps things humming along, if you know what I mean.
Martha : Well, frankly, I prefer strip because even when you lose, you win.
UNK: - Raise 20. - Call.
UNK: - Make it 100. - Whoa!
Esposito : - A hundred bucks? - Man up, bro.
Esposito : - Really? I'm out. - This slop.
Beckett : What about you, Castle? You're already in for the blind.
Beckett : Not scared of a little action, are you?
Castle : "Action" is my middle name.
Martha : Don't worry, sweetheart, he's bluffing.
Martha : Whenever he blinks too much, it means he's got a lousy hand.
Castle : - Mother. - Well...
UNK: All right, here we go.
Esposito : There it is.
UNK: Uh-oh.
Castle : - What? - He's not blinking,
Martha : but now he's tapping, which means he might have the nuts.
Castle : What's the matter? You're not afraid of a little action, are you?
Beckett : - All in. Whoa!
Montgomery : Ooh! Take him down, Beckett.
Esposito : Yeah, make him pay.
Ryan : Can't write your way out of this one, huh, Castle?
Esposito : Way to go, Beckett! - Maybe someone should change
UNK: their middle name to "Loser. "
Beckett : - Loser. What can I say?
