UNK: Castle cont'd : Just kidding. Actually, who needs a happy ending,
UNK: Castle cont'd : when you have a story with people pretending to be dead,
UNK: Castle cont'd : living under assumed names, plotting fake suicides, and murder for revenge?
Beckett : You know, I'm glad to see that you're entertained.
Beckett : I, however, have to call Michael Goldman
Beckett : and let him know that his wife was a sociopath.
Castle : But, you also get to call Jared Swanstrom
Castle : and tell him that he's no longer responsible for Susan Mailer's death.
Castle : Matter of fact, Susan Mailer's still alive.
Beckett : Which is why Cynthia's now dead.
Castle : Wow. You are all about the cloud, aren't you? Never the silver lining.
