Castle : and he's covering his tracks by calling the police
Castle : before the body is discovered.
Beckett : How about we question him before we convict him?
UNK: - You got an address? Thanks. - Okay.
UNK: I don't understand. Where did you say that she was found?
Beckett : At an SRO in the city.
UNK: It's a single-room occupancy. It's like a transient hotel.
Michael : Why would she be in a place like that?
Castle : Can you think of anyone she might have been meeting?
Michael : No. My wife and I were happily married, Detective. We had no secrets.
Beckett : You told police last night that your wife went into the city for her job?
Michael : She was working part-time.
Michael : We'd had some financial setbacks the last few years. I'd been laid off.
Michael : Then we had to give up the apartment.
Castle : How did your wife handle the move to the suburbs?
Michael : Not... Not too well. Allison missed the city.
UNK: So, a couple of months ago, she got a job,
Michael : working three days a week at a clothing boutique in Manhattan.
