UNK: No answer in the apartment when the doorman called upstairs.
UNK: But he's sure Chloe's there. He says Ian Harris is up there, too.
Ryan : Came home about an hour ago.
UNK: Which means Chloe would've been there waiting for him.
Beckett : All right, we don't have time to wait for emergency services.
UNK: - We're gonna have to go in on our own. - Whoa. What about him?
Beckett : - He stays here. - No! Come on! Come on!
Castle : I already signed my life away. What more do you want?
UNK: Okay, Castle, but it's accompany and observe,
Beckett : not participate and annoy. Got it?
Beckett : Participate and annoy is a lot more fun, but all right.
UNK: And stay behind us in the hallway, and don't move unless I tell you.
Castle : Hope to die. You know what I mean. It's...
Beckett : Open door.
UNK: I got a victim down, guys. Stack them up.
Beckett : - Police! New York City Police! We're here! We're here!
Beckett : - Mrs. Harris? - In here! I locked us in the bathroom.
UNK: - Room all clear! - Check him!
UNK: Mrs. Harris, are you okay? Is your daughter with you?
UNK: Yes. Yes, we're okay. He's still alive.
Beckett : Mrs. Harris, is Chloe there?
UNK: Mrs Harris : No, no, it's just me and Becca.
Esposito : Apartment's all clear. Chloe's not here.
Beckett : You can come out now, Mrs. Harris.
Beckett : - Where's Chloe, Mrs. Harris? - I don't know.
UNK: She must've used her key. I was just giving Becca a bath.
UNK: Mrs Harris : I didn't even know she was here.
UNK: Mrs Harris : - That's the doorman from downstairs. - Answer it.
UNK: Hello.
Castle : Thank you. I'll tell her.
Castle : Doorman says a tenant called.
Castle : There's a girl in the laundry room, and she's got a knife.
Esposito : Where's the girl? - She's inside, just sitting there.
Beckett : Esposito, get these people out of here.
Esposito : Let's go. Everybody up the stairs.
Esposito : Come on, let's go.
Castle : - So what's the plan? - To get everyone out of this alive.
Castle : Good plan.
Beckett : You don't go in. Do you understand?
UNK: Mrs Petersen : - Yes. - Okay.
UNK: Chloe? Chloe, it's Detective Beckett. Do you remember me?
Chloe : Please just go away.
Beckett : I'm sorry, Chloe, but I can't do that.
Beckett : Look, Chloe, you're hurt.
Beckett : Why don't you put the knife away, and let me help you?
Chloe : Why don't you just shoot me?
Beckett : Hey, look at me. Look.
UNK: No one's gonna shoot anyone. Okay?
Beckett : Unless it's you, if you take another step inside, Castle.
Chloe : He was sleeping with Sara.
Beckett : I know.
Chloe : Only the whole time, he was sleeping with me.
