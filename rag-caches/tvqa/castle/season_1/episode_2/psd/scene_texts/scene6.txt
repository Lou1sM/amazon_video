Martha : because research don't pay the bills.
Martha : - Is that the nanny? - Mmm-hmm.
Martha : What married woman in her right mind
Martha : invites a girl that pretty into her own home?
UNK: Mr Petersen : - Hey. - Hey.
Alexis : - What are you guys watching? - I'm watching. She's butting in.
UNK: The police can't find the nanny's cell phone.
Castle : They were hoping to lift some fingerprints from it.
UNK: I just thought I could see if she had it with her when
Castle : - she went down to the laundry room. - And?
Castle : It's in her hand the first time she brings the clothes down
Espositio : to the wash, but then she doesn't have it
Castle : - when she goes down to use the dryer. - So, she probably left it
Alexis : upstairs in the apartment where she worked.
Castle : They say they can't find it. Wait a sec.
UNK: What?
UNK: There's a five second time difference.
UNK: A five second time difference in what?
Castle : She rides the elevator twice to the basement.
Castle : The first time to put the clothes in the washer,
Castle : the second time to put them in the dryer.
Castle : Only the second time, the trip takes her five seconds longer.
Alexis : Why would it take her longer to travel the same distance?
