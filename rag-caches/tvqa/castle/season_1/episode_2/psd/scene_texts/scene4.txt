Beckett : I know what it feels like to lose somebody, Chloe.
Beckett : But we need to ask you these questions.
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Um...
Chloe : Sometimes we'd meet up before work, get a coffee on Columbus
UNK: and then walk over to work together.
Beckett : - Did you get coffee that day? - Yeah.
Castle : Did she say anything to you? Did she seem upset?
UNK: Detective Kate Beckett : - Or... - Upset? Upset about what?
Beckett : Brent gave us the impression that Sara was seeing someone else.
Castle : You know who it was, don't you?
UNK: Um...
UNK: Sometimes Sara would stay late.
Beckett : Stay late where, at the Petersons?
