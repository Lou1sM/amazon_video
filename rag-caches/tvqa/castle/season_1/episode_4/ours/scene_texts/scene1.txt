Castle : finer educational institutions at least once.
Castle : The irony is, now that I'm rich and famous,
UNK: they all claim me as alum and want money.
Beckett : It is just so rough being you.
Castle : My cross to bear.
Headmaster : When the Kendalls said they couldn't afford tuition,
Headmaster : we put Donny on scholarship.
Headmaster : The family had been very generous in the past,
Headmaster : and Donny was one of our brightest. We thought he'd do great things.
Castle : Any idea what he would have been doing at Central Park at night?
Headmaster : The truth is, all these kids are icebergs. We only see the tip.
Headmaster : If you want to know the rest, you should probably talk to his friends.
Headmaster : Amanda, Romy, Brandon, Spencer and Max.
Headmaster : It's strange seeing them without Donny.
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Thanks.
