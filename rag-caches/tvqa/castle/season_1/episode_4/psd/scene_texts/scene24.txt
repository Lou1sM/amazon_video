Spencer : You better hope that Brandon corroborates that.
Brandon : Look, I know Romy and Spencer told you guys everything
UNK: and that we're all in big trouble.
Brandon : - But I'm glad. - You're glad.
UNK: Yes. We should have just come clean with you guys after the accident.
Beckett : - You're damn right you should have. - I know.
UNK: But we didn't wanna screw Max over.
Castle : That's why you fingered the drug dealer, right?
Castle : - 'Cause he's expendable. - I told Romy that was wrong,
UNK: but she wanted to protect Max.
UNK: And that junkie's the one who got Donny into dealing in the first place.
Beckett : So where were you when Max was killed?
Brandon : With Spencer, at his dad's club. Ask him. He'll confirm it.
Beckett : You guys always have your stories straight, don't you?
UNK: "We weren't at the park. " "It was the drug dealer. " "It was Max. "
Beckett : You guys are always in sync. Maybe that's why I don't believe you.
