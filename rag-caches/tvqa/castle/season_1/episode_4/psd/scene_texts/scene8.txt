Amanda : - Yeah. We were there. - You were at the park?
Romy : Donny was out of control. We were just trying to stop him.
Castle : Why don't I believe you?
Brandon : Guys, just tell the truth.
Brandon : Sometimes we'd go to the park, too.
Spencer : We'd tell our parents we're hanging out at one of our apartments,
Spencer : but we'd actually go to the park and party. And Donny would...
UNK: Would get you whatever you wanted.
Beckett : So what happened?
Brandon : We're all just hanging out, having a good time, partying.
Brandon : And this guy came over, and he's all messed up, and he's got this gun.
Brandon : And he's yelling at Donny, "Where's my money?
UNK: "I need my freaking money!" Donny owes him $200.
Max : - And Donny didn't have it. - Then the guy points the gun.
Romy : And there's this loud pop, and you just see Donny's body crumple.
Beckett : - What did you guys do? - We ran. We just ran.
Beckett : - You didn't think to call the police? He was dead.
Spencer : I mean, we knew he was dead. Calling someone...
Beckett : Would have just gotten you into trouble.
UNK: Did you get a good look at this guy? Do you think you'd be able to identify him?
Spencer : It was dark, you know? Donny was at the end of the bench.
UNK: Who was the closest?
UNK: Okay, Romy, this will be easy. When we raise the shades,
Beckett : - they won't be able to see you. Are you sure?
