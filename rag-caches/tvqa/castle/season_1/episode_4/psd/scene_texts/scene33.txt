UNK: You told us that all your phones auto-share media files
UNK: - via a Bluetooth link, right? - So?
Castle : So your phone linked with Max's phone the night he was killed.
Beckett : It's a digital fingerprint that places you within 20 feet of Max
Beckett : at the time of his murder.
Castle : You did say if she got some actual evidence, she should arrest you.
Beckett : You took advantage of Max's guilt over Donny's death,
UNK: and you got him blackout drunk. And then you put a gun in his hand,
Beckett : pressed it against his temple, and then you pulled the trigger.
Brandon : Why would I do that?
Beckett : To cover your tracks over killing Donny.
Brandon : - Why would I kill Donny? - Amanda.
Brandon : Amanda is with me, not Donny.
UNK: Yeah, only after Donny lost all his money.
Beckett : Which makes you sloppy seconds.
UNK: That had to eat you alive, knowing that Amanda had been with Donny.
UNK: Especially 'cause he got way more than just under her blouse, right?
Brandon : I have that video that shows that Max killed Donny, not me.
Castle : And arranging that was very impressive.
