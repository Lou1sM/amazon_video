Alexis : - You should come next time. - Drug assemblies?
Castle : Is that what the kids are calling them nowadays?
Alexis : They serve cookies.
Castle : And which of your friends are going on this D.C. Jamboree with you?
Alexis : Taylor, Kelsey and Paige.
UNK: Okay. How do I know they're not bringing the blow,
UNK: and partying Winehouse-style?
UNK: Um, because you know them really well and they're good kids.
Castle : But maybe they're icebergs.
Alexis : Does this have something to do with that Redding kid?
Alexis : Dad, he was in Central Park really, really late at night.
Alexis : That's something I would never do.
Castle : But if you did, you could tell me.
UNK: I don't want you to feel you ever have to lie to me.
