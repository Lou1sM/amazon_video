Scoville : Don't trust her.
Castle : Seeing as how you're facing a murder charge,
Castle : why don't you just go with the flow?
UNK: Consultant-boy's right. You got nothing to lose.
Beckett : The night that Donny was killed, you sold to him and his friends, right?
UNK: Richard Castle : - No. - No?
Yenkman : That's not how you really get her to reconsider.
UNK: I didn't sell to them.
Scoville : - They was working for me. - Working for you?
Scoville : I supplied that punk. All right? His friends bought off me, too.
Scoville : Then they'd go play dealer, selling to the upscales in Sheep's Meadow.
Beckett : - Wait a minute. They sold for you? - Donny, yeah.
UNK: The others, it was just, like, a goof.
UNK: Like, walk on the wild side. Like, truth or dare.
Beckett : So where were you when Donny got shot?
Scoville : I was hanging with my boys, down by the Alice in Wonderland statue.
Scoville : We didn't see nothing. We heard the shot, took off.
