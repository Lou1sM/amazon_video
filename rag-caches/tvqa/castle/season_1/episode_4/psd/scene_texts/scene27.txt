UNK: Brandon?
Amanda : Everything with his family... Donny checked out.
Amanda : He wasn't there for me and Brandon was.
Castle : I bet he was.
Amanda : It's not like that. Brandon's a really good guy.
Castle : A good guy who kept the only copy of a video he told us you shot.
Amanda : If Brandon kept the video, he had his reasons.
Castle : Brandon told you to shoot the video that night, didn't he?
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : Guess who just changed his story.
Beckett : Your buddy, Spencer.
Castle : Your comrade just gave up your alibi for Max's murder.
Brandon : You mean Max's suicide, don't you?
UNK: And last I checked, I wouldn't need an alibi for that, would I?
Beckett : The medical examiner concluded that Max's death was a homicide.
