UNK: Hey, if you're looking for lunch money, my wallet's on the nightstand.
Alexis : I lied to you, Dad.
UNK: - Oh, can this wait? - No. You need to know.
UNK: Oh. Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Alexis : Remember the holiday formal,
Alexis : how Kelsey and I went to Taylor's house after?
Alexis : Well, when we left, it was already raining,
UNK: and we tried for, like, half an hour to get a taxi, but we couldn't.
Alexis : And we were already so soaking wet and cold that
Alexis : we finally decided to take the subway, even though it was way after 10 : 00.
Castle : Well, considering that getting a cab in the rain
Castle : is kind of like winning the Powerball jackpot, I forgive you.
UNK: No! Listen. The two was coming, and Kelsey went through the door
Alexis : and was going down the stairs to hold the door for me,
UNK: but when I swiped my card, it was empty.
Alexis : And I didn't have any time to add any more money to it,
Alexis : and Kelsey was screaming for me to come, and I was just so tired,
UNK: and I was just anxious to get home that, Dad, I...
Alexis : I don't even want to say it.
UNK: What?
Alexis : I jumped the turnstile.
Castle : - Did you make the train? - Yeah.
Alexis : But the point is I didn't tell you,
Alexis : even after you were so sweet and concerned yesterday. I'm sorry.
Castle : Oh, you actually jumped the turnstile?
Alexis : But I swiped my card twice the next day and didn't even ride.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Sweetie, if that's the worst thing you've done, I'm a happy, happy man.
