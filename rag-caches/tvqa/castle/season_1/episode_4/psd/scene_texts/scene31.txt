Castle : You know, actually having to prove things is really tedious.
Beckett : - Welcome to my world. - Brandon had this all planned.
Castle : He gets Max to shoot Donny, then gets Max drunk and kills him.
Beckett : There's no such thing as a perfect crime, Castle.
UNK: Not yet. But one day I'm gonna write it.
UNK: Okay. We canvassed every store, stand and homeless guy
Ryan : from the park's entrance at 72nd to the scene.
UNK: And no one remembers seeing Max or Brandon last night.
Beckett : If we can't put Brandon at Max's murder scene,
Beckett : then the DA will never move.
UNK: These kids were hooked on video sharing.
Castle : There has to be something.
UNK: I already scrolled through every video, audio, photo and text file on that thing.
Esposito : Guess we weren't lucky enough to have Max take video of Brandon killing him.
UNK: Funny thing is, if he did, Brandon would have known.
Castle : It would have popped up on his shared folder as soon as their phones...
UNK: - Synced. - Thank you.
UNK: Synced. If they were together when Max was murdered,
UNK: then their phones would have automatically synced.
Beckett : There'd be a record.
Beckett : You have the right to have a lawyer present, Brandon.
Beckett : If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.
Castle : He could afford a million lawyers.
UNK: She still has to advise me of my rights, right?
Headmaster : - Right. - Anyway, that's cool.
Brandon : I don't want a lawyer. This is way more fun.
Beckett : Maybe you'd like to just sign a confession, then?
UNK: Sure.
Brandon : I confess...
Brandon : That I'm dying to cop a feel under your cop blouse.
