Alexis : But I lied to you. Shouldn't you punish me?
Castle : Yes. No, you're right.
Castle : Mandatory ice cream for breakfast. No excuses.
Alexis : I'm serious. If you won't, I will.
UNK: - I'm serious about the ice cream. - Fine. I'm grounded for a week.
Castle : - All right. You're tough but fair. - After the D.C. Trip.
Castle : That's my girl.
Alexis : Thanks, Dad.
Castle : Hey. What you doing?
Beckett : Paperwork to dismiss the homicide charges against Scoville.
Beckett : Ballistics. Confirms that the gun used on Donny in the park that night
Beckett : was the same one Max used on himself.
Beckett : I'm usually better at reading people.
UNK: You spent half an hour with Max.
UNK: There's no way you could have seen that coming.
Beckett : Poor kid must have been a mess.
Beckett : Imagine shooting your best friend and then having to lie about it.
Castle : Well, he did more than just lie about it.
Beckett : What do you mean?
Castle : He went back and moved his friend's body.
Beckett : Having the presence of mind to move the body isn't exactly consistent
UNK: with a guilty conscience, is it?
Castle : I'd say that's more an act of a cold-blooded killer.
