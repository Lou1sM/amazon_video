UNK: No. I'm his mother. What's going on?
Beckett : I need to see him right now, Mrs. Heller. Do you know where he is?
UNK: No, I don't. What is it?
Beckett : I have a warrant for his arrest.
UNK: A warrant? Oh, my God. For what?
Beckett : He's wanted for murder, Mrs. Heller. Do you understand?
Beckett : I need you to go and call him on his cell phone, find out where he is.
UNK: Tell him not to move. Everything is gonna be all right,
Beckett : but I need you to do it now. Detective Esposito will go with you.
Beckett : Get a photograph of him for the APB, please.
UNK: Right.
UNK: Detective.
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : What? Where?
Esposito : Kid's not answering his cell phone. Mom thinks maybe he went to the park.
Beckett : Yeah, he went to the park
Beckett : and killed himself.
UNK: So, what now? What should I do?
UNK: What?
