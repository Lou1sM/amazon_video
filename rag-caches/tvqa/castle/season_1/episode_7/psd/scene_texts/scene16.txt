Beckett : Castle, as a friend, I am asking you not to leave this car,
Beckett : - because your little Hardy Boy act... - Is gonna get me killed, I know.
Beckett : More like get one of them killed,
Beckett : and I can't have that on my conscience. Understood?
Castle : What if I have to pee?
UNK: Go, go, go!
Esposito : NYPD! We have a warrant!
Ryan : Look, his coffee. It's still warm. Must have just missed him.
UNK: This is Detective Castle to all units.
UNK: That's a negatory on the back-up. This dirtbag's all mine.
Beckett : Looks like we got the right place.
Beckett : Police! Police!
Beckett : Stop! Police!
UNK: Follow him out back!
UNK: Oh, God!
Nadir : Out of the car!
Castle : I... She told me, actually, I have to stay in the...
Nadir : - Out of the car now! - Okay! Okay, okay!
UNK: - Here I come. No problem. - Oh, God!
UNK: Oh, God.
Beckett : Go ahead. I need the practice.
UNK: We got him. Get up!
Castle : I tried to stay in the car. I really did. He hit me in the face, you know.
Beckett : Yeah, I saw that.
Castle : That, "Go ahead. I need the practice," that was classic.
Beckett : The other pieces are still in evidence,
Beckett : but I didn't see the harm in returning this.
Joanne : - How do you get over it? - You don't.
Beckett : But one day, you'll wake up, and you'll find that
Beckett : you don't mind carrying it around with you.
Beckett : At least, that's as far as I've come.
