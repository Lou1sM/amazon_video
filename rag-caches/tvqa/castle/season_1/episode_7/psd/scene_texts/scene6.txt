Ryan : No way a standard bump key would work.
Esposito : No. They'd have to use something special.
Esposito : Something your average mope couldn't rig.
Montgomery : - What are you thinking? - Well, I busted this guy a while back.
Esposito : Specialized in bump keys.
Esposito : And he's not afraid to get a little blood on his paws, either.
Montgomery : Bump keys and violence. I like him already.
Montgomery : Evan Mitchell. - Evan Mitchell?
Esposito : - Yeah. You know him? - He has a legacy.
UNK: His dad and his granddad are legends in the industry.
Esposito : Yeah, I collared him on a jewel heist out on Forty-Seventh.
Esposito : He just did a nickel upstate.
Montgomery : When did Mitchell get out?
Esposito : Two weeks before our first heist.
Montgomery : Pick him up.
Ryan : Say hello to his little friend.
Esposito : It was in his waistband when we snatched him up.
Beckett : Serial numbers are scratched off.
Montgomery : Heavy on collars, light on convictions.
Ryan : Amazing how many times a guy can get arrested without ever serving time.
Castle : - He must have a pretty good lawyer. - Or good at what he does.
Castle : Good enough to be our perp?
Ryan : Why do you writers always call them perps?
Castle : Isn't that what you call them?
Ryan : Ah, we got a whole lot of names for them.
Castle : - Yeah. - Pipe-head, pisshead, ork, creep.
Esposito : Crook, knucklehead, chucklehead.
Ryan : - Chud, turd. - Destro, skell.
Ryan : - Skeksi, slicko, slick. - Mope.
UNK: - Sleestak. - Slow down, slow down.
Beckett : Suspects. We call them suspects.
UNK: - I'm old school. I like dirtbag. - Classic.
Beckett : Tell me about the gun, Mr. Mitchell.
Mitchell : Oh, I'm not talking without a lawyer.
Beckett : Why? You guilty of something?
UNK: Yeah, of not running fast enough when your boys showed.
Beckett : Where were you last night between 5 : 00 and 9 : 00?
Mitchell : - I didn't do it. - You didn't do what?
Mitchell : Doesn't matter what. Wherever you think I was, I wasn't.
Beckett : So where were you, then?
Mitchell : Happy hour, little neighborhood place,
