Mitchell : Smart fish don't bite.
UNK: We can hold him on the gun,
UNK: but there's no match with ballistics on Mrs. Delgado.
UNK: And without other evidence to link him to the other homicide...
Beckett : - I'll find something, sir. - Not if his alibi checks out.
Beckett : Sir, it's just pots and kettles.
Montgomery : On the last robbery, not the first.
Montgomery : Mitchell was being arraigned on an unrelated burglary
Montgomery : the same day this crew struck.
Montgomery : Unless you can break his alibi on this one, he's a dead end.
Castle : You got to watch those silhouettes. They can be shifty little bastards.

Castle : Man, when I hit a wall,
Castle : all I got's one of those little stress balls and Internet porn.
UNK: Beckett cont'd : - Castle... - Look, I get it, all right?
UNK: You made a promise to a daughter to find her mother's killer.
UNK: Doesn't take Freud to see what's what.

UNK: Beckett cont'd : It's not a duel, Scaramouche. Here.
UNK: Square off to target. Feet shoulder-distance apart.
UNK: Okay. Gauntlet your right fist in your left palm.
Castle : Whoa! Shot too soon.
Beckett : Yeah, well. You know, we could always just cuddle, Castle.
Castle : Oh, funny. And a smile! Good.
