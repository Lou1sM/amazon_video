Castle : - Keep your guard up. - Then don't distract me.
Castle : Does he know how you feel about him?

UNK: Hey!
Alexis : Because I don't even know how I feel about him.
Castle : Yes! Very nice!
UNK: Hello?
Ryan : How many bones did they have to break to get her in there?
Lanie : Won't know till I get her back to the lab.
