Castle : - It's an undercover operation. - Uh-huh.
Castle : - Would you? - Yeah.
Martha : I don't know why you won't tell me where the party is.
Castle : Because you'll show up.
Beckett : Who was it? - Delivery.
Beckett : - From who? - Let's find out.
UNK: "Bibbity-bobbity-boo"?
Lanie : Oh, please. It's a dress. Now open it up, girlfriend.
Beckett : Oh! I knew he was arrogant, but this, this is complete...
UNK: Oh.
Martha : Stunning. Simply stunning. Come in, come in.
Martha : Oh! Hang on. Hang on.
Alexis : - You look incredible. - Really?
Castle : Really. You clean up nice, Detective Beckett.
Beckett : Thank you, Castle.
UNK: Martha cont'd : I was nominated for a Tony once, and...
Beckett : Oh, no, Martha, I couldn't.
Martha : Yes, you can. Let me...
Martha : Oh! It's brilliant.
Martha : So, where are you guys headed tonight?
Beckett : We're going to The Waldorf.
Esposito : Man, these guys look guilty of tax evasion, not home invasion.
Esposito : Yeah, well, appearances can be deceiving.
UNK: Ryan cont'd : - Nice dress. - Yeah, what there is of it.
Beckett : I'd let you borrow it, Esposito, but you stretched out the last one.
Castle : Big cheese!
UNK: Ricky! Ricky! Hey!
Mayor : Why didn't you tell me you were gonna be at this shindig?
Mayor : - I would've given you a ride. - Oh, last-minute thing.
Castle : Listen, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to present to you Detective Kate Beckett.
Castle : - Kate Beckett, you know the mayor. - So this is Detective Beckett.
Beckett : - It's an honor to meet you, sir. - Please, call me Bob.
Mayor : Rick, she's even prettier than you said.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Mayor : - Excuse me a minute. - Of course.
UNK: - You talk about me to Bob? - Yeah, we play cards together.
UNK: Well, that, and you are the subject of my next book.
Castle : Can I get you a drink?
Beckett : Yeah, vodka. Lots of vodka.
Beckett : But I'm on duty, so water.
Beckett : Yeah. Vodka.
Castle : Could I get two very stiff vodka martinis?
Castle : Don't shake them, just swirl them around a bit.
Bartender : Coming right up. - Richard.
Rachel : Hi. Rachel Maddox. We spoke on the phone.
Castle : And thank you very much for getting me the tickets.
Rachel : Thanks for the signed first edition for the auction.
Paul : I had my eye on it, but it's probably too rich for my blood.
Rachel : Oh! My boyfriend, Paul Reynolds. He is a huge fan.
Castle : Oh, always nice to meet a fan.
Ruthie : Don't sweat it. That's just Rachel, Anne's Head of Development.
UNK: She's only after his money, so to speak. Oh, I'm Ruthie.
Beckett : I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.
Beckett : Do you work for the charity?
Alexis : No. No. But I am on the circuit.
Ruthie : You know, breast cancer, land mines. You know what the best one is?
Ruthie : That project, what do you call it, the one with the lips?
Ruthie : There are a lot of plastic surgeons there.
Ruthie : - Fish in a barrel. - Really?
Ruthie : Oh! Not that you need any help from me.
Ruthie : I see you've got a big one on the line. Settle in, Katie. I hear he's a fighter.
Beckett : Sorry, Castle?
UNK: Oh, most of the girls on the register have tried to land him.
