Lanie : probably from sitting too much.
Lanie : And the last thing he had to eat was a pastrami sandwich.
Lanie : None of which will get you an ID.
UNK: His hands were callused, suggesting physical labor,
Ryan : and yet he spent too much time sitting?
UNK: Maybe he drove a forklift. I don't know.
UNK: Come on. We need something concrete now.
Lanie : Then I can't help you.
Esposito : Lanie, they're out there,
Esposito : God knows where and what kind of trouble they're in.
Lanie : You don't think I want to help? They're my friends, too.
Ryan : So Beckett said with enough time,
Ryan : you might be able to recover prints.
Lanie : Yeah. In a couple of days. Why?
Esposito : What happens if you do it now?
UNK: I could damage the print beyond recognition.
UNK: Could. So it's possible that it might not, right?
