Ryan : We don't know. We just know they were on the case.
Esposito : Did Spooner say anything to you about the New York operation?
Martinez : All he said was,
UNK: "It's not at all what you think."
GATES : Troopers found his semi.
Gates : Truck stop north of the city. Let's go, boys.
UNK: State Trooper Mcnichols : According to truck stop records, the rig's been parked here for three days.
UNK: State Trooper Mcnichols : No one's seen the driver for two.
UNK: You're gonna want to take a look inside.
UNK: It's hair. These could be air holes.
Ryan : Hey. Over here.
CASTLE : Still too high.
Beckett : Not if I climb on your shoulders.
Beckett : What? We've done it before.
Castle : Yeah, you say that like it was pleasant. And we weren't handcuffed.
Beckett : Who's got no faith now?
UNK: Come on, Castle, we have no idea when they're coming back
Beckett : or even if they're coming back at all.
Castle : Last time, you were wearing sneakers.
UNK: Fine.
UNK: Think I'm gonna need your help.
UNK: "Lift up my shirt." "Pull off my boots."
Castle : Under normal circumstances, I would like where this was heading.
Beckett : You can fantasize later after we get out of the room.
Castle : Just so you know, not as much fun if I have your permission.
Castle : How do you run in these things?
Beckett : Shut up and pull.
Gates : Agent Martinez, are you sure these guys were smuggling drugs?
Martinez : If I had answers, I'd share.
Esposito : Captain Gates...
UNK: What'd you find? Waybills.
Ryan : Spooner delivered to a furniture store in Lower Manhattan two days ago.
Gates : Get on it. Yeah.
Gates : Call your bosses.
Gates : Tell them I want all the files on this investigation.
Gates : I'm getting my people back.
UNK: Okay, ready?
UNK: Ready.
UNK: One, two, three. Go!
Beckett : Oh, jeez.
UNK: BECKETT GRUNTING
UNK: GRUNTING
UNK: Whoa! Castle! Okay, can you put me down?
UNK: Okay. Easy.
UNK: PANTING
Castle : If we ever get out of here, we should seriously consider joining the circus.
Beckett : Let me try it from behind, okay?
Castle : All right, I'm game.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Ready? Ready.
Castle : One, two, three.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Okay, I'm lifting my right hand. Ready?
UNK: Okay.
Castle : Not so fun as I would have thought.
UNK: You know, I'm getting a little tired of you walking all over me.
BECKETT : It's open.
Castle : Okay. I think I can pull myself...
UNK: BECKETT SCREAMING
Beckett : Hey! Let us out of here!
Castle : What do you want from us?
Esposito : Captain Gates, furniture store owner verified
