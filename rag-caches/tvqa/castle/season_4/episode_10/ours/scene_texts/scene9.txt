Beckett : So the others are all cinder block.
Beckett : If we start digging we might be able to break through and help her.
Castle : How is getting out of one prison and into another gonna help any of us?

UNK: HAMMERING
Esposito : Yeah. Okay. The moment you hear. Thanks.
UNK: CSU? Yeah.
Esposito : Negative on prints from the house. Place was wiped.
UNK: What'd you get from the Registrar?
Ryan : Well, the house was foreclosed on five months ago.
Ryan : It's still owned by National Bank.
UNK: Our guys must've been squatting.
Esposito : Did you say National Bank? Yeah, why?
Esposito : The files Agent Martinez sent over.
UNK: Yeah.
Esposito : Spooner made a delivery to a Brooklyn house two months ago.
UNK: A couple days later, the Feds raided the place,
Esposito : but by then, whoever w as in the house was gone.
Esposito : All they found was a hatch cut into the floor which accessed the basement.
Ryan : Sounds familiar.
UNK: Yeah, but when they traced the property,
UNK: it was bank-owned. By National Bank.
Ryan : Our guys must be targeting distressed properties to run their operations from.
Esposito : Okay, get a list of all the National Bank owned properties in the New York area,
Esposito : starting with the properties that have a basement.
Esposito : If they're working off the National Bank foreclosure list,
UNK: that may be where they're finding their safe houses.

UNK: and both are situated in between empty lots or unoccupied houses,
Ryan : minimizing the nosy-neighbor factor.
UNK: Now you cross reference all that,
UNK: it leaves us with 11 likelies in the outer boroughs.
UNK: STRAINING
UNK: Beckett.
Beckett : What do we do?
Gates : Divvy up the list.
Gates : Get unis out to all 11 properties.
Gates : And let's bring them back alive.
