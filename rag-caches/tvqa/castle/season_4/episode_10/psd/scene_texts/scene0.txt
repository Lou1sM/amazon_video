UNK: Hmm. Don't get up yet. Stay in bed.
UNK: Castle.
Castle : Kate. Hi.
UNK: Castle! What?
Beckett : Did you do this? What?
UNK: Stop saying "what" and wake up!
Castle : I don't...
Castle : We're handcuffed.
UNK: It's kinky.
Beckett : Castle, it's not funny.
UNK: I didn't say "funny," I said "kinky." And I didn't cuff us.
Beckett : You think I cuffed us?
Castle : Well, they look like police cuffs.
Beckett : Somebody else did this to us.
Beckett : Do you recognize this place?
UNK: No.
Castle : But if I were writing a book, this is where bad things would happen.
Beckett : My watch is missing.
