UNK: Help!
UNK: Help! BECKETT : Help us!
Esposito : Your boys shoot,
Esposito : I swear, the last thing I do is put a bullet right through your head.
Esposito : Your choice.
Ruth : You New Yorkers ain't nearly as scary as a Texas lawman.
Ruth : That being said, I'm betting more of you are gonna be here soon.
