Beckett : Castle, would you just work with me?
CASTLE : How about you work with me?
Castle : How come you always have to lead?
Castle : How come you always have to step on my toes?
Castle : Since when do...
Castle : Okay, you know what? Tell me this,
Castle : why do you always have to be first?
Castle : First out of the elevator, first through the door.
Beckett : I am a cop. I'm the one with a gun.
Beckett : Being first through the door is my job.
Castle : In the elevator?
UNK: Look, how about this?
Castle : Would it kill you to let someone open the door for you once in a while?
UNK: You do realize if somebody opens the door for me,
Beckett : then I will be going through it first anyway, right?
Castle : Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot.
Castle : You have to be the smartest, too.
Castle : Everything's a competition with you.
Beckett : That is so not true. Are you always like this in the mornings?
Castle : You know, I'd argue with you, but then I'd have to let you win.
Beckett : Okay, fine, go ahead. You lead.
