ESPOSITO : Timestamp puts this at five hours ago.
RYAN : So that's Beckett's car.
Ryan : But that's not Castle or Beckett.
ESPOSITO : And he's not alone. Someone picked him up.
GATES : Do we know who they are?
Esposito : No clue.
Gates : Can we get a plate number?
Ryan : Too far away.
Esposito : We also ran Beckett and Castle's cells. They're both off grid.
Gates : What the hell did Castle get her into?
Gates : I want CSU on that car with a fine-tooth comb
Gates : for any possible trace evidence.
Gates : They were working the John Doe with you. Where could they have gone?
Ryan : Been over it a dozen times. We still don't know.
UNK: Still no hits on our long-haired man from the cafe.
Gates : Do whatever it takes to get an ID on that victim.
Gates : And find out what in the hell he was into.
Gates : If Beckett and Castle are still out there,
Gates : then they're running out of time.
UNK: CLICKING
Beckett : For God's sake, Castle. How much longer are you gonna keep doing this?
Castle : I almost had it.
Beckett : Yeah, like you had it the last 100 times.
