UNK: So?
Ryan : So wear the ring.
UNK: I wanna see if women still flirt with you and ignore me.
Esposito : So you didn't want Castle to come because
UNK: all the women would flirt with him.
UNK: All the women would flirt with him.
Ryan : I want to know if it's just the ring
Ryan : that's repelling members of the fairer sex.
Esposito : It's not the ring, bro. It's you.
Esposito : See, once you've been married for a little while,
Esposito : and you're feeling a little bored and unsatisfied,
Esposito : the ring will get you love from the ladies.
UNK: They'll wanna take you away from all that,
UNK: so that you can be bored and unsatisfied with them.
Ryan : Why not now?
Esposito : 'Cause now you're all blissfully happy with your wife and whatnot.
Esposito : You have the stink of honeymoon phase all over you.
Esposito : No woman wants to be around that.
Ryan : How long does it last?
Esposito : It's hard to say.
Esposito : But knowing you and Jenny, probably forever.
UNK: SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING
Chantal : Oh, yeah, Barbie.
UNK: All she wanted was to be a dancer on Broadway.
Ryan : She used to talk about it a lot, huh?
Chantal : More than that.
Chantal : She got a makeover, changed her hair.
Chantal : And then two years ago, she got her nose done,
Chantal : even though her nose looked fine before.
Esposito : Back in the day, did Barbra have trouble with anybody?
Esposito : Say, a customer? Maybe a boyfriend?
Chantal : Boyfriend, yeah. Jason.
UNK: Could this be him?
Chantal : That's him. Jason Bagwell.
Ryan : Do you know where we can find Jason?
Chantal : He lived over in Alphabet City.
Chantal : He was always running some scam.
Chantal : Borrowing money from Barbra for some new business venture,
