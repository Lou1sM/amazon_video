Castle : In one move, Barbra builds herself a better future. A perfect life.
Beckett : Until she was murdered a year later.
Castle : Yes, well, separated twin stories never end happily.
UNK: Blood tests are back. Odette and Barbra were not biologically related.
Esposito : Barbra has no living family we could find.
CASTLE : If they're not related, how can Barbra look so much like Odette?
ESPOSITO : I don't know,
Esposito : but we do have an address for her former place of employment.
Esposito : A strip club in Midtown.
Ryan : See, we've been operating on the theory
UNK: that Odette was murdered because she was Odette.
Ryan : But what if she was murdered because she was really Barbra?
BECKETT : Find out everything you can about Barbra.
UNK: In the meantime, I'm gonna re-interview Odette's brother, Paul.
Castle : Is he a person of interest now?
Beckett : I'm just having trouble believing
Beckett : that Barbra managed to fool Odette's own brother for over a year.
UNK: He's gonna have to convince me that he didn't know.
