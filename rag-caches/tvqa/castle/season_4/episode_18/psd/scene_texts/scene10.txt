UNK: Meantime, I'm gonna take a ride downtown with the boys,
Castle : check out that strip club...
Ryan : Sorry, Castle. Three's a crowd.
Esposito : What's up? Why are you freezing out our boy like that?
UNK: I wanna try an experiment. Having Castle along would mess things up.
UNK: Here.
Ryan : Wear my wedding ring.
UNK: What? Get that thing away from me, man. It's a mood killer.
Ryan : Just wear it when we're at the club. What for?
Ryan : See, I've been talking to my married guy friends,
Ryan : they say that your theory is way off.
Ryan : Wearing a wedding ring gets them more attention from women, not less.
