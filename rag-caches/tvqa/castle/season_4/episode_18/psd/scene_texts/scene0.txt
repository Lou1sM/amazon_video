UNK: Martha Rodgers : Guess who I ran into at the beauty parlor today?
UNK: Mother, I'm at a critical juncture in...
Martha : Oona Marconi.
Martha : Oona Marconi, the theater critic?
Martha : I thought I might invite her to dinner,
Martha : ask her to give a little mention to my acting school,
Martha : put it into one of her columns.
Martha : It would be invaluable publicity.
Castle : Yes, well that would depend on the mention.
Castle : You aren't forgetting her blistering review of your performance of Maggie
Martha : That was 1983. I think I'm over it.
Castle : "Martha Rodgers as Maggie the Cat is more of a helpless kitten,
UNK: "mewing and flapping her hands when she doesn't get her way."
Martha : You memorized it?
Castle : I couldn't help it.
Castle : You walked around the apartment quoting it for months!
UNK: Mother, I'm just saying,
Castle : maybe it's not a good idea to ask an important favor
UNK: of someone who's been so unkind to you in the past.
Martha : The operative word here is "past."
Martha : I think I can rise above.
Martha : Besides, my acting school is more important to me than some old grudge.
