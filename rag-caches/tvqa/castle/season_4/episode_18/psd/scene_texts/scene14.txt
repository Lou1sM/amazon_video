Jason : Two weeks ago, she showed up on my doorstep and told me the whole story.
Beckett : Barbra had everything she could want. A perfect life.
Beckett : Why would she risk it all by getting in touch with you?
Jason : Because she missed me.
Jason : And Odette's life wasn't as perfect as Barbra thought.
Jason : Barbra was lonely and she wanted to get back together.
UNK: She told me she had found out some stuff about Odette.
Jason : Secrets from her past. What kind of secrets?
Jason : I don't know, but she said if anyone found out,
Jason : it would all be over for her.
Castle : You think this secret got her killed?
Jason : She said she could use it to her advantage.
Jason : She just needed more information. Information was leverage.
Jason : It would protect her.
Jason : But she had to move fast.
Beckett : And she didn't move fast enough.
JASON : Barbra had been dancing since she was a little kid
Jason : and all she ever wanted was to be a star on Broadway.
Jason : And she was so close.
