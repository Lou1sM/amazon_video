Beckett : You get a good enough look at this guy?
Beckett : You think you can provide us with a sketch?
Eddie : Yeah, I can do that.
Ryan : Hey. So Eddie Gordon spoke the truth.
Ryan : He was meeting with his agent when Odette was shot.
Castle : So maybe he was also telling the truth
Castle : about the guy he saw Odette with in the alley.
Ryan : Well, he gave us a sketch. Pretty generic, though.
UNK: Handsome, Caucasian, dark hair.
Castle : You know, that missing half hour
Castle : when Odette left rehearsal the day she was shot,
Castle : maybe she was with him.
Ryan : I'll have uniforms circulate the sketch around the studio.
Ryan : See if anybody recognizes him.
Castle : Okay, so if Odette had straightened up after the train accident,
Castle : what was she doing behind the stage door
Castle : secretly giving some guy a roll of bills?
Ryan : Could be a drug deal.
Ryan : Maybe Odette was falling back into old habits.
Ryan : Any recent withdrawals in her bank statement?
Beckett : Yeah, not for that amount of money,
Beckett : but check out these credit card payments.
Beckett : For the last six months,
Beckett : Odette's credit card spending was pretty much steady.
Beckett : And then about a month ago, it suddenly shot up.
Castle : No kidding.
UNK: Her cards were maxed out. Over 100 grand in charges?
Castle : What was she spending all that money on?
Beckett : You were Odette's business manager,
Beckett : as well as the executor of her grandfather's estate?
UNK: Samuel Lynchberg : And now I have the unfortunate task of handling Odette's estate as well.
Beckett : And who inherits her share of the family trust?
Lynchberg : Per Odette's wishes, it goes to the Graham Morton Foundation.
Lynchberg : It's a charitable organization.
Beckett : You know, I noticed a pretty big spike
Beckett : in her spending over the last month.
