UNK: And I said to her,
UNK: "We didn't risk everything to get this money
UNK: "so you could let it ruin your life."
Lynchberg : And she looked at me
Lynchberg : and I could tell she had no idea what I was talking about.
Lynchberg : In that moment, I knew that she wasn't my Odette.
Castle : And that's how she got onto you.
Lynchberg : So this Barbra told me that if I kept her secret, she would keep mine.
Lynchberg : She thought we were even.
Lynchberg : She thought that she could just take the place of Odette.
Lynchberg : What was I supposed to do?
Lynchberg : Just let some dirty stripper live in her house and wear her clothes,
Lynchberg : and blackmail me?
Lynchberg : Odette deserved better.
