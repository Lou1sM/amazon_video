UNK: ELEVATOR DINGS
Castle : She should not be on this case.
Esposito : Well, she's not just gonna walk away.
UNK: No, she's gonna drive herself into the ground.
UNK: And you're the only one who has any clue as to what she's going through.
Castle : So what helped you?
Beckett : Espo, what are we doing back here?
Esposito : I want to show you something.
Beckett : What is that?
UNK: The rifle that shot you.
Beckett : You are way out of line.
Esposito : Just look at it.
Beckett : What the hell are you doing?
Esposito : I've been where you are, I know what you're going through.
Beckett : Javi, I'm fine. You're not fine.
Esposito : You're just trying to act like you are.
Esposito : This is just a tool.
Esposito : It's a hunk of steel.
Esposito : It has no magical powers,
Esposito : and the person that fired it is not some all-powerful God.
Esposito : Just a guy with a gun.
Esposito : Just like the guy we're hunting now.
Esposito : And like every other bad guy he's damaged goods.
