Beckett : Those people that you blame, they're no different from you.
Lee : You're just saying that 'cause you're one of them.
Esposito : You think my life is a picnic?
Beckett : I know what it feels like to be in those crosshairs.
Beckett : To feel the bullet burn through my chest.
Beckett : I know what it feels like to have my life leave my body.
Beckett : And I think you do, too.
Beckett : That's why you keep leaving those paper dolls behind
Beckett : because you're looking for somebody to help you find another way.
Lee : There is no other way.
Lee : Not anymore. It's too late.
UNK: No, no, no.
Beckett : There's always another way.
Beckett : I want to help you. I know that you're in pain
Beckett : and we can find a better voice for your pain.
Beckett : Please, just put that gun down. Just turn around.
UNK: No. Don't look at me. Just turn around.
UNK: No! Turn around!
UNK: No, if you're gonna shoot me you look at me in the eyes.
Beckett : Okay? And you look hard,
Beckett : because I'm not your enemy, I can't be.
Beckett : You and I have too much in common.
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
Lee : No, we don't.
Lee : I have a job to do.
Beckett : I'm sorry.
UNK: GUN FIRES
UNK: THUDDING
UNK: EXHALES
UNK: Hey.
UNK: Hey.
Beckett : What are you doing?
Castle : Just waiting for my partner.
Castle : Maybe you've seen her.
Castle : Pretty girl.
Castle : Thinks she can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Castle : Carries the weight of the world on her shoulders,
Castle : yet still manages to laugh at some of my jokes.
Beckett : She sounds like a handful.
Castle : Tell me about it.
Castle : Anyway, if you do see her,
Castle : tell her she owes me about 100 coffees.
UNK: Castle?
Beckett : Thank you.
Gates : For what?
Beckett : For not pushing, giving me the space to get through this.
UNK: Always.
