UNK: And then she isn't.
UNK: Kate...
Beckett : You know, he saw her face when he killed her.
Beckett : People always think that snipers are so removed from their targets.
Beckett : But he wasn't.
Beckett : He was as close as we are right now, looking through that scope.
Castle : We're gonna catch this guy.
Beckett : Yeah, like we caught the guy that shot me.
UNK: GUN FIRES
UNK: SCREAMS
UNK: PEOPLE SHOUTING
UNK: GASPS
UNK: BEEPS
UNK: SCREAMING
UNK: GRUNTING
UNK: WOMAN SCREAMS
UNK: Martha Rogers : Oh, darling, I hope you haven't been up all night.
UNK: Yeah, I couldn't sleep.
Castle : Two days, two people dead.
Castle : Someone out there is waking up
Castle : not knowing they're going to be murder number three.
UNK: Alexis Castle : I think I just decided to skip school today.
UNK: Actually, I think you're bot under house arrest until we catch this guy.
UNK: I can only imagine how this sniper must be affecting Beckett.
Castle : She says she's fine.
UNK: So what are you gonna do?
Castle : The only thing I can do.
Castle : Try to figure out why he's leaving these damn dolls behind.
Castle : If I could just figure out what painting they're from.
Alexis : Let me see.
UNK: Chiaroscuro.
Castle : You recognize that?
Alexis : It's a style of painting that was invented during the Renaissance,
Alexis : exemplified by strong contrasts between light and dark.
Alexis : We learned about it in Art History.
Alexis : Try looking up Caravaggio or Peterzano.
UNK: TAPPING ON KEYBOARD
Castle : Can I just say, this school of yours is worth every penny I paid.
Castle : Hey, this might be it.
UNK: "Peterzano. The Persecution of Kings."
RYAN : Beckett.
Ryan : DNA on the moleskin was a bust.
GATES : Ryan, you got results?
Ryan : There were no matches in the CODIS database.
Ryan : The best the lab was able to do was DNA phenotyping.
Ryan : They say they think our sniper is a male with light hair and brown eyes.
Ryan : But that still leaves us with over 200 suspects on our list.
GATES : I wouldn't cut down the list yet.
Gates : Given what we went through with the shell casing,
UNK: there's a chance the moleskin's not even his.
Castle : I know what the paper dolls mean!
Gates : Mr. Castle, now is not the time for your theatrics.
Castle : Captain, just listen. The paper dolls are predictive.
Castle : The dolls are cut out of paintings
Castle : that literally tell us the location of the next target.
Castle : The one that we found at the first shooting,
Castle : it comes from a painting called The Persecution of Kings.
Ryan : Henry Wyatt was killed on King Street.
UNK: Exactly.
UNK: The one we found at the hide at the second shooting,
Castle : that's from a painting called The Fall From Grace.
Beckett : There's a Grace Avenue in the Bronx.
UNK: Grace Church is on 10th Street and 4th Avenue.
Castle : And there's about a dozen other possibilities.
Castle : If we can narrow it down, we might be able to stop him from...
UNK: PHONES RINGING
CASTLE : Beckett!
UNK: Beckett! SIREN WAILING
UNK: Grace!
UNK: PEOPLE CLAMORING
WOMAN : Right this way.
Beckett : How many people are dead? MAN : None.
Castle : Thank God. Yeah.
Emt : Sniper opened fire through a window
Emt : of a conference room on the 15th floor.
