RYAN : Beckett.
Ryan : DNA on the moleskin was a bust.
GATES : Ryan, you got results?
Ryan : There were no matches in the CODIS database.
Ryan : The best the lab was able to do was DNA phenotyping.
Ryan : They say they think our sniper is a male with light hair and brown eyes.
Ryan : But that still leaves us with over 200 suspects on our list.
GATES : I wouldn't cut down the list yet.
Gates : Given what we went through with the shell casing,
UNK: there's a chance the moleskin's not even his.
Castle : I know what the paper dolls mean!
Gates : Mr. Castle, now is not the time for your theatrics.
Castle : Captain, just listen. The paper dolls are predictive.
Castle : The dolls are cut out of paintings
Castle : that literally tell us the location of the next target.
Castle : The one that we found at the first shooting,
Castle : it comes from a painting called The Persecution of Kings.
Ryan : Henry Wyatt was killed on King Street.
UNK: Exactly.
UNK: The one we found at the hide at the second shooting,
Castle : that's from a painting called The Fall From Grace.
Beckett : There's a Grace Avenue in the Bronx.
UNK: Grace Church is on 10th Street and 4th Avenue.
Castle : And there's about a dozen other possibilities.
Castle : If we can narrow it down, we might be able to stop him from...
UNK: PHONES RINGING
CASTLE : Beckett!
UNK: Beckett! SIREN WAILING
UNK: Grace!
UNK: PEOPLE CLAMORING
WOMAN : Right this way.
Beckett : How many people are dead? MAN : None.
Castle : Thank God. Yeah.
Emt : Sniper opened fire through a window
Emt : of a conference room on the 15th floor.
Beckett : Is anyone else injured?
Emt : No, just her. Her name is Emily Reese,
Emt : and he only shot at her. WHIMPERING
Beckett : Emily, my name is Detective Kate Beckett.
Beckett : I need you to tell me what happened.
UNK: SOBBING Why me?
Emily : What did I do?
Emily : Why is somebody trying to kill me?
UNK: Emily, have you seen anybo watching you lately?
UNK: No. I don't know. I don't know!
Emt : We got to get her No! to the hospital.

UNK: No, you're gonna be okay, Emily.

UNK: CRYING Please, please, no!
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: Kate!
UNK: SOBBING
Chris : I can't...
Castle : She's spinning out of control. She's losing her ability to cope.
UNK: ELEVATOR DINGS
Castle : She should not be on this case.
Esposito : Well, she's not just gonna walk away.
UNK: No, she's gonna drive herself into the ground.
UNK: And you're the only one who has any clue as to what she's going through.
