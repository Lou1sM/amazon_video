Alexis : Dad, are you using me as a shield against flesh-eating zombies?
Castle : No, no, I just wanted you to have a better view.
Castle : Whoa. Whoa, where are you going?
Castle : I really think we're safer in pairs.
Alexis : Sorry, Dad, you're gonna have to fend for yourself.
Alexis : I'm skyping with Ashley.

Castle : and you are very thoughtful to be so accommodating, sweetheart.
Castle : But a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect.
Castle : I mean, think about what kind of signal you're sending
Castle : if you are the one always rearranging your schedule

Castle : I mean, if you just drop everything the very moment that...
UNK: PHONE RINGS
Beckett : I'm sorry.
Castle : Hang on.
Castle : Detective Beckett.
Castle : I'll be right there.
