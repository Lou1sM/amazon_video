UNK: And yet there he is.
Castle : Of course, he might just be here to fix a busted toilet.
Castle : Need a hand with that, Fuller?
Beckett : Detective Smith?
Castle : Detective Beckett.
UNK: It was you, all this time. Why?
UNK: Steve Fuller : You know, he was abusing her.
Smith : Terrible things.
Smith : I don't think a month went by when we didn't get called up to this house.
UNK: And one day, I stopped by in the afternoon to check on her.
Beckett : You were the affair.
Smith : It wasn't an affair! It was love.
UNK: Then why'd you kill her?
Ryan : I didn't mean to. It just...
Smith : She wanted to call it off with me,
Smith : and I couldn't let that happen.
Beckett : And Matt Benton?
Smith : The way he treated her? He deserved what he got.
Beckett : As the lead officer, you knew you could steer the investigation off yourself
Beckett : and onto someone they'd never find.
Castle : And then you sent those postcards to keep your suspect alive.
Smith : Let them think that he did it. It was his fault anyway.
Beckett : What about Jack Sinclair? How'd you find out about him?
Smith : I promised Fuller that I would solve this case one day.
Smith : I asked him to keep me informed of any developments.
Beckett : So that when Jack contacted Fuller
Beckett : about the crime scene, he called you.
Castle : And when we told Fuller we were gonna check out that room tomorrow,
