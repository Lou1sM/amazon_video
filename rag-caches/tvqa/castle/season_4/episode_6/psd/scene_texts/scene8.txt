Castle : that preceded Jack Sinclair's murder.
UNK: Except Jack only had an EMF meter. I've got a gun.
Beckett : And a flashlight.
Castle : With dead batteries.
Beckett : I could swear I just put in new ones.
Beckett : I know I saw some matches by one of these candles here.
Beckett : Wow, Castle, mature.
UNK: Sorry.
Beckett : Yeah. Here we go.
UNK: WHOOSHING
UNK: Castle...
Castle : That was not me.
Beckett : Okay, so maybe there's a draft here.
UNK: Right?
UNK: Wait, I think I feel it right here. Give me a boost.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Ready? Yep.
Beckett : Oh, God, Castle!
CASTLE : GRUNTS This is easy.
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: Hey!
UNK: Castle, come on, just hold still. Jeez!
UNK: CLATTERING
UNK: That's the noise on theta right before Jack Sinclair was killed.
UNK: Okay. I'm gonna go up. Ready? Grab my legs.
UNK: GASPS Castle, I said legs, okay?
UNK: Oh! Legs, sorry.
Lanie : Not as sorry as I was.
Lanie : I'm around dead people all day,
Lanie : when I get home I want a live one.
Esposito : I was tired.
UNK: LAUGHING
Jenny : I can't believe we waited so long to do this, babe.
Ryan : Yeah, yeah, it really did turn out to be a perfect night.
Ryan : I would like to propose a toast.
Ryan : I know that it's kind of corny,
Ryan : but it's me, so, well, there we go.
Ryan : To best friends. Now, and forever.
UNK: Cheers.
Esposito : And, to the future newlyweds Oh!!
UNK: Cheers. RYAN : You are so thoughtful.
UNK: Steve Fuller : You know, Kevin said you guys made a great couple,
UNK: but I had no idea. So,
Jenny : when are you two getting married?
CASTLE : Isn't this awkward?
Beckett : Yeah, well, secret passageways
Beckett : aren't supposed to be the most convenient of places.
Castle : The killer could have hung upside-down from this bar
Castle : when he slit Jack Sinclair's throat.
Castle : That would provide you with your demon-free explanation
Castle : of the undisturbed blood spatter.
Beckett : Well, Castle, I appreciate the assist.
Beckett : But I could do without the massage.
Castle : What are you talking about?
Beckett : Aren't you rubbing my neck? SQUEAKS
UNK: No!
