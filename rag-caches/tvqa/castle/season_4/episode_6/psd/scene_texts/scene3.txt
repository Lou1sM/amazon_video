Beckett : And what was he remembering exactly?
Mercy : A woman. A lot of blood. A man with a knife.
Castle : Who was the man?
Mercy : He said the face was blurred, but getting clearer.
Mercy : I told him
Mercy : if he returned to the room where it happened,
Mercy : it might all come back to him.
UNK: "Mercy, I can see it." That's the murderer's face.
Beckett : Jack recovered the memory just before he was killed.
