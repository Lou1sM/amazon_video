Castle : Maybe the evidence of his return will be in that alcove.
Castle : It's worth a shot.
Beckett : We'll go first thing in the morning, see what we come up with.
UNK: You want to go now?
Castle : Well, unless, of course, you're afraid.
Beckett : Yeah, right. No, I get it.
Castle : I mean, it is a haunted house.
Beckett : I'm not scared, Castle.
UNK: No, no. You're right, you're right.
Castle : I mean, the demon has tasted fresh blood,
UNK: it's thirst may not be slake with just one victim.
UNK: Okay, come on.
UNK: Listen, if you're not scared,
Castle : just say it.
UNK: No.
UNK: Come on. You know you want to.
UNK: I don't wanna say it, Castle.
Castle : For me. Please?
Castle : Thank you.
BECKETT : I don't know, Castle.
Beckett : There have been a lot of murder investigations in here over the years.
Beckett : And I think
Beckett : they would have found a secret room, if there actually was one.
Castle : Not if it was hidden well enough.
UNK: You know, you're gonna regret it, if we actually find this room.
Castle : Why is that?
Beckett : Because then you're gonna have to admit
Beckett : that there is no demon behind all of this.
UNK: And it's nothing more than a boring old psycho-killer hiding in a room.
UNK: Well, unless it's a psycho-killer possessed by a demon.
Beckett : Why are you so determined to find the supernatural in all of this?
Beckett : Why are you so determined not to?
Beckett : You know what,
Beckett : I am just following the evidence, wherever it may lead.
