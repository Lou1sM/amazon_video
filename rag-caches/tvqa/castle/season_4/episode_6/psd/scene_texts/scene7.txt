Beckett : And as a cop, I'm going to consider every possible worldly explanation.
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Castle : And what if there is none?
Beckett : Well, then I'm open to the alternative.
UNK: LAUGHS
UNK: You?
Castle : Skepticus Maximus?
Beckett : You know what, just because I don't talk about it nonstop,
Beckett : doesn't mean I don't believe
Beckett : in another plane.
Beckett : I've actually had my own experiences.
Castle : Get out. Like what?
Beckett : When I was a little girl, my parents rented a cabin by a lake.
Beckett : And one night, I had to go to the bathroom...
Beckett : You know what, you're just gonna think I'm crazy.
Jack : No, no, no, no! Go ahead. Tell me.
Beckett : And on the way there
Beckett : I heard this voice whispering,
UNK: WHISPERING "Kate. Kate."
Beckett : It was coming from this room that the owners had locked up,
Beckett : and told my parents never to go in it.
UNK: Except that night, there is this weird glow underneath the door.
UNK: And then I heard t he voice again. "Kate."
Beckett : And so I walked up to the door.
Beckett : And this time it wasn't locked.
UNK: SOFTLY And I turned the doorknob.
Beckett : And I opened it up and then I saw it...
Castle : What was it? What did you see?
UNK: LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY
Castle : Very funny. LAUGHS
Castle : Yes, you got me.
Beckett : How long have you known me, Castle?
Beckett : Of course I don't believe in ghosts.
Castle : What was that?
Beckett : Well, that's odd.
Castle : No, that's more than just odd.
Castle : This is the same sequence of events
