Charlie : and my friend is dead and the money's still gone.
Beckett : So the boys checked security footage
Beckett : and they said that Charlie was on the casino floor the whole night.
UNK: He could've paid someone.
Beckett : Yeah, but why would he kill Sam before he got his money?
Beckett : And if Sam actually stole something,
Beckett : why wasn't he on a plane to Barbados?
Beckett : Why was he wasting his time coming up to New York?
Gates : And how is all this connecte to the property in Queens?
Beckett : I think we're missing something.
Beckett : There's some piece of the puzzle
Beckett : that'll help make all of Sam's seemingly random actions make sense.
Beckett : Actually, that's something that Castle's pretty good at.
Beckett : Taking a look at what we have and then helping to find that piece.
UNK: Mr. Castle likes to throw a whole lot of crazy theorie against the wall.
UNK: Real detectives don't have that luxury.
UNK: It's our job to look at the facts.
UNK: The bank report indicates that Sam moved the money at 9 : 47 a.m.
UNK: via electronic transfer on their website.
UNK: If we can find out who Sam talked to or met with right before that,
UNK: we could maybe figure out what's going on.
UNK: 9 : 47 Yes?
