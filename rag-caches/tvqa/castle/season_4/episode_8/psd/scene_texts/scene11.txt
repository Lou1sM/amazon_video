Beckett : Sam's assistant has him
Beckett : at a massage.
UNK: Yeah. Mr. Siegel had an hour session yesterday at 9 : 00.
UNK: Why?
Ryan : Well, we need to know if Sam made or received any phone calls
Ryan : or perhaps any visitors during his session?
Amber : No, he was very focused on the service.
UNK: Amber, we know he went online at 9 : 47.
UNK: We just need to know if he made contact
UNK: with anybody right before or right after?
Amber : I told you, he wasn't on the phone, and he wasn't online.
Castle : What with mobile devices being so small and slim,
Castle : perhaps he had it in his hand...
Amber : His hands were otherwise occupied.
UNK: CHUCKLING Oh, I get it.
Castle : That kind of massage.
UNK: So then, Sam didn't make the transfer.
Esposito : He didn't steal the money, somebody stole it from him.
Ryan : Amber, we need to know
UNK: if perhaps there's anything maybe unusual about the appointment?
