Castle : The last time I saw you in your PJs after 8 : 00 a.m.,
UNK: I think you were four.
Alexis : We're off today. Teachers' retreat.
Alexis : I didn't feel like getting dressed.
Castle : This wouldn't have anything to do with Ashley, would it?
Alexis : Did I do the right thing, breaking up with him?
Castle : Oh, sweetie, I don't know. That's something only you can answer.
Alexis : It sucks. I miss him a lot.
Castle : Yeah, well, you're not doing yourself any favors
Castle : sitting around reading Pride and Prejudice.
Castle : That's just going to make it worse.
Castle : You might as well be listening to Adele.
Alexis : Hey, she totally gets it, and so does Jane Austen.
Castle : You know what you need?
Alexis : A new life?
Castle : A distraction.
Castle : And it just so happens I know the perfect post-breakup routine.
Castle : Tonight, you and I go get chili-cheese dogs from Gray's Papaya,
UNK: we smuggle them into a double feature at the Angelika.
Alexis : I know you mean well,
Alexis : but I don't think going out with my dad
Alexis : is going to make me feel better.
Castle : Well, how about just a low-key evening with your girlfriends?
Castle : You guys can have a John Hughes marathon and fill out a Cosmoquiz.
Alexis : Dad, the '80s just called. It wants its plan back.
