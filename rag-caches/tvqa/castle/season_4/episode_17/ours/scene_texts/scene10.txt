ALEXIS : She was worried you wouldn't make it.
Castle : Break a leg, Mother. We have a schedule to keep.
UNK: Curtain in two minutes!
UNK: SIGHS I can't get this bow straight.
Castle : Allow me, allow me.
Martha : Maybe I should have Alexis do it.
Martha : I mean, how many bows have you tied in your lifetime?
UNK: Well, I only tie my shoes every day.
Castle : If you remember, you taught me?
UNK: Yeah, yeah. True.
Castle : The bow.
Castle : The bow was tied incorrectly.
Martha : Well, I told you we should have had Alexis do it.
UNK: Not your bow. The other bow. The one on her costume.
Castle : We arrested the wrong man.
Charlotte : What? I don't understand. So you're saying Darren didn't do it?
Castle : Well, he's guilty of blackmail, but that's as far as it goes.
