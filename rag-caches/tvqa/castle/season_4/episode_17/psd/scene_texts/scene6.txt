UNK: Maybe something she said or did?
Leslie : There was something strange last week.
Noah : We were supposed to have lunch on Friday, but she didn't show.
Noah : She called later to say
Noah : she went to the art gallery for a last-minute emergency.
Ryan : Last Friday. Was your lunch at 1 : 00 p.m.?
UNK: Yeah. Yeah, it was. Why?
RYAN : Kristina lied to her husband
Beckett : about why she missed their lunch.
Ryan : She wasn't at the art gallery last Friday.
Ryan : They don't know where she was.
UNK: Okay, so both of our victims were unaccounted for
Beckett : at exactly the same time, shortly before they got killed.
Beckett : So where did they go?
UNK: Yeah, still working on it. Excuse me. Yeah, Ryan here.
Castle : Maybe they knew each other.
Beckett : No, their families said they didn't know each other.
Beckett : They had completely different careers
UNK: and they lived in different parts of town.
Beckett : It seems like their lives never really intersected.
Castle : Until they both died at the hand of the same killer.
Beckett : So, why these two women? And why fairytales?
