Beckett : Okay, I need you guys to take point on the interview.
Beckett : Find out what he knows about this
UNK: and let's see if Kristina was connected to the other victim.
Ryan : You know, if our killer is dressing his victims in these costumes,
Ryan : I bet we can ID the manufacturer
Ryan : and find out where he got them.
Beckett : That's a good idea. You run with it.
UNK: Ah. Here it is, "White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony."
Beckett : So, our victims aren't reenacting the fairytales.
Beckett : The killer is.
Lanie : Only this woman didn't die from a poisoned apple.
Lanie : She has the same injection marks as Amy Morgan.
Beckett : Do you have time of death?
UNK: Between 5 : 00 and 7 : 00 a.m. this morning.
Castle : So he kills Red Riding Hood,
UNK: then six hours later, he strikes again?
Castle : That's a pretty quick turnaround.
UNK: That's all the markings of a serial killer.
UNK: Yeah, but technically,
UNK: you have to murder three times to be a serial killer.
UNK: Yeah, let's make sure he never gets there.
ESPOSITO : When did you last see your wife, Mr. Curtis?
UNK: Just before 5 : 00 a.m. when she left for her jog.
UNK: Noah Curtis : She gave me a kiss goodbye. That was the last time I saw her.
