Charlotte : And Owen had scored some Special K.
Charlotte : That hit us pretty hard.
Charlotte : But Kristina had some of her mom's oxy
Charlotte : and said it would even us out.
Charlotte : Somehow we ended up in Amy's car
UNK: and that's where this picture was taken.
Beckett : How did Owen end up on the side of the road?
Charlotte : He was having some seriously bad hallucinations.
Charlotte : Just screaming and grabbing us.
Charlotte : So we pulled the car over and we made him get out.
Charlotte : We just figured he'd walk back to the rave.
Charlotte : But it was all over the news the next morning
UNK: that there'd been a hit-and-run and that he'd been killed.
