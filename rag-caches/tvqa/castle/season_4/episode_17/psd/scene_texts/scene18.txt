Charlotte : We paid.
Charlotte : So why did he come after us?
UNK: Okay, the corner of Bleecker and Thompson.
Beckett : There are no security cameras at the drop site,
Beckett : and so far no witnesses.
Castle : He covered his bases.
Beckett : I know, it's really starting to piss me off.
Castle : Yeah, and you get cute when you get angry.
Castle : But not when you get angry with me.
Esposito : Yo, so I took a look at Owen's family.
Esposito : I think I found someone with motive.
Esposito : Turns out he has an older brother,
Esposito : and apparently they were close.
Beckett : Any connection to our victims?
UNK: Oh, yeah. See for yourself.
Beckett : Wait, that's Leslie's husband, Darren.
Castle : So Owen's brother is married to our first victim's sister?
ESPOSITO : What are the odds, right?
Castle : Maybe Darren somehow found out that
Castle : his wife's sister was responsible for his brother Owen's death.
UNK: No, maybe the families just knew each other socially.
Beckett : It doesn't mean that Darren's our killer.
UNK: No, that doesn't, but this might.
Ryan : CSU tracked down where the photo was processed.
Ryan : It's from a roll of film,
Ryan : and the guy who dropped it off had three copies made.
