Leslie : Amy's single. She lives alone.
Leslie : She's very driven.
Leslie : Was, she was.
Beckett : Do either of you know why she would be wearing this?
Darren : What is it? A cape?
Castle : It's a Red Riding Hood cloak.
Darren : She was wearing that?
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Leslie : I know Amy's closet. This was not hers.
Leslie : I mean, even her sweatpants were Prada.
Beckett : Well, maybe she was going to a party. Did she mention any parties?
Leslie : I'm telling you, she would never wear a thing like this.
Beckett : Leslie, did your sister ever tell you
Beckett : about anything unusual going on at work
Beckett : or in her personal life?
Leslie : I don't know. I hadn't heard from her all week.
Beckett : And was that out of the ordinary?
Leslie : Yes. We usually talked every day and when she didn't call,
Leslie : I just assumed she was busy with a case or something.
UNK: But maybe there was something else going on.
BECKETT : Okay, bye.
UNK: Hey, thank you. So, that was Ryan.
Beckett : He just left animal control,
Beckett : and there was only one recent report
Beckett : of an animal loose in the park.
Beckett : A beagle named Fred.
Castle : Either Fred is one vicious beagle
Castle : or this mystery has just deepened.
Castle : How does a high-powered lawyer
Castle : end up dead in a Red Riding Hood costume?
Castle : Amy worked long hours, under high pressure, right?
Castle : What if she had a secret way of letting off steam
Castle : that even her sister didn't know about?
Beckett : Like what?
Castle : There's this whole adult role playing subculture
