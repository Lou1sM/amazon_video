Charlotte : Yeah, I mean, I guess so.
Charlotte : Though I'm pretty sure I told you everything I know.
Beckett : Well, last time we spoke, you said that everyone was in Amy's car?
UNK: Right.
Beckett : And who was driving?
Charlotte : She was. Why?
Castle : Well, we did a little checking.
Castle : The day after Owen died, Amy brought her car to a body shop.
Castle : She had a broken grill and a dented bumper.
Beckett : Any idea how she got those dents?
CASTLE : Charlotte, what really happened that night?
Castle : Did Owen try to get back into the car? Maybe Amy panicked?
Castle : Accidentally hitting him as she drove away?
UNK: Charlotte?
Charlotte : I begged Amy to go back.
Charlotte : Kristina and I both did. We begged her, but she just kept driving.
Charlotte : She didn't mean to hurt him. It was just an accident.
Charlotte : That's the truth. That's what really happened.
Darren : Is it?
Castle : Take a look
Castle : at how the bows are tied on the victims' costumes.
Charlotte : What about them?
Castle : Well, the killer tied these bows
Castle : after the victims were drugged.
Castle : See how they look? How the loops are pleasingly horizontal?
Castle : Now look at the bow on your Sleeping Beauty outfit.
Castle : See how the loops are vertical?
UNK: It's a little weird.
Castle : I mean, if the killer tied all three bows,
Castle : why would yours be different?
Beckett : It's because you tied all three bows.
