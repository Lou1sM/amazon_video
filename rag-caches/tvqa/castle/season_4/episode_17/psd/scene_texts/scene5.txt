UNK: Noah Curtis : I can't believe she's gone.
Ryan : Mr. Curtis, this run she took, who else knew she was going?
Noah : Other joggers in the park, I guess. She went every morning.
Noah : Even in the snow, she never missed a day.
Esposito : She have problems with any of the other joggers?
Noah : No. Not that she told me.
Ryan : Did she ever mention being followed or watched?
Noah : You're saying someone was stalking her?
Ryan : Under the circumstances, this doesn't look like a random attack.
Ryan : What did your wife do for a living?
Noah : She owned an art gallery on 5th Avenue.
UNK: It's family owned, she took it over from her dad.
Esposito : You ever see this woman before?
Esposito : Or heard the name Amy Morgan?
Noah : No, I don't think so. Why? Who is she?
ESPOSITO : She's another victim, Mr. Curtis.
Esposito : Could she be an acquaintance of Kristina's?
Noah : I don't recognize her. I'm sorry.
Ryan : Did you notice anything unusual
Ryan : about Kristina lately or her state of mind?
