Esposito : So we tracked it to the Lower East Side,
UNK: to a one-block radius somewhere along here.
UNK: All right, you stay on grid.
Beckett : Let us know if he moves. Esposito, you're coming with me.
Ryan : Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Ryan : You want to do this, you do it right.
Ryan : You put a team on that car,
Ryan : and you bring backup with you.
Beckett : Ryan, this whole thing started because of a group of corrupt cops.
Beckett : How do you know there aren't more out there?
Beckett : We're about an inch away from catching this guy,
UNK: and I'm not gonna blow it by advertising our next move.
Ryan : With all due respect, this guy put a bullet in your heart,
Ryan : and then he disappeared into the ether.
Ryan : You cannot go in there unprepared.
BECKETT : Unprepared?
Beckett : I've been preparing for this for the past 13 years.
Ryan : Hey, Javier.
Ryan : Man, don't let her do this. It's too big of a risk.
Esposito : It's all good, bro. We got this.
Castle : Come on. We don't want to miss her speech.
Castle : Or the entire graduation.
MARTHA : I'm almost ready.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGING
UNK: SIGHS
Esposito : Hey. We got him.
Esposito : The doorman at the residency hotel across the way ID'd the car.
Esposito : And the front desk clerk confirms
UNK: that Mr. Maddox is here on a one-month lease.
Esposito : They've agreed to let us in his room.
Esposito : Get out of the way.
UNK: Clear. Clear.
Esposito : Montgomery's files.
UNK: His contact list. What the hell are they looking for?
UNK: Not "what," who.
Beckett : They grabbed Montgomery's wedding album.
ESPOSITO : Why?
BECKETT : They're looking for someone that he knew.
Esposito : Maybe they found him.
Beckett : We gotta get out of here.
UNK: I'm gonna call for backup. We'll set up...
UNK: GRUNTS
