Beckett : Come on, come on.
UNK: Yes.
Beckett : So that's what you look like.
ESPOSITO : I'm gonna run this through Army CID.
Esposito : If they met in the military, someone in Orlando's old unit
Esposito : might be able to ID him. No.
Beckett : No, we don't know who's involved
Beckett : and we don't know how high this goes.
Beckett : The minute we put this photo out there, these people are gonna know.

Beckett : We have to do this one on our own.
RYAN : Beckett, that's impossible.
Ryan : All we have is a face. No name, no ID, no way to find this guy.
Beckett : Then we will find a way to find him. I'm not gonna lose this lead.
Ryan : How are we supposed to investigate if we can't investigate?
Esposito : You heard the lady. We find a way.

UNK: KNOCKING ON DOOR
UNK: Hey. Hey.
Beckett : I just got off the phone with Esposito.
UNK: Our killer had a key chain,
Beckett : and he matched it to Eastway Car Rentals.
Castle : That could be any one of a thousand cars.
Beckett : I know, it's a needle in a haystack, but at least it's a haystack,
Beckett : and they keep most of their licenses on file.
UNK: Kate... Yeah, he's probably using a fake ID,
Beckett : but we should be able to narrow it down from the...
UNK: Kate! What's wrong?
UNK: CLEARS THROAT
Castle : You have to stop.
Castle : This investigation, you have to stop.
Beckett : Castle, we already talked about this. I'm fine. I'm in control.
Castle : No, you're not.
Ryan : They are.
Castle : And if you don't stop, they will kill you, Kate.
Beckett : What are you talking about?
Castle : Before Montgomery went into that hangar,
