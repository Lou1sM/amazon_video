Beckett : He's off the team.
Beckett : So what do we got?
Esposito : Eastway rented 700 cars last Wednesday.
RYAN : We belie ve our suspect is
Ryan : going under the name Cole Maddox.
UNK: He rented it out of JFK.
ESPOSITO : It's a Kansas driver's license.
Esposito : Now, we did some digging. It's a cover ID.
Beckett : Did he return the car? No.
Esposito : But Eastway maintains GPS tracking on all of its equipment.
Esposito : So we tracked it to the Lower East Side,
UNK: to a one-block radius somewhere along here.
UNK: All right, you stay on grid.
Beckett : Let us know if he moves. Esposito, you're coming with me.
Ryan : Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Ryan : You want to do this, you do it right.
Ryan : You put a team on that car,
Ryan : and you bring backup with you.
Beckett : Ryan, this whole thing started because of a group of corrupt cops.
Beckett : How do you know there aren't more out there?
Beckett : We're about an inch away from catching this guy,
UNK: and I'm not gonna blow it by advertising our next move.
Ryan : With all due respect, this guy put a bullet in your heart,
Ryan : and then he disappeared into the ether.
