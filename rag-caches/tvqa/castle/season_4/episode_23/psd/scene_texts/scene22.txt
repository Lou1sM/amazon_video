Castle : That lie was the only thing that was protecting you.
Beckett : Castle, I didn't need protection, I needed a lead.
Beckett : And you sat on it for a year.
Beckett : Now, who is this person? How do I find him?
UNK: He's a voice on the phone. He's a shadow in a parking garage.
Beckett : You met with him?
Beckett : How do you know that he's not behind my mom's murder?
Beckett : How do you know that he's not involved?
Beckett : And how the hell could you do this?
