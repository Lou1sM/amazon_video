UNK: Marisol Cartagena : I woke up this morning and both him and my car were gone.
Beckett : Where did he go?
UNK: I figured he'd gone to the career center to check the job listings.
Marisol : He does that every morning.
Castle : He'd been looking for work? For months.
Marisol : Orlando served his country.
UNK: You'd think that'd mean something, but it's been tough.
Marisol : Especially after my hours got cut.
Beckett : So he was under financial pressure?
UNK: Is it possible that he went back to old habits?
UNK: No.
Beckett : Look, Marisol, we know that he ran with the Cazadores.
Beckett : Do you think that... I said no!
UNK: He went through hell to escape that life. It's why he enlisted.
Marisol : To get out. To be a better man for me.
UNK: A better father to our son.
