Diego : Said he had something big coming up,
Diego : something that would make him whole.
Beckett : Did he say what?
Diego : No. But that morning, my phone rings.
Beckett : And he said it'd all gone wrong.
Diego : He was desperate, talking about they were gonna kill him.
UNK: Who's "they"? Don't know.
Diego : But he was scared.
Beckett : Why did he call you?
Diego : Protection, chica.
UNK: He said if I help him out, he'd come back.
Diego : And he knew that was the price.
Diego : So I told him where to meet.
Diego : But by the time I got ther he was already dead.
