Beckett : And you told him where to meet?
Diego : That's right.
Beckett : You didn't tell anyone else? No.
Beckett : Did you see anything there?
UNK: White guy. Six foot.
Diego : Caught a glimpse before the night swallowed him whole.
UNK: They must've been tapping Orlando's phone.
Beckett : That's the only way they got there first.
Beckett : But how did they know to target Orlando for the job?
Castle : Because he was desperate for money.
Beckett : Yeah, but how did they know that?
Beckett : How did they know his background?
Esposito : Because they knew him from the military.
Esposito : He was hired by somebody he knew.
UNK: It's a place to start.
Castle : But whoever's gotten close to that secret is dead.
Castle : I think it's clear we're in over our heads here.
Esposito : Speak for yourself, bro.
Ryan : Orlando's financials just came in.
Ryan : He was underwater and overdrawn,
Ryan : until last week when a wire transfer for 10 grand hit his account.
