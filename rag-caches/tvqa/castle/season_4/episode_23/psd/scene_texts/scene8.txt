Esposito : We ran it against Vincente. It's not a match.
Esposito : In fact, it wasn't a match to anyone in the system.
Ryan : But it did match DNA trace evidence found at another crime scene.
Castle : Well, at least that's something. What was the crime scene?
Esposito : It was a shooting.
Ryan : Beckett, it was your shooting.
Esposito : DNA confirms that the man who killed Orlando Costas in that alley
Esposito : is the same man who put a bullet in your heart.
Beckett : No leads for 11 months, and now this.
Beckett : Does Gates know?
UNK: No.
BECKETT : Then we don't tell her.
Beckett : If she finds out this is a match to my shooting,
Beckett : she'll take me off the case.
Castle : Maybe you should be off this case.
Castle : They tried to kill you once, Kate.
Castle : You keep going on this, they...
Beckett : What's to stop them from trying again?
Beckett : What's to stop them now?
Beckett : No. I've been waiting a year for this.
Beckett : And I'll be damned if I let someone else screw it up.
Ryan : Hey, Javier.
Ryan : Man, this just feels wrong. We need to tell Gates.
Esposito : Why? So she can send Beckett home?
UNK: You think that's gonna work? You think that's gonna stop her?
UNK: She's gonna investigate this case, Kevin, whether she's on it or not.
UNK: The least we can do is make sure that we have her back.
