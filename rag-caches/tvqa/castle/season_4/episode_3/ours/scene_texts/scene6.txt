UNK: It was inside his briefcas and that's why you killed him, isn't it?
Eddie : Killed him? No, no, I asked him to change my grade.
Esposito : Excuse me?
UNK: I met this girl, Suzy, at the beginning of the semester.
UNK: I've never been in love before, but I fell hard, man.
Eddie : When I wasn't with her, all I could do was daydream about her, you know?
ESPOSITO : What the hell are you talking about?
Esposito : What does your love life have to do with any of this?
UNK: 'Cause of Suzy, I didn't study for Professor Hamilton's midterm.
Eddie : I got an F. We don't get Fs in my family.
Eddie : Especially in bio. My father would kill me.
UNK: So I broke into Hamilton's office
Eddie : and tried to change the grade in his computer,
Eddie : but I didn't know his password.
Eddie : I got frustrated and threw it against the wall.
Ryan : Don't you lie to me, Peck.
Ryan : Hamilton's grade report sa you got an A on his midterm.
UNK: That's 'cause after class the next day, I followed him,
UNK: tried to work up the courage to beg him to change my grade.
Eddie : But before I could, we were in this scary neighborhood,
Eddie : and he went into this seedy hotel.
Esposito : And what was he doing there? I don't know.
UNK: But he came out an hour later, and when he saw me, he totally wigged,
Eddie : like eyes popping out of his head, crazy.
Eddie : He offered to change my F to an A,
Eddie : in exchange for me never telling anyone he was there.
