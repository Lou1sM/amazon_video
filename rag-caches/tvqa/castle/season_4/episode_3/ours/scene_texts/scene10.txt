Beckett : He was at a department breakfast the morning that Hamilton was killed.
Beckett : I mean, we caught the guy with our victim's head.
Castle : 99 times out of 100,
Castle : you catch someone with a guy's head, he killed the guy.
Beckett : Yeah, well, Boyd also provided the MRIs of Hamilton's head.

Castle : So in an odd way, he got lucky.
Beckett : How so?
Castle : Well, Dr. Weiss said that cryonics was all about preserving the brain.

UNK: "One lifetime together wasn't enough."
Beckett : That's our motive.
