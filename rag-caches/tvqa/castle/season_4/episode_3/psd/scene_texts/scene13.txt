Beckett : A brain tumor?
UNK: Inoperable. Untreatable.
Boyd : He only had a few months to live.
Beckett : Well, then, why did he go to you? Why didn't he go to a hospital?
Body : Because as a scientist, he knew the limits of current therapy.
Body : And he was familiar with my work, nanoparticle genetic therapy.
UNK: English.
Boyd : Targeted treatment of tumors.
Boyd : I'm years away from human testing,
UNK: but he was my best friend.
Boyd : How could I say no to him?
Beckett : So you set up shop at the hotel to keep it secret?
