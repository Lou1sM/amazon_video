Castle : Who would sign up for an illegal experimentation
Castle : of an untested surgical procedure?
Gates : I don't know. If it could make you feel better,
UNK: live longer, hell, I'd give it a try.
Martha : Though not in a sleazy hotel. I need five stars.
UNK: Hmm.
Castle : Any sign of Alexis this morning?
UNK: Oh. No.
Castle : When I got home last night, she was sacked out on the couch.
Castle : I had to carry her up to bed. That's the first time in years.
Martha : Poor baby, she hasn't been herself since getting that rejection.
Castle : Hey, sweetheart. What's in the box?
Alexis : My life of lies.
Alexis : I'm throwing it all out.
Castle : Honey, all your awards? You worked hard for these.
Alexis : Did I? Half of them are participation trophies.
Castle : Super pee-wee soccer. You remember the time...
UNK: LAUGHS
Castle : You scored a goal off your head and you didn't even realize it?
Alexis : And I got a trophy for that?
Alexis : We didn't even win a single game.
UNK: Come on, you weren't supposed to keep score.
Beckett : Yeah, well, Stanford keeps score.
UNK: Hey, come on, Alexis. Some of these awards a re for actual achievements.
UNK: "Franklin Middle School spelling bee champ,
UNK: "Marlowe Prep French Award?"
Alexis : The one I wanted was Stanford!
Castle : Sweetheart, I know Ashley is going to Stanford...
Alexis : This has nothing to do with Ashley. It's me, Dad. I'm a failure.
Castle : Hey, just because you didn't get into one school
Castle : does not make you a failure.
UNK: But you are gonna have to accept that you didn't get in and move on.
UNK: How?
