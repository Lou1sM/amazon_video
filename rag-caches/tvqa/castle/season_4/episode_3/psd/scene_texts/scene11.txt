Weiss : Oh, my God. What is it?
Weiss : It's gone.
Weiss : The thermal storage unit should be right there.
Lanie : You gotta be kidding me.
Beckett : Are you saying you lost his head?
UNK: Cynthia Harrison : I don't understand. How does my husband's head just go missing?
Ryan : That's what we're trying to figure out, Mrs. Hamilton.
Ryan : Do you have any idea who could have operated on him
UNK: at the Hundred and Thirtieth Street Inn?
Cynthia : I already told Detective Beckett,
Gates : I don't know anything about that.
Cynthia : Now, I need to find him immediately.
Cynthia : I need to make sure that his wishes are being respected.
Ryan : I understand, and I promise you
Ryan : that we are doing everything that we possibly can.
Cynthia : What about Dr. Weiss? He's in charge over there.
Cynthia : Have you spoken to him?
Beckett : Detective Beckett is with him right now.
Weiss : I'm just as concerned about Hamilton's head as you are, Detective.
Weiss : There must have been a break-in at our storage facility.
UNK: A break-in? Really? Is that what you're going with?
Weiss : We've never had anything like this happen to one of our clients.
Weiss : It's the only thing that makes any sense.
Beckett : No, I will tell you what makes sense, Dr. Weiss.
Beckett : Either you're part of a cover-up or you're a murderer.
Beckett : Or both.
UNK: What? Why would I kill anyone? I have a family.
Beckett : Well, then, did you take them into consideration
Beckett : when you colluded in moving a body from a murder scene?
UNK: That was a one-in-a-million circumstance,
Weiss : and everyone ended up getting what they needed.
UNK: Then why is it at every step of this investigation,
