Cynthia : Our eternity together.
Cynthia : It's what we always dreamed of.
Castle : So, Detective, would you consider this to be a crime of passion?
Beckett : I would consider this a crime of love.
UNK: Nice.
Castle : Though that would depend on whether Cynthia Hamilton
Castle : was in love or insane.
Beckett : Well, sometimes there's a fine line between the two.
Beckett : Dr. Weiss, I have your release forms ready to go.
Weiss : I'm grateful, Detective. Castle.
UNK: So, I just need you to sign down there at the bottom,
Beckett : and the charges against you and your employees at Passageway
Beckett : will officially be dropped by the department.
Weiss : I'm happy to put this behind us.
UNK: RAPID BEEPING
Esposito : Excuse me. Yeah.
Weiss : It's a biowatch signal. A client has just flatlined.
Weiss : Well, that's strange.
Beckett : What is it? The signal.
Weiss : It's coming from inside this building.
Castle : The ring on her right hand.
UNK: It's a cyanide pill.
WEISS : Detective Beckett.
Weiss : Permission to have my technicians come and get her?
Beckett : Yes, of course.
Castle : Wouldn't it be something if they reunited 100,
Castle : even 1,000 years from now?
Beckett : Well, anything's possible.
Castle : You really believe that?
Beckett : It's what the great love stories are about, right?
Beckett : Beating the odds?
Castle : I hope they make it.
Beckett : Me, too.
