Beckett : You mean, there's no body?
Lanie : Nope, just lots of blood.
UNK: Whose ever it is, there's no way they survived.
CASTLE : Well, where did they go?
Lanie : You're the one with all the crazy theories, Castle.
Castle : Walking dead.
Lanie : But there are indications that the body was moved.
RYAN : I think I know who moved it.
UNK: I got witnesses that said they saw an unmarked white van
UNK: Kevin Ryan : fleeing the scene just after 7 : 00 a.m.
UNK: Did they get an eye on who was behind the wheel?
UNK: No, but we got unis canvassing for eyewitnesses
UNK: and checking every street-level security cam in a five-block radius.
BECKETT : Tire tracks.
Beckett : Get a cast of the tire treads.
Beckett : CSU might be able to get make and model.
UNK: There's two different size footprints. There was at least two of them.
Beckett : Yeah, but there's no tread on the footprints.
UNK: They must have been wearing booties.
Castle : Missing body, killers who literally cover their tracks.
Castle : Anyone else getting a quick-strike assassin squad vibe?
UNK: Come on, Castle, you're not saying this was some kind of black ops job?
Castle : I'm not saying it. The evidence is saying it.
Castle : I'm betting this guy's buried at sea by now.
BECKETT : Lanie, there's an imprint in the blood.
Lanie : Yeah, it looks like a box or a case.
UNK: It might have been our victim's.
Castle : Nuclear launch codes, probably.
Beckett : Hey, Ryan, there's a pattern. Let's see if CSU can ID it.
UNK: Ugh!
Beckett : Is there a problem?
Ryan : No, sorry, it's just that word, "pattern."
