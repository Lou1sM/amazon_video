Malik : Why did you plant that bomb?
UNK: Hey. No luck with those witness statements. You guys catch a break?
Esposito : Better yet, we caught the suspect.
Castle : And I missed it? Where is he?
Esposito : In the box. With Beckett.
Beckett : Would you like me to refresh your memory?
Beckett : So you admit to having it.
UNK: No. That's not what I meant.
Beckett : You just said that it wasn't yours.
Bobby : Yeah, because you got me all confused...
Beckett : Did you or didn't you have it? It's a simple question.
Bobby : I don't know.
Beckett : Who put you up to this, Bobby? Who gave you that backpack?
UNK: I don't... I don't know. I don't remember!
Beckett : You don't remember. How do you not remember?
Bobby : I was in shock. The bomb went off, everyone was running and screaming.
UNK: It must've been one of those traumatic amnesia things.
UNK: Bobby! Don't lie to me.
Bobby : I'm telling you, it was all a big blank. It was the trauma.
Beckett : It was not the trauma. You don't get to use that excuse.
Bobby : I swear! I don't remember.
Beckett : The hell you don't remember!
Beckett : And I remember every second of it.
Beckett : And so do you.
Castle : All this time.
