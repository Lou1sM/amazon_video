NADIA : Damn it!
Castle : You're certain the man you saw leaving the backpack
UNK: I gave the wrong answer?
Beckett : Are you sure this wasn't the person?
Malik : No. It's not him.
UNK: The FBI has got the wrong guy.
Castle : Which means the real bomber is still out there.
UNK: Agent Johnson : If Andrew Haynes didn't plant the bomb,
UNK: Agent Johnson : then why did he email those threats?
UNK: Agent Johnson : Why does his GPS show him fleeing the scene?
Gates : We can't answer that yet. But our witness gave a good description.
Beckett : It was this man.
UNK: Agent Johnson : How do we know this guy's not making this up?
Beckett : Look, the details of the bomb haven't been released to the press yet.
Beckett : So how would our witness know about the blue backpack
Beckett : unless he actually saw it?
UNK: Agent Johnson : All right, you people pursue this. See where it leads.
UNK: Agent Johnson : But Andrew Haynes is still our prime suspect.
UNK: Agent Johnson : At least until you can get me something
UNK: Agent Johnson : more than the word of a street musician.
Gates : Identifying this man, that is now our top priority.
Gates : According to our witness, he was wearing a TakeOver! sweatshirt,
Gates : so he might be part of the movement.
Gates : Show the sketch around, talk to other protesters.
Gates : If he was a regular in Boylan Plaza,
UNK: someone there must know who he is.
