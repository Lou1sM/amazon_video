Beckett : The man who said that you took his backpack,
Beckett : is that him?
UNK: Yeah, that's the guy.
CASTLE : Are you sure?
UNK: He's one of the victims.
Beckett : And he's a member of the movement.
Castle : Doesn't make any sense. Why would he attack his own people?
BECKETT : Okay, thank you.
Beckett : So unis searched Jesse Friedman's place.
Beckett : And they found research on how to build the same device
Beckett : that was used in Boylan Plaza.
Castle : So Jesse blew up his own protest? Why would he do that?
UNK: Maybe to get sympathy for his movement? Publicity...
UNK: And since he placed the bomb between two dumpsters...
UNK: He didn't think that anyone would get hurt.
Beckett : Then Bobby stole the backpack.
Castle : If Jesse was worried about someone getting hurt,
Castle : why would he set off the bomb?
Esposito : I don't think he did.
UNK: There was no remote found on or near the body.
Esposito : Which means someone else detonated it.
RYAN : Probably somebody he knew.
UNK: Thirty seconds before the blast,
Ryan : Jesse got a call on his cell from a burner phone.
UNK: Then two seconds before the bomb went off,
Ryan : he tried to call that same phone back.
BECKETT : So, then, maybe Jesse had a partner. And that's who triggered the bomb.
