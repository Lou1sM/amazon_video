Alexis : I'm doing something important. Valuable.
Alexis : I mean, isn't that why you do it?
Castle : You're a pretty smart kid, you know that?
Alexis : Well, they say genius
Alexis : skips a generation.
UNK: Apparently, so does funny.
Alexis : Eat your pancake.
Mark : All right.
RYAN : Beckett.
Castle : What's going on?
UNK: Nothing. I'm just thinking about my next move.
Ryan : I may have it for you. We got a line on this guy.
Beckett : Someone ID'd the sketch?
UNK: Yeah. A protestor named Jenni Klein.
Ryan : Says she knows this guy as Bobby.
Beckett : And there's no last name?
Ryan : No, but this Bobby invited her over once. She knows where he lives.
Esposito : Hey, Bobby.
Esposito : Remove the backpack and place it on the ground, slowly!
Ryan : Then get on your knees!
Ryan : Just a bunch of gym clothes and some water bottles.
Esposito : Not like last time, huh, Bobby?
UNK: Get up.
Beckett : That's your name, right, Bobby?
Beckett : Actually, I know quite a bit about you.
Beckett : I know where you live. I know you don't have a record.
Beckett : I know you're not a member of any political party.
Beckett : And as soon as my team finishes searching your place,
UNK: I'm gonna know even more.
Beckett : Eventually I'll find out. But why don't you just tell me.
