UNK: The guy's still not talking?
UNK: SIGHS Not yet. I'm gonna let him sweat for a bit.
Beckett : Was Castle here?
Esposito : Yeah. Earlier. But he said he had to go.
Esposito : Said there was somewhere he needed to be.
Martha : Richard, really? A bomb memorial?
UNK: Come on, honey, isn't this kind of morbid?
