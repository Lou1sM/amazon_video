Leann : Hundreds have gathered here and in other cities across the country
UNK: CROWD SCREAMING
Beckett : Thank you.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : You're welcome.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : So how's our girl doing?
Castle : She's upstairs, in bed, asleep.
Castle : Wish I could keep her in there.
Martha : Honey, do you ever wonder why I never visited you at the precinct
Martha : the first year you were working there?
Castle : I always thought it was because of the harsh lighting.
UNK: LAUGHS
Beckett : Well, that was a consideration.
UNK: No, I thought if I saw you acting like a cop,
Martha : I'd start thinking of you as a cop.
Val : And I just...
Martha : That brought on all manner of nightmares.
Castle : How did you get over it?
Martha : Eventually you realize
UNK: your children are gonna make choices you don't like.
Martha : Just a fact of life.
Castle : Well, if the bombing proves anything,
Castle : it's that bad things can happen no matter what you do.
Martha : Nobody's tomorrow is guaranteed.
UNK: So, how do you plan to act on this realization?
Gates : What do you mean?
Martha : Oh, you know what I mean.
Martha : Richard, how much longer are you gonna drag your heels
Martha : before you tell Beckett how you feel?
Martha : And I mean while she is awake,
Martha : not lying on the ground with a bullet in her chest.
Castle : You don't understand...
UNK: It is complicated. So you say.
Martha : Only it's not.
Martha : It's not.
Martha : Nobody's tomorrows are guaranteed, right?
Martha : Wouldn't it be better to tell her even if the timing is wrong
Martha : than never to tell her at all?
Castle : And what if she isn't ready?
