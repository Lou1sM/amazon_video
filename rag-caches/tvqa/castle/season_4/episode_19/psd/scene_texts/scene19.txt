Beckett : You wanted to get promoted to the anchor desk.
Castle : So you set up your camera at the perfect vantage point.
Beckett : You waited until you went live, and you detonated that bomb.
Leann : What? That is insane.
Leann : This is ridiculous.
Leann : And I will not listen to another word of it. We're done here.
BECKETT : Do you recognize that?
Beckett : That's the burner cell that you used to call Jesse.
CASTLE : Found it in a storm drain about two blocks from Boylan Plaza.
Castle : You know what else we found in there?
Castle : The remote you used to detonate the bomb.
Beckett : Small enough to hide in the palm of your hand.
Beckett : It's got your fingerprints all over it, Leann.
Leann : How did you find that?
Castle : By tracking your movements after the explosion using your phone's GPS.
Leann : No one was supposed to get hurt.
UNK: It was just gonna make a lot of noise.
Leann : And people would start respecting me as a reporter.
Leann : But everything just went wrong.
UNK: Why didn't you come forward once you realized what you had done?
LEANN : I thought about it. But what good would that do?
Leann : I kept quiet for Jesse.
Leann : I wanted to protect his memory.
Castle : Well, that's what your friend Jesse would call sinning by silence.
