Beckett : Makes you think about all those things in your own life
Beckett : that you don't want to put off anymore.
ESPOSITO : Yo.
Esposito : Captain's gathering the troops.
Gates : Now that it appears that this attack
Gates : was not directed at any specific individual,
UNK: we've got a new assignment from the FBI.
Gates : We all know where the bomb went off.
UNK: It was here, right next to this lamppost.
Gates : The FBI just recovered this photo from a protester's cell phone.
Gates : It's of the same location, taken 47 seconds
Gates : before the explosion.
Gates : That could only mean one thing.
Gates : The bomb was placed here by someone within our 47-second time period.
UNK: Our task is to interview all witnesses
Gates : who were present at Boylan Plaza.
Gates : We are looking for anyone
Gates : who saw what went on by this lamppost before the blast.
Beckett : Sir, there are over 300 names on this list.
Beckett : How do you recommend that we proceed?
Gates : We bring in more shifts.
Gates : Someone on that list
Gates : saw the bomb being planted within our 47-second window.
Gates : We find that person, we find the bomber.
Beckett : Thank you for your time.
UNK: Well, that was unhelpful.
Castle : Yeah. I'm starting to sense a pattern.
UNK: This next woman says that she was in the middle of the whole thing.
Corinne : We were right here. It's like the bomb went off right next to us.
UNK: Who's "we"? Me and my sister, Nadia.
Corinne : She's out there right now, waiting. Should I go get her?
Beckett : No. Actually it's better if we just talk one on one.
