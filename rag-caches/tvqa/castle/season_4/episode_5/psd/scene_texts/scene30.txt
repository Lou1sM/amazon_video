UNK: He saw me with the Fistin my hands. What was I supposed to do?
Beckett : You know what's ironic?
Beckett : Your husband would have let you have the Fist.
Beckett : He didn't even want it.
Beckett : The DA said that her husband called several times,
Beckett : begging to testify against her.
Serena : When can I collect the Fist?
Ryan : The insurance company's asking.
Beckett : Well, it's in evidence.
Beckett : Once the case is resolved, they'll release it.
Serena : I want to thank you.
Serena : I couldn't have done this without you. I'm really grateful.
UNK: So does that mean you're cutting me in on the finder's fee?
Serena : I'm not that grateful.
Serena : Well, I...
Beckett : I think we all ended up with what we wanted.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : You know, after you and Castle went on that date...
Serena : More like a sting.
Beckett : He never thought that you were involved.
Beckett : He believed in you, even when I didn't.
Serena : Why are you telling me this?
Beckett : It's just... I think that you should know
Beckett : what kind of person you're dealing with.
Castle : Here we are, ladies.
Castle : Thank you. Thank you.
Castle : Anything wrong?
Beckett : No, I should...
UNK: I'm just gonna go and file some stuff.
UNK: And I'm going back to my hotel.
Serena : I would ask you to come, but it's like I said,
Serena : I don't steal things that belong to someone else.
UNK: SIGHS
Beckett : You guys didn't go out?
UNK: No.
UNK: Why?
Castle : Because I can't afford it.
Castle : The museum just slapped me with a bill for that exhib I broke.
UNK: Whoa!
Castle : I know! You'd think they'd cut me some slack
UNK: after the whole "helping to solve the murder" thing.
UNK: I guess the least the NYPD can do is take you out for a hamburger.
Castle : I accept.
Beckett : Let's go.
Castle : I could put Alexis through college on this.
Beckett : Yeah, and med school.
Castle : Thank God I'm rich.
