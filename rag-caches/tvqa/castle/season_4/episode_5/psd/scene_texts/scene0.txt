UNK: Darling... One second.
UNK: Richard Castle : I'm just about to toss a g off the Brooklyn Bridge.
Martha : Oh, I am sure that
Martha : Carter Damien would appreciate a short reprieve.
Castle : Too late. He just went kersplat.
Castle : Now, how can I help you?
Martha : I've invited my acting class to come here Friday night
Martha : to do the Nora scenes from A Doll's House.
Castle : Thank you for the warning. I will make myself scarce.
Martha : No, no, no. No, no, darling,
Martha : this class could really benefit
Martha : from your perspective as a writer.
Martha : No, you definitely should be here.
Castle : Mother, what's going on?
Martha : There's a lovely girl in the class, and I just thought maybe...
Castle : Oh, Mother, you're not trying to fix me up again?
Castle : Haven't you learned your lesson after the last fiasco?
UNK: Fiasco? You married her.
Castle : Yes, and how did that marriage end?
Martha : Honey, I am just trying to help you.
Martha : You have to admit that your social life has been a bit anemic as of late.
Castle : Now I want to throw myself off the Brooklyn Bridge.
Martha : Darling, all you have been doing for the last few months
Martha : is writing and working with Beckett.
Martha : Now, I think a fix-up is in order.
UNK: Unless...
UNK: Unless?
Martha : You have some reason for not putting yourself out there.
UNK: MOBILE PHONE RINGING
UNK: Kate Beckett : Getting ready for your close-up, Castle?
Castle : No, just trying to discern the hidden meaning.
Castle : Is it about the rise of technology? Rampant narcissism?
Castle : Or did someone just ha ve a lot of extra TVs?
UNK: Yeah, well, sometimes you don't need to know what it's about.
UNK: Sometimes it's just art.
Castle : Why, Detective Beckett, how very existential of you.
Castle : Let me guess. Art Theory in college?
