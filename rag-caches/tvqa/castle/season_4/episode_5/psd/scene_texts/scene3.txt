Serena : Plus, the bay was full of catering vans.
UNK: He could've had one waiting for him, and just blended right in.
Castle : Oh, she's good.
Beckett : At theory, but what about proof?
Serena : I don't need proof to know that I'm right. It's my job.
Serena : And I can help you with yours.
Beckett : How so?
Serena : I get a 1% finder's fee for recovering stolen objects.
Serena : I want that Fist, you want your murderer.

Serena : I could consult on your case and share my insight.
Beckett : You know, that is an intriguing idea.
Beckett : No, thank you. That won't be necessary.
UNK: Well, can't blame a girl for trying.

UNK: Really?
Castle : And what if she's on to something?
