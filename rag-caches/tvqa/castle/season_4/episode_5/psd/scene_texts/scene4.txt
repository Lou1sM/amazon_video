UNK: check and see if all of the catering vans are accounted for,
Beckett : and interview all the catering staff,
Beckett : see if anyone saw anything unusual in the loading bay.
Castle : Now, was that so hard?

Castle : We don't know why, but he goes to check on it

Beckett : The Fist, sitting there, undisturbed in the gallery.

Beckett : and rigged a pre-recorded loop.
Beckett : There's no prints, but CSU did find what they think is hair gel.
