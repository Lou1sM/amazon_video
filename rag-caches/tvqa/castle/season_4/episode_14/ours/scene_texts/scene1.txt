UNK: Florence/martha : Damn it, Mr. Flynn!
UNK: Florence/martha : Why have an apartment
UNK: Florence/martha : when you drink yourself to sleep in the office every night?
UNK: Joe/castle : That way I'm never late for work. Say, what gives anyhow?
UNK: Florence/martha : We have a potential client. So be nice.
UNK: Florence/martha : I'd like to make next month's rent if you don't mind.
Beckett : All right.
UNK: Joe/castle : How do I look?
UNK: Florence/martha : Like a star.
JOE : Just another day on the isle of Manhattan,
UNK: until she walked in with the case that changed my life.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : Wearing T-strap shoes and a country suit,
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : I could tell that redhead was a hick fresh off the cob.
UNK: Hello, my name is Sally Mulqueen... I mean, Scofield.
UNK: Sorry, I'm a newlywed and still getting used to the name.
UNK: Joe/castle : Joe Flynn, Mrs. Scofield.
UNK: Joe/castle : So, tell me, what has you knocking on my shingle?
UNK: Sally/alexis : I talked my husband into honeymooning up here in the Big Apple.
UNK: Sally/alexis : But not because I wanted to climb skyscrapers and see Broadway shows.
UNK: Sally/alexis : I had myself another reason.
UNK: Sally/alexis : See, I'm looking for my big sister, Vera. Vera Mulqueen.
UNK: Sally/alexis : There was bad blood back home,
UNK: Sally/alexis : and Vera ran off two years ago
UNK: Sally/alexis : with dreams of being a showgirl up here in the Big City.
UNK: Joe/castle : She send you a wire, postcard? Anything with a return address?
UNK: Sally/alexis : Can you find her, Mister?
UNK: Mama's sick and doesn't have long.
UNK: Florence/martha : Well, of course he can. For 15 bucks a day, plus expenses.
UNK: Only, can we keep this quiet?
UNK: Sally/alexis : Like I said, there's bad blood back home
UNK: Sally/alexis : and if Vera hears from a stranger that the family's looking for her,
UNK: Sally/alexis : it might push her farther away.
UNK: Joe/castle : Mrs. Scofield, if I'm anything, I'm discreet.
