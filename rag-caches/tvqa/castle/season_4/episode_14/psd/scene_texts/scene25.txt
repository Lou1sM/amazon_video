Beckett : Actually, we're here to investigate Stan Banks' murder.
Beckett : And we were wondering if you met him at Betsy Sinclair's funeral?
UNK: Yeah. He was murdered?
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Jerry : Poor kid.
Beckett : Did he mention a necklace called the Blue Butterfly?
Jerry : Oh, sure. Asked me all kinds of questions.
Jerry : Where it might be, stuff like that.
Jerry : But I was just a bartender back then, I wasn't much help.
Castle : Now, this might seem an odd question,
Castle : but in 1947, do you remember when
Castle : Vera Mulqueen and Joe Flynn were murdered?
