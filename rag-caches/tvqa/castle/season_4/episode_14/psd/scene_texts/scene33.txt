Beckett : Why would I do that? Sounds like self-defense.
Beckett : Besides, we're looking for a woman named Vera, not Viola.
UNK: And a PI named Joe, not a former bartender named Jerry.
Joe : We don't know how to thank you.
CASTLE : I do.
Castle : Answer two questions.
Castle : One, if you had the Blue Butterfly, why didn't you take it?
Castle : And two, where has it been all this time?
UNK: Well, we were home free till doll face here had herself an epiphany.
UNK: Vera/beckett : This thing really is cursed.
UNK: Joe/beckett : Vera, that's just fancy rocks on a pretty rope.
UNK: Vera/beckett : No, it's more than that. It's misery. Joe, we can't.
UNK: Joe/castle : I got no love for this thing. Just you.
UNK: Joe/castle : But I'll be damned if I let Dempsey get his hands back on it.
