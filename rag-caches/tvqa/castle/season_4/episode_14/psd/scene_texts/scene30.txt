Clyde : Took the Blue Butterfly for yourself?
Frankie : I brought their old .38 only as a precaution.
Frankie : I was just gonna chloroform Stan and steal it.
Beckett : But you found Clyde Belasco hiding behind the bar.
Frankie : I pulled the gun. Stan grabbed for it.
Frankie : I didn't mean to.
Beckett : Let's go, Frankie. You're under arrest.
Beckett : Hey, Castle, guess what we found at Frankie's apartment?
Castle : Oh, my! Oh, my God!
Castle : It's beautiful.
Beckett : It's fake. What?
Beckett : We confirmed it with an appraiser.
Beckett : It's well-crafted costume jewelry.
Beckett : All this time, and it's paste?
UNK: That's... Or maybe it's a twist on a twist?
Castle : Maybe the real Blue Butterfly was switched out for this one years ago.
Beckett : Well, whatever happened, it doesn't change the facts.
