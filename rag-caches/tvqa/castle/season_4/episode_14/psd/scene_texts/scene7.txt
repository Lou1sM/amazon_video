Joe : Know her? I'm looking at her.
UNK: And where have you been all my life?
JOE : What was I thinking? This dame was trouble on two legs.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : I kept telling myself to look away.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : She was with Tom Dempsey, for crying out loud.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : The most ruthless mob boss New York has ever given birth to.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : Dempsey sent over two of his gorillas, an Irishman and a Cuban,
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : on loan from some Havana mob family.
UNK: Our boss wants to see you, boyo.
UNK: Joe/castle : Sorry, boys. My dance card's full.
UNK: Cuchillo/esposito : This isn't a request, compadre.
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: LAUGHS
UNK: Tom Dempsey : You know who I am?
UNK: Joe/castle : The waiter? I'll take a whiskey. The boys here can share a sloe gin fizz.
UNK: Moxie/ryan : You better watch yourself there, boyo.
UNK: Hold your tongue, or I'll cut it out.
Dempsey : A wise guy.
UNK: GROANS
UNK: I hate wise guys about as much as I hate crumbs eyeballing my girl.
