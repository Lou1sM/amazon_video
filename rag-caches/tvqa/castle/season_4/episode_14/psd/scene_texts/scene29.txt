Castle : What's Satchmo 's real name?
Castle : Louis Armstrong.
Castle : Put it all together, the answer's clear.
UNK: KNOCKING ON DOOR
Viola : Oh. Hello, again.
Beckett : Hello, Vera.
Castle : And hello, Joe.
UNK: Well, if it isn't Vera Mulqueen and Joe Flynn.
Castle : Back from the dead.
UNK: Everything all right, guys?
VERA : Everything's peachy. Thanks, Frankie.
Beckett : What happened? Stan figured out the truth?
Beckett : That you two were alive.
Beckett : That you murdered two people
Beckett : so you could disappear with the Blue Butterfly?
Beckett : So you lured him to the club and then you shot him?
Jerry : Lady, you got it all wrong.
Jerry : Stan cornered me at Betsy's funeral.
Jerry : Wanted to know how I knew her, so I lied. Told him I was the bartender.
Viola : Stan was clever. He was too clever. He figured us out.
Viola : He came here demanding to know where the Blue Butterfly was.
Viola : He threatened to expose us.
JOE : Like a dog after a bone.
Jerry : So we told him what he needed to know.
Jerry : We told him where it was. But we didn't kill him.
UNK: Come on, you guys. We know it's you.
Castle : You used the same gun from the '47 murders to kill Stan.
Castle : Same gun? But we keep that gun in...
UNK: In the china cabinet drawer.
Beckett : Don't even think about it. Put the gun down.
Viola : Francis Benjamin Huntsacker, what have you done?
Castle : Wait a minute, Huntsacker?
Castle : It was your mother who sold the diary to Stan.
Jerry : What diary? Your diary.
Beckett : So you read it and all this time you were looking for the necklace, too.
Frankie : That's why I got this crap job.
UNK: And for six months I slowly built trust, gently acquired information.
UNK: And then that jerk just waltzes in here
Frankie : and bullies the location of the Blue Butterfly from you? Come on!
Jerry : So when you realized it was now or never, you bushwhacked Stan.
