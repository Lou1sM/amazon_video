CASTLE : Talk about a slice of history.
Castle : The Pennybaker Club!
Castle : You know, back in the '40s all the greats played here.
Castle : If these walls could talk, man, the stories they would tell.
Beckett : Yeah, but the only story we need to hear is about...
UNK: Lanie Parish : Stan Banks. Single GSW to the sternum.
UNK: Lanie Parish : I'm calling the time of death between 6 : 00 and 8 : 00 this morning.
UNK: Lanie Parish : Looks like he tried to defend himself with this. Obviously, it didn't work.
UNK: So a robbery gone wrong?
UNK: Well, he still had his wallet, cell and a room key from the Parksville Arms.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : Pockets were pulled out, indicating the killer searched the body.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : For what? We have no idea.
Beckett : That's weird. He's got an SRO key,
UNK: but his driver's licen se has him livingon 34th Street.
Ryan : We'll hit the SRO. See if there's anything we can find out about him.
UNK: Thanks.
Beckett : You're looking for a drink, Castle?
Beckett : 'Cause I'm pretty sure the bar is closed.
Castle : Actually, I was looking for a clue. I think I've found one.
Castle : Some homeless guy's squat. And today's ledger.
Castle : He was here this morning.
Beckett : Well, whoever he is, maybe he saw something.
Beckett : I'll get patrol units to canvass the area.
Manager : Stan's dead?
Manager : Well, that's just great. What am I supposed to do with all his crap?
UNK: We'll be taking some of it off your hands as part of our investigation.
