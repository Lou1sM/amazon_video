UNK: All we got to do is take it away with us.
UNK: Joe/castle : What are you, daffy?
UNK: Joe/castle : You got at least two Brunos with you
UNK: Joe/castle : at all times when you' re wearing that thing.
UNK: Vera/beckett : It's funny.
UNK: Vera/beckett : Back when I was a cigarette girl, I'd watch Dempsey coming in
UNK: Vera/beckett : with his girlfriend wearing this thing
UNK: Vera/beckett : around her neck and I wanted it.
UNK: Vera/beckett : Pretty soon, I was his girl, and I had it.
UNK: Vera/beckett : But it's not a necklace, Joe. It's a diamond noose.
UNK: Vera/beckett : It's getting harder to breathe.
UNK: Then we got to turn that noose into a lifeline. Question is, how?
