Beckett : Looks like Stan was disappointed.
Castle : Yeah, he probably would have bee if that was the secret safe.
Beckett : That's not the secret safe?
Castle : Here's a fun fact, people often kept two safes.

Castle : And a second safe, that was much harder to locate,
UNK: for the extra-specials like Blue Butterflies.
Beckett : Castle, where's the secret safe?
Castle : Coming to that.
