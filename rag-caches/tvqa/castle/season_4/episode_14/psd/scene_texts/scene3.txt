JOE : June 18, 1947.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : The day began like every other,
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : pulling awake in my office chair,
UNK: with a Cream of Kentucky bottle,
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : a dry throat and a head that was ringing like church bells.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : So I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone,
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : with a little hair of the dog that bit me.
UNK: Florence/martha : Damn it, Mr. Flynn!
UNK: Florence/martha : Why have an apartment
UNK: Florence/martha : when you drink yourself to sleep in the office every night?
UNK: Joe/castle : That way I'm never late for work. Say, what gives anyhow?
UNK: Florence/martha : We have a potential client. So be nice.
UNK: Florence/martha : I'd like to make next month's rent if you don't mind.
Beckett : All right.
UNK: Joe/castle : How do I look?
UNK: Florence/martha : Like a star.
JOE : Just another day on the isle of Manhattan,
UNK: until she walked in with the case that changed my life.
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : Wearing T-strap shoes and a country suit,
UNK: Joe/castle voiceover : I could tell that redhead was a hick fresh off the cob.
UNK: Hello, my name is Sally Mulqueen... I mean, Scofield.
UNK: Sorry, I'm a newlywed and still getting used to the name.
UNK: Joe/castle : Joe Flynn, Mrs. Scofield.
UNK: Joe/castle : So, tell me, what has you knocking on my shingle?
UNK: Sally/alexis : I talked my husband into honeymooning up here in the Big Apple.
UNK: Sally/alexis : But not because I wanted to climb skyscrapers and see Broadway shows.
