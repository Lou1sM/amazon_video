UNK: Joe/castle : where I'll be waiting for you.
UNK: Vera/beckett : Joe, it's perfect.
UNK: Florence/martha : No! It's crazy.
UNK: What are you thinking, Mr. Flynn?
UNK: Florence/martha : And I can tell you, this Jane's no good.
UNK: Joe/castle : What are you on about?
UNK: Joe/castle : Look at me. I'm a new man. I'm a better man.
UNK: Joe/castle : I haven't even had a drink since I met Vera.

UNK: Florence/martha : A robbery and a lie?
