UNK: Alexis Castle : Dad! What are you doing?
UNK: Richard Castle : You have 30 seconds to suit up.
UNK: The game is afoot!
UNK: Dad... Wait.
Castle : Let me savor this.
Castle : Haven't got the drop on you since you were 10.
Castle : This feels like
UNK: victory.
Alexis : Dad, look, I can't, okay? I have a big decision to make.
Castle : Well, have you at least narrowed it down?
Alexis : I made a list of all the classes and the extracurriculars
Alexis : and the best choices seem to be Oxford and Stanford.
Castle : What about Columbi a, NYU, Vassar?
Alexis : They're all too close.
Alexis : I'd come home all the time. I want to challenge myself.
Alexis : And I'd get sucked into things like this.
Castle : But then who's gonna play with me?
Alexis : I think it's time to holster the laser guns and be adults.
UNK: ELECTRONIC BEEPING
UNK: COMPUTER VOICE : Game over. Please proceed to exit.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Oh, darling, it's just a game.
Castle : No, it's not.
UNK: It's a time-honored family tradition that we've been honoring
Castle : since Alexis could wrap her little finger around a trigger.
UNK: First one to 1,000 points wins. And we were so close.
UNK: We laser-tagged our way through her pre-teen years
Castle : and now suddenly she's too old to play.
Martha : She's growing up.
Castle : Well, she doesn't have to. Look at me.
UNK: CELL PHONE VIBRATING
UNK: Oh! Well, it seems Detective Beckett is available for a play date.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Beckett and I have not been exactly hitting it off lately.
UNK: Ah.
Martha : And why do you think that is?
Castle : I'm sorry, are you saying it's my fault?
Martha : Cavorting with some awful Gang detective,
Martha : showing up at a crime scene with a stewardess.
UNK: If you wanna punish Beckett, at least let her know why.
Castle : I'm not punishing her.
UNK: I'm... STUTTERING
Castle : Am I?
Martha : Darling, you're hurt. I understand that.
Martha : But quite honestly, the two of you cannot go on like this.
Castle : You know what, Mother? You're absolutely right.
Martha : Where are you going?
Castle : To a crime scene. SIGHS
UNK: To work my last case with Detective Beckett.
BECKETT : You said you didn't like coffee.
ESPOSITO : I like vanilla lattes.
Castle : Hey, guys. Hey.
Castle : Thanks for calling.
UNK: Sure.
Esposito : So our victim is David Lock, 29.
UNK: He was a currency trader at a foreign exchange office upstairs.
Esposito : Looks like he was heading into work when it happened.
Esposito : His body was found by his boss at around 7 : 00 this morning.
UNK: Oh, our intrepid heroes have arrived.
Perlmutter : And Castle.
Castle : Ah! Perlmutter, I will treasure these special moments we've shared.
UNK: So I take it that this is Mr. Lock?
PERLMUTTER : It appears he was set upon by an unknown assailant.
Perlmutter : Time of death was about 4 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : Cause of death?
