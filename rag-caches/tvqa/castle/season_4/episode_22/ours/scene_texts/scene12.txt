UNK: GROWLING
Esposito : Stop it!
Kyle : Don't do that. You're creeping me out.
UNK: GROWLING QUIETLY
UNK: Yeah, you really nailed it, Kyle.
Castle : Your costume is what sold that bit.
Beckett : Yeah, and by helping us, you've actually helped yourself.
UNK: The DA is looking into dismissing the charges against you
Beckett : now that he has Tom's confession.
Kyle : Detective, Mr. Castle, I don't know how to thank you.
UNK: Uh...
Castle : Let me borrow the zombie outfit
Castle : for another day, we'll call it even.
Kyle : You know what? Keep it.
Castle : You know, my zombie walking days are over.
Kyle : I just want to put all this behind me.
UNK: CASTLE EXHALES
Castle : How does somebody put something like that behind them?
UNK: He's gonna need therapy.
Beckett : It helps.
Beckett : First, he won't even be able to deal with it.
UNK: It's gonna take everything that he's got
Beckett : to just put one foot in front of the other and get through the day.
Castle : I didn't know you were seeing a therapist.
Beckett : Yeah, well, I didn't wanna make any excuses.
Beckett : I just wanted to put in the time and do the work.
Beckett : But I think I'm almost where I want to be now.
Castle : And where is that?
Beckett : In a place where I can finally accept
Beckett : everything that happened that day.
UNK: Everything.
UNK: I think I understand.
UNK: And that wall that I was telling you about?
Alexis : I think it's coming down.
Castle : Well, I'd like to be there when it does.
Beckett : Yeah, I'd like you to be there, too.
Castle : Only, without the zombie makeup.
UNK: I don't know, I think that the zombie makeup suits you, Castle.
Castle : Yeah, I make it work.
UNK: BECKETT LAUGHS
UNK: Tomorrow?
UNK: Tomorrow.
UNK: SCREECHING SCREAMING
UNK: LASER GUN FIRING GASPS
Castle : Victory is mine.
Castle : One thousand points!
Castle : And that is the icing on the cake that has been my day.
Alexis : That's it?
Alexis : It's over?
UNK: LAUGHING What? Come on. Alexis, it's just a game.
UNK: A game we started when I was five. And it's over.
Alexis : And I'm going to graduate, leave for college
Alexis : and I'll be there and you'll be here,
UNK: and we'll play at Christmas and during the summer,
Alexis : but it won't be the same, will it?
UNK: No.
Castle : But you know what? Things change.
Castle : And change is good.
Alexis : I can't do it.
Perlmutter : Do what?
Alexis : Go that far away.
Alexis : I want to go away, but not that far.
Alexis : And I hate myself for it because my personal motto is,
UNK: "Do the thing that you fear the most,"
Alexis : but every time I get ready to hit the "send" button
Alexis : on my acceptance to Oxford or Stanford,
Alexis : I get all sick inside.
UNK: Well, you follow your heart.
Castle : Follow your heart, you can't go wrong.
Alexis : And my heart is telling me,
UNK: "Go to Columbia."
Alexis : But here's the other thing.
Alexis : If I do this, you have to promise not to drop in on me.
Alexis : If I do this, you have to give me my space.
Martha : Do you think you can do that?
Castle : I think I can give a sincere
UNK: and solemn oath to try.
UNK: Then... ELECTRONIC BEEPING
Alexis : Best two out of three!
Castle : This isn't over.
UNK: DISTORTED VOICE This isn't over.
UNK: GROWLING
