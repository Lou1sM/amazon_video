Martha : But quite honestly, the two of you cannot go on like this.
Castle : You know what, Mother? You're absolutely right.
Martha : Where are you going?
Castle : To a crime scene. SIGHS
UNK: To work my last case with Detective Beckett.
BECKETT : You said you didn't like coffee.
ESPOSITO : I like vanilla lattes.
Castle : Hey, guys. Hey.
Castle : Thanks for calling.
UNK: Sure.
Esposito : So our victim is David Lock, 29.
UNK: He was a currency trader at a foreign exchange office upstairs.
Esposito : Looks like he was heading into work when it happened.
Esposito : His body was found by his boss at around 7 : 00 this morning.
UNK: Oh, our intrepid heroes have arrived.
Perlmutter : And Castle.
Castle : Ah! Perlmutter, I will treasure these special moments we've shared.
UNK: So I take it that this is Mr. Lock?
PERLMUTTER : It appears he was set upon by an unknown assailant.
Perlmutter : Time of death was about 4 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : Cause of death?
Perlmutter : Probably blunt force trauma to the head, where it hit the concrete.
Beckett : Wallet and cash?
Esposito : Still intact, so it definitely wasn't a mugging.
UNK: Savage beating at 4 : 00 a.m. There must be some motive.
BECKETT : Is this a bite mark on his arm?
Castle : It's not just a bite mark.
Perlmutter : Look at the skin. You see how it's torn?
Perlmutter : The killer latched on and shook
UNK: like a pit bull, trying to tear off the flesh.
UNK: Thanks, think we got it.
Beckett : Anything else?
Esposito : Just this. It was found in our victim's hand.
Esposito : It was probably torn off the killer's shirt during the struggle.
UNK: That's a lace cuff, hand-stitched, pearl buttons,
Castle : I'd say this w as circa 1870.
Castle : I did a lot of research on the era.
