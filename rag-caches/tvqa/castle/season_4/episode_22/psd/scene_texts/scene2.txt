UNK: COMPUTER VOICE : Game over. Please proceed to exit.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Oh, darling, it's just a game.
Castle : No, it's not.
UNK: It's a time-honored family tradition that we've been honoring
Castle : since Alexis could wrap her little finger around a trigger.
UNK: First one to 1,000 points wins. And we were so close.
UNK: We laser-tagged our way through her pre-teen years
Castle : and now suddenly she's too old to play.
Martha : She's growing up.
Castle : Well, she doesn't have to. Look at me.
UNK: CELL PHONE VIBRATING
UNK: Oh! Well, it seems Detective Beckett is available for a play date.
UNK: Really?
UNK: Beckett and I have not been exactly hitting it off lately.
UNK: Ah.
Martha : And why do you think that is?
Castle : I'm sorry, are you saying it's my fault?
Martha : Cavorting with some awful Gang detective,
Martha : showing up at a crime scene with a stewardess.
UNK: If you wanna punish Beckett, at least let her know why.
Castle : I'm not punishing her.
UNK: I'm... STUTTERING
Castle : Am I?
Martha : Darling, you're hurt. I understand that.
