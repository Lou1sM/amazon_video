Charlie : It was a zombie.
Charlie : A zombie?
COLEMAN : ON RECORDING It was a zombie. A freaking zombie!
UNK: 911 OPERATOR : ON RECORDING Sir, can you repeat that, please?
COLEMAN : A zombie. The undead.
UNK: Man, with those dead eyes and flaps
UNK: of rotting skin coming off its face.
UNK: 911 OPERATOR : Sir, this is for emergencies only.
UNK: Are you having an emergency?
COLEMAN : Yes! I'm having a major
UNK: emergency here! Don't you get it?
UNK: This thing just killed someone and it bit me!
UNK: I'm gonna turn! I'm next!
UNK: RECORDING STOPS
Castle : Now, Charlie made this 911 call moments after the attack.
Castle : Does it sound like he's faking to you?
Beckett : It sounds like Charlie's having a psychotic break.
Beckett : What if his guilt made him snap
Beckett : and he created a fantasy in which
Beckett : zombies killed David and not him?
Castle : I'm not so sure.
Castle : I mean, his voice does have that
Castle : authentic ring of pants-wetting terror.
Beckett : You do not believe in Charlie's story.
Castle : I believe he believes it.
Beckett : Okay, well, whatever you believe,
UNK: all of the evidence points to the fact
Beckett : that Charlie Coleman is our killer.
Epsosito : Maybe not all the evidence.
Epsosito : CSU analyzed that bite mark on Charlie's arm.
UNK: Turns out that it matches the bite mark on our victim.
Beckett : Maybe Charlie bit David and then he bit himself?
UNK: Well, I was thinking the same thing, but CSU also says
Esposito : that the bite marks weren't made by Charlie's teeth.
CASTLE : Oh, wait, um...
UNK: Sorry. Let me make sure I understand
UNK: so that I might properly relish this moment.
Castle : You're saying the evidence shows that Charlie and the victim
Castle : both were bitten by an as yet unknown third party?
