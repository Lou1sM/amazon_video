UNK: Next thing I know, I woke up in the morgue.
Beckett : Did you drink or do drugs that night?
Kyle : I don't do that stuff.
Kyle : Look, I didn't hurt anyone, okay? I would never do that.
UNK: I just... I don't remember anything.
Beckett : Well, the victim's blood was found on your clothes.
Beckett : Bite marks match your teeth.
Beckett : The cuff of your shirt was clutched in his hand.
Beckett : And a security camera caught our killer on tape.
Beckett : Is that you, Kyle?
UNK: Yes. That's me.
Beckett : I think you're gonna need a lawyer.
UNK: BREATHING DEEPLY
Castle : So Kyle killed someone he never met for no reason.
Castle : Is that what we're supposed to believe?
Beckett : Well, isn't that what you said zombies do?
UNK: It is with a sad heart I say that that man is no zombie.
Beckett : Even though he rose from the dead?
Castle : It's common knowledge when you turn into a zombie,
Castle : you cannot turn back.
Beckett : So you concede to the fact that there's
Beckett : a medical explanation to all of this.
Castle : I concede to nothing.
Castle : Except that Kyle is not telling us the whole story.
Beckett : You think he remembers?
UNK: When a life-altering moment occurs, people remember.
