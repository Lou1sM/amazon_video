BECKETT : We're gonna need to talk to him anyway.
Mike : That's strange. His car is right there next to David's.
Castle : Why is that strange?
Mike : Because Charlie never came into the office this morning.
Beckett : What's his address?
Castle : Well, that's a shame. This case had some real promise.
Castle : Savage bite marks? Reconstruction era clothing?
Castle : It's a mystery here. A whiff of intrigue.
Castle : Now we're just slapping cuffs on some disgruntled employee.
Castle : Just wanted this one to be special.
Beckett : Yeah, well, I'm sorry it's not entertaining enough for you, Castle.
Beckett : Charlie Coleman, NYPD. Open up.
COLEMAN : Stay away! It isn't safe!
Beckett : Stand back.
Charlie : It's for your own good! Don't come in!
Charlie : You can't come in here! CASTLE : Sorry, Charlie.
BECKETT : Charlie, you okay? Anyone here?
UNK: No, no, no, no. Get back! Get away from me!
UNK: Listen, we just got to ask you a few questions.
Charlie : You need to leave, you need to leave right now!
Charlie : It's not safe!
Castle : Relax, Charlie, relax. We're cops.
Charlie : You're a cop? Yeah.
Charlie : Is that your gun?
UNK: Yeah.
Charlie : You need to shoot me. Do it now!
Charlie : Do it! Do it!
UNK: Good, Charlie? You feeling better?
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Just got to ask you a few questions
Beckett : about what happened this morning with you and David.
Beckett : Did you see him in the parking structure?
UNK: Yeah, he'd just pulled in.
Charlie : I said hello, he said hello. The two of us aren't real friendly.
Castle : So we've heard. What happened next?
Charlie : And then he stopped.
Charlie : And he stared right past me with this weird look on his face.
UNK: And then he said, "What the hell is that?"
Charlie : What the hell was it?
UNK: I couldn't tell at first 'cause suddenly it was all over us.
Beckett : Wait, you were attacked, too?
Charlie : Yeah, but it was mostly after David.
Charlie : I mean, it was just wailing on him.
Charlie : I elbowed it in the head and it didn't even slow down.
UNK: Okay, what do you mean by "it"? I called 911, I told them.
Charlie : They didn't believe me, no one believes me!
Beckett : Just tell us what you saw.
Charlie : As long as you promise you'll believe me.
Beckett : Yeah, fine, I promise.
Charlie : Promise that you will use your gun on me when I start to turn.
UNK: "Turn"? What do you mean, "Turn"?
Charlie : The thing that bit me, that killed David?
