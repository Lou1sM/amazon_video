Castle : I was writing a book. A comedy about the Civil War.
Castle : Turns out, not so funny.
Perlmutter : You don't say.
Esposito : Who would beat a guy to death wearing a 150-year-old shirt?
Castle : You know, the bigger question is,
Beckett : why was he attacked here, where he worked?
UNK: You might wanna ask his boss. Mike Matthews.
UNK: Mike Matthews : I can't believe it.
Beckett : We think that David was killed around 4 : 00 a.m.
Beckett : Do you have any idea why he was here so early?
Mike : David handled the Asian markets, so he usually got in by 4 : 00.
Mike : He was a terrific kid. He was hard-working, well-liked.
Beckett : And was that the consensus?
Mike : What do you mean?
Beckett : I mean, did he have any conflicts with anyone at work?
Mike : Actually, yeah, there was an incident last week.
Mike : Someone keyed his car. Who?
Mike : David thought it was Charlie Coleman, one of my other traders.
Mike : The two of them were vying for a promotion and I went with David.
Mike : Charlie didn't take it too well.
Beckett : What time does Charlie usually show up for work?
UNK: 4 : 00 a.m., same time as David.
Mike : Look, Charlie's kind of an oddball,
UNK: but I don't see him mixed up in this.
