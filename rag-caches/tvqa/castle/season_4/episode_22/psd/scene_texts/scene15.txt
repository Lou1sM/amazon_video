Beckett : Well, maybe it's too big to deal with. Maybe he
Beckett : can't face it just yet.
Martha : Do you think he ever will be?
UNK: Hopefully. If he feels safe.
UNK: Perlmutter!
Beckett : What are you doing here?
Perlmutter : I came to tend to one of my patients, Kyle Jennings.
UNK: Uh...
Martha : Do you think that's such a good idea?
UNK: I'll have you know I am perfectly capable of treating living patients.
Perlmutter : I simply prefer not to.
UNK: I've made an exception here
Perlmutter : because the results of his blood work are quite unusual.
Mike : What do you mean?
Perlmutter : Kyle Jennings had scopolamine in his system,
Perlmutter : which, in small doses, is used to treat motion sickness.
Perlmutter : In larger doses, it acts on the central nervous system
Perlmutter : to promote compliant and suggestible behavior.
Castle : Exactly how suggestible?
Perlmutter : You'll basically do whatever you're told.
Perlmutter : It's like a date rape drug, only the victim remains conscious.
Perlmutter : And when the drug wears off,
UNK: they have no recollection of what happened.
Castle : Is it possible somebody slipped Kyle that drug?
Perlmutter : I think it's highly probable that they did.
BECKETT : What time do you think he was given the scopolamine?
UNK: Between 2 : 45 and 3 : 45 the night of the murder.
Beckett : That's when he was on that zombie walk.
UNK: Someone on the zombie walk drugged Kyle and sent him after David.
Castle : Kyle's innocent.
