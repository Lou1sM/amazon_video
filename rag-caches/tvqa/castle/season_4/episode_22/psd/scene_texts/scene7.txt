Esposito : That's what I just said. Perhaps even
Castle : a mindless,
UNK: shuffling, undead third party?
Beckett : Castle, just stop. There's no such thing as a zombie.
RYAN : Guys.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : You gotta see this.
Ryan : So I was combing through security cam
Ryan : footage near the parking garage,
Ryan : and I found this.
UNK: Time stamp's 4 : 06 a.m., which fits time of death. That's our guy.
Castle : Yeah, but it's not Charlie.
BECKETT : Wait, what is he wearing?
Beckett : That looks like an old-fashioned suit.
Castle : Circa 1870,
Castle : and his shirt's missing a cuff.
UNK: Whoa! He almost got hit by that taxi. Didn't even flinch.
Ryan : Well, maybe this is why. Look what we get from the other angle.
Castle : My friends,
Castle : that is a zombie.
Castle : Our killer's a zombie!
Martha : You're rather upbeat,
Martha : considering you said this wa your last case with Beckett.
Castle : That's because I am going out with a bang.
Castle : I have one word for you, Mother.
UNK: Zombie.
Martha : Too much makeup? You look lovely.
Castle : I'm referring to our victim being killed by one of the walking undead.
Castle : And I mean that literally. A zombie.
Castle : Security camera caught him in all his putrefying glory.
UNK: Whoo.
Martha : I don't suppose you downloaded this video, by chance?
Castle : Absolutely not. That video is police property.
Castle : It would be very, very wrong of me
UNK: to get a screen grab of it and email it to myself.
UNK: Well, it'll be our little secret, darling.
UNK: I'm actually surprised at your interest in this case, Mother.
Martha : Well, I really do know the difference
UNK: between a first-rate makeup job and actual decay.
UNK: You wanna see some real zombies,
