Beckett : Yeah, he lives four blocks away from the crime scene,
UNK: and CSU's going through his apartment right now, to find
Beckett : evidence to link him to the murder.
Gates : Tie this up in a bow, Detective. Get me a confession.
UNK: Take a seat, Mr. Hockney.
Chad : Look, this is just a big misunderstanding.
UNK: I mean, I'm on your guys' side here.
Beckett : Our side doesn't execute criminals.
UNK: See? Yeah, neither do I.
Castle : Except for last night's episode of Two Half-Men.
Beckett : We have a witness, Chad. She saw you kill Tyler Faris.
Castle : And then like a moth to a flame,
Castle : you were inexorably drawn back to the scene of the crime.
UNK: Which is when you realized you lost part of your suit.
Beckett : So you came back to get it Or, rather, take it from us.
Castle : This is all about your father, isn't it?
Castle : You're driven by his death.
UNK: My father's in Miami.
Chad : I don't know what you people are talking about.
Beckett : So you're saying you weren't in the alley,
Beckett : slapping my hand with your sword, and you didn't kill Tyler Faris?
Chad : No! I would never kill anyone.
UNK: I mean, neither would Lone Vengeance.
Beckett : Aren't you Lone Vengeance?
Chad : Not the real one.
Castle : The real one being the comic book character?
Chad : Comic book characters aren't real, okay?
Chad : I mean the guy who assumed the persona of the comic book character.
UNK: And who is that?
UNK: No one knows. But he is a legend in the superhero community.
Chad : I dreamed of being him when I was Red Marune.
UNK: "Protector of all, beholden to none"?
Chad : You've heard of me?
Beckett : We saw the purse-snatching video.
Chad : Yeah. That. Ugh.
Chad : That hit the web and pretty much turned Red Marune into a joke.
