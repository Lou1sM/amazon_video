Paul : Can I write my confession now? Is that okay?
Ryan : Are you sure he didn't do it?
UNK: Yeah, Faris' hand was chopped off before he was killed.
Beckett : Paul didn't know that.
Beckett : Then why did he confess?
Castle : Because Paul is protecting the real killer.
Castle : Paul is the writer. Lone Vengeance is the subject.
Castle : That's their relationship. It's you and me, all over again.
Castle : But I'm Paul, and you're Lone Vengeance.
Beckett : Really, Castle? Is that how you see me, like a sword-wielding killer?
