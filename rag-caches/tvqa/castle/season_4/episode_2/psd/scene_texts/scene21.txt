Gates : Of police officers.
Gates : Team of police officers, Mr. Castle.
UNK: Detective, about Officer Hastings,
Gates : she fled the alley when you ordered her to stop.
Gates : Some reason you're not pressing any charges?
UNK: I...
Gates : Think that given the number of folks wearing that costume,
UNK: we can't prove that it was her in the alley.
Gates : Or anywhere else, for that matter.
Beckett : Exactly, sir.
GATES : She's a promising officer.
Gates : That said, it'd be bad for all of us
Gates : if Lone Vengeance were to show up ever again.
Beckett : I don't think that that will be a problem, sir.
Gates : Well, let's make sure it isn't.
Castle : Either she just grew a heart...
Beckett : Or she's worried about how it would look
Beckett : if the press found out that Lone Vengeance was one of our own.
UNK: ELEVATOR DINGS
Castle : A writer and his muse, fighting crime.
Castle : Just like us Mmm..
Castle : So, tomorrow?
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
Castle : Ah! Ah!
Castle : Oh, hello, Mother.
UNK: Ah, Falstaff.
Martha : Really? It's King Lear. Oh.
UNK: Ugh!
Martha : I have work to do.
Castle : Hey. What's up?
UNK: Uh, Skyping with Ashley. But we just finished.
Beckett : You know,
Castle : even when you were a little girl,
Martha : you were a serious person.
Castle : I think I've just gotten used to you being sensible and mature.
Castle : Even more than me sometimes.
UNK: Sometimes?
UNK: Point taken. The thing is, Alexis, I know there are other sides to you.
Castle : Impulsive sides,
Castle : romantic sides.
Castle : And I don't want you to deny them.
Beckett : You were right.
Alexis : With great power does come great responsibility.
