Esposito : The time code lines up with the night that Valtini said he was attacked.
RYAN : And according to E.R. records,
UNK: he was admitted that night with knife wounds to the buttocks.
Esposito : The sword of justice, bro.
UNK: SIGHS
UNK: Wait, is that...
CASTLE : No.
Esposito : It can't be.
Lanie : It is.
Castle : Our killer is a superhero!
Gates : Really? A superhero?
Beckett : Yeah, our witness from the alley confirms
Beckett : that she saw this man kill Tyler Faris.
Gates : Why didn't she say that before?
Beckett : She didn't think that we'd believe her.
Beckett : And quite frankly, she's right.
Gates : A masked vigilante on the loose, hacking people up.
Gates : Tell me what your plan is to apprehend this individual.
Beckett : We're looking for murders with the same M.O.
Beckett : We're also checking into enemies
Beckett : that Tyler Faris and Tony Valtini might have had in common.
Beckett : And finally, we're trying to track down where that suit and sword came from.
Gates : Reach out to Bellevue. They probably admitted our suspect before.
