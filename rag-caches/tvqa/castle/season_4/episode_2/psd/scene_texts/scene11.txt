UNK: KNOCKING ON DOOR
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY Hey.
Castle : I should have called.
Beckett : Yoga, Castle. I was doing yoga.
UNK: Come on in. Gotcha.
Castle : I found something that will shock and amaze you.
Castle : I downloaded all of the Sword of Lone Vengeances.
UNK: That's not shocking or amazing.
Castle : You didn't let me finish.
Castle : I was looking for clues as to the killer's identity in the comic books.
Castle : I didn't find any. But check out what I did find.
Castle : Take a look at these panels.
UNK: A hoodlum leaves his warehouse.
Castle : Lone Vengeance swoops in,
Castle : and then carves the letter "L" in his right cheek.
Castle : Who does that remind you of?
Ryan : Tony the Butcher.
Castle : I checked the dates on the issue,
Castle : it came out after Lone Vengeance attacked him.
Castle : These panels emulate that event.
UNK: The only other person who was there was our vigilante.
Beckett : So then, you're saying that.. It has to be..
Castle : Our killer is the writer of this comic book. Sean Elt.
BECKETT : Okay, thank you.
Beckett : Sean Elt doesn't exist. His name is an alias.
Castle : Or a nom de plume, as we writers say.
Castle : Though why anyone would choose Sean Elt...
Castle : Wait a minute.
Castle : It's an anagram.
Castle : Change the letters around and you get...
Beckett : Stan Lee. Comic book genius.
Castle : Trust me, he is no Stan Lee. He's not even Sean Elt.
RYAN : Yeah, all right. Thanks, Bill, maybe next time.
Ryan : So, no help from Tech on the real name.
Ryan : The Lone Vengeance website is registered solely to Sean Elt.
Esposito : Well, whoever he is, he put more than Tony the Butcher in his comics.
