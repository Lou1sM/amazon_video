Beckett : Gotta call in an APB.
UNK: RINGING
Beckett : Espo, I gotta call you back.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, wait, you're gonna want to hear this.
Beckett : Yeah, we just saw our suspect. He fled the crime scene.
Esposito : Yeah, and I know where to find him because I know who he is.
Beckett : What? How?
Esposito : Well, he bought a samurai sword at a pawnshop today.
Esposito : And now get this, he paid for it with a check.
Esposito : His name is Chad Hockney.
UNK: And his photo matches the mystery man from the crime scene.
Beckett : What's his address?
UNK: NYPD! Do not move a muscle.
Castle : Unless you can move faster than a speeding bullet.
Beckett : This man?
Gates : He's our killer?
Castle : Well, to be fair, he was a lot more imposing in a dark alley.
Castle : With a sword. Uh-huh.
