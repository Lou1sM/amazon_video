Castle : You heard?
Castle : You don't remember me tackling you?
Beckett : No, I don't remember much of anything.
Beckett : I remember that I was on the podium,
UNK: and then I remember everything just going black.
Castle : You don't remember
UNK: the gunshot?
UNK: No.
UNK: They say that there are some things that are better not being remembered.
UNK: Yeah.
Beckett : I keep seeing his face, Castle.
Beckett : Every time I close my eyes,
Beckett : I see Montgomery lying on the hangar floor.
UNK: You should've let me go in there.
Castle : They would have killed you.
Beckett : You don't know that.
UNK: Kate...
Beckett : Castle, I'm really tired right now.
Castle : Of course.
Castle : Of course. We'll talk tomorrow.
Beckett : Do you mind if we don't?
Beckett : I just need a little bit of time.
Castle : Sure, sure. How much time?
Beckett : I'll call you, okay?
UNK: Sure.
