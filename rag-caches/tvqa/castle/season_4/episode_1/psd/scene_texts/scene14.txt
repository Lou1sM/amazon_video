Castle : It's just another dead end.
UNK: How'd it happen?
Castle : It was an accident. It was old wiring.
Castle : Are you sure?
Castle : Yeah, there was an investigation.
Beckett : Well, did you see the report from the fire investigator?
UNK: No.
UNK: But, really, a warehouse fire?
Castle : Seems an awful lot of trouble just for a couple of files.
Beckett : That's no more trouble than they've already gone through.
Beckett : I mean, we have to read that report.
UNK: It's just there's this one problem.
UNK: What?
UNK: How are you gonna help if Gates kicked you out?
