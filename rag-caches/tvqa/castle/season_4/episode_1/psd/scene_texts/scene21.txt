Esposito : Since it's a high-profile case,
UNK: Beckett wants to make sure that we don't make any mistakes.
Gates : Well, that's good to hear,
Gates : 'cause we wouldn't want her making any mistakes, now, would we?
ROD : Warehouse in Union City.
Lanie : Yeah, yeah, I remember this fire.
UNK: The report said it was an accident.
Dale : Yeah, that's right.
Beckett : And you're sure?
Halstead : Yeah, I'm sure.
Castle : And this report hasn't been altered in any way since you filed it?
Halstead : No, why?
Beckett : Mr. Halstead, this is very important.
Beckett : Was there anything that you didn't put in that report?
UNK: Javier Esposito : What do you mean?
Beckett : Anything that might indicate suspicious activity?
Halstead : If there was anything suspicious, Detective, it'd be in the report.
Halstead : Power surge to the junction box. One-in-a-million event.
UNK: Thanks.
Beckett : So at no point did anyone pressure you
UNK: into keeping some information out of that report?
Halstead : You are way out of line here. I'm out of line?
UNK: I'm not the one who falsified that report.
Halstead : Get out of my station.
Beckett : Who set that fire? Who had you cover it up?
Gates : Get out! Okay.
Beckett : You tell them that I'm coming after them!
UNK: And you tell them that I'll find them!
Martha : What the hell are you doing?
Beckett : He's lying.
Beckett : You don't know that.
Beckett : Yes, I do.
Beckett : Esposito. I need you to get me everything you can on Rod Halstead.
Beckett : Yeah, and send it to my apartment.
Beckett : I don't need Gates looking over my shoulder.
UNK: You got it. That was Beckett.
