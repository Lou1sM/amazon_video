Beckett : Yeah, well, I didn't have any leads then.
Castle : We don't have any now.
Beckett : Look, Castle, I got a little emotional last night.
Beckett : I'm fine.
Castle : No, you're not.
Castle : And you know you're not.
Castle : You've been back here three days, you're already in a free fall.
Castle : I'm not telling you to walk away, I'm just saying give it time.
