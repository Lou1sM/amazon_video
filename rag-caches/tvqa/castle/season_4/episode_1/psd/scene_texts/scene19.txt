Esposito : Sit your ass down in that chair.
RYAN : Why don't we start with why you ran?
UNK: Or maybe why you were pointing a gun at a police officer?
Ryan : You want to talk about it?
Beckett : About what?
Castle : Kate, I saw you. When you saw that gun, you froze.
Beckett : It's nothing.
Castle : Your hand was shaking. That's not nothing.
Beckett : Castle, it's my second day back. That's all. It's no big deal.
Castle : And if it happens again?
Beckett : It won't.
Castle : Where are you going?
Beckett : Find out who burned down that warehouse.
Castle : Find out who killed my mom.
UNK: Come on, Dale. We know you killed her.
Esposito : Just tell us why and we'll tell the DA that you cooperated.
UNK: The gun's a match, Dale.
Beckett : I told you, it's not mine!
UNK: Then why were you holding it?
UNK: We have witnesses who saw you enter her apartment and then leave.
Dale : Yeah, that's right. I was there, okay, and then...
UNK: STAMMERING Look, man, I don't know.
Dale : I crashed, and when I woke up, there was all this blood.
Dale : And this was in my hand.
Ryan : So what are you saying, Dale?
UNK: You sleep-shot her? SCOFF Is that your defense?
Dale : SIGHS No. Look, I'm saying it wasn't me.
Esposito : So, you went to bed and you slept through your girlfriend's murder.
