ESPOSITO : We did get DNA off the weapon,
Espostio : but there were no matches in the system.
Espostio : We flagged it, though.
UNK: But didn't Castle tell you about all this?
UNK: No.
Esposito : That's weird. Why wouldn't he...
Esposito : Why would he hide that from you?
UNK: He's not hiding anything. I just haven't seen him in a while.
UNK: How long is a while?
Beckett : Pretty much since the shooting.
Ryan : Why? What happened?
Beckett : Nothing happened. I just needed some time.
ESPOSITO : What, he left you alone for three months?
Beckett : You guys, it wasn't his fault. I told him that I would call.
Esposito : Why didn't you?
Esposito : He was here with us every day working the case.
Esposito : For months.
Esposito : He'd still be here if the new captain hadn't kicked him to the curb.
Beckett : She kicked him out. Why?
Ryan : Apparently, her precinct's got no room for a dilettante writer playing cop.
