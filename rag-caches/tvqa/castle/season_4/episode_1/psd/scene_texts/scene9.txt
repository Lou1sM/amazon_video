Ryan : Captain Victoria Gates, aka Iron Gates.
UNK: As by-the-book as they come.
Ryan : She cut her teeth as a detective with Internal Affairs.
Beckett : Wow, that's not going to win her any popularity points.
RYAN : Yeah, it's like she brought her distrust of cops along with her.
ESPOSITO : One thing's for sure, she's no Montgomery.
Ryan : Hey, if she hasn't talked to Castle, she doesn't know about the bank yet.
Beckett : What bank?
UNK: Well, we weren't getting any traction on the shooter,
Esposito : so Castle suggested we check out Montgomery, McCallister and Raglan.
Esposito : See who they might have been in business with back in the day.
RYAN : We know those guys were getting fat ransoming wise guys.
UNK: Maybe they used that stash to pay off the guy
UNK: who ordered yo ur mother's murder.
UNK: Yeah, so Castle thinks he's found the bank that they used.
UNK: So then there's a money trail.
RYAN : Only problem is the bank closed down.
Ryan : No one knows where those old records ended up.
Espostio : We were working to locate them
Espostio : when Iron Gates shut down the investigation.
Beckett : She shut the case down? Why?
Ryan : No new leads on the shooter,
Ryan : and we couldn't tell her the rest of it
Ryan : without implicating Captain Montgomery.
