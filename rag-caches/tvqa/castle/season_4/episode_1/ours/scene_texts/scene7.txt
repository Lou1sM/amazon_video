UNK: A beat cop ID'd Sonya Gilbert's boyfriend
Gates : heading into the band's rehearsal garage on the Lower East Side.
Gates : You, too, Beckett!
UNK: SOFTLY Hide this.
Esposito : Hey. You ready for this?
Beckett : You're kidding, right?
UNK: Okay. But we got point.
Beckett : Let's go.
MITCH : What the hell were you thinking coming here, Dale? Huh?
DALE : Please, bro. I just need some money...
UNK: NYPD!
Esposito : NYPD! Let me see your hands right now!
UNK: Let me see them. Show me! Down! Put them in the air!
UNK: Lay down on the ground! Stop!
Esposito : Get on the ground!
UNK: BREATHING HEAVILY
ESPOSITO : Drop it or I'll drop you!
RYAN : Drop it now! Down! Down! Down!
DALE : Okay, okay, okay.
ESPOSITO : Drop it on the ground! RYAN : Down, down, down!
UNK: The same caliber that killed Sonya Gilbert.
DALE : It's not my gun, man. I swear.
Dale : It's not my gun.
Esposito : Sit your ass down in that chair.
RYAN : Why don't we start with why you ran?
UNK: Or maybe why you were pointing a gun at a police officer?
Ryan : You want to talk about it?
Beckett : About what?
Castle : Kate, I saw you. When you saw that gun, you froze.
Beckett : It's nothing.
Castle : Your hand was shaking. That's not nothing.
Beckett : Castle, it's my second day back. That's all. It's no big deal.
Castle : And if it happens again?
Beckett : It won't.
Castle : Where are you going?
Beckett : Find out who burned down that warehouse.
Castle : Find out who killed my mom.
UNK: Come on, Dale. We know you killed her.
Esposito : Just tell us why and we'll tell the DA that you cooperated.
UNK: The gun's a match, Dale.
Beckett : I told you, it's not mine!
UNK: Then why were you holding it?
UNK: We have witnesses who saw you enter her apartment and then leave.
Dale : Yeah, that's right. I was there, okay, and then...
UNK: STAMMERING Look, man, I don't know.
Dale : I crashed, and when I woke up, there was all this blood.
Dale : And this was in my hand.
Ryan : So what are you saying, Dale?
UNK: You sleep-shot her? SCOFF Is that your defense?
Dale : SIGHS No. Look, I'm saying it wasn't me.
Esposito : So, you went to bed and you slept through your girlfriend's murder.
RYAN : Six shots.
Ryan : You must be a heavy sleeper.
Gates : Motive, opportunity, possession of the weapon.
Gates : Looks like a murder-one trifecta.
UNK: His bandmate, Mitch Yancey there,
Esposito : said he was looking for money to get out of town.
Gates : All right, contact the DA's office, have them file charges
Gates : and let the family know.
Gates : Yes, sir.
Gates : Where did Castle and Beckett go off to?
