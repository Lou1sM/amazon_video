UNK: No.
UNK: ALEXIS SIGHS
Alexis : But ask me again tomorrow.
Martha : Alexis, darling, help me with the Duck I'Orange, s'il vous plait.
CASTLE : Ah! Thank you.
Castle : And I didn't get a chance to properly thank you for saving my life.
Beckett : There's no need, Castle. We're partners. It's what we do.
UNK: Yes, some of us more than others, of course.
UNK: Wait, what is that supposed to mean?
UNK: Only that this is the eighth time you've saved my life
Castle : and I've saved your life nine times.
Beckett : Okay, first of all, I can't even believe that you're keeping score.
Beckett : And secondly, there is no way
Beckett : that you've saved my life more than I have yours.
UNK: Nine? Please.
UNK: Well, let's review, shall we?
UNK: The first time I distracted that mad gunman with the champagne bottle.
Castle : And, yes, that was a save. Even you admitted it.
Castle : The second time, the serial killer
Castle : put a bomb in your kitchen while you were taking a shower.
Castle : I had to brave the hellish flames
Castle : to pull you out of your bathtub.
Castle : Won't be forgetting that any time soon.
