Beckett : That's not enough time.
UNK: Trapper John : It is for me.
UNK: Trapper John : Take this guy now and get my bus outside in 20,
UNK: Trapper John : or I'll start popping hostages.
UNK: HANGS UP
UNK: How soon till we get that bus?
UNK: Thirty-five minutes.
UNK: You're gonna have to ask for more time.
Beckett : He's not gonna go for it.
UNK: Then we're gonna storm the bank.
Beckett : We can't storm the bank.
Beckett : We don't know where anybody is in there.
Beckett : If we go in there, hostages are just gonna get killed.
UNK: Listen, if we're gonna save any of them, we have no other choice.
Beckett : Maybe we do.
UNK: We could use this sick hostage to our advantage.
Beckett : Instead of sending in a paramedic,
Beckett : we send in a cop with tactical training.
Beckett : That cop gets intel
Beckett : for when SWAT goes in to breach the bank.
Peterson : I'm guessing you have a cop in mind?
UNK: TRAPPER JOHN : Search her.
UNK: She's clean.
UNK: TRAPPER JOHN : Make it quick.
Beckett : How's he doing?
Castle : Not good.
Castle : His name is Sal Martino. He has epilepsy.
Castle : I think the seizure was brought on by stress.
BECKETT : Okay.
Beckett : Hey, Sal, hey, buddy. How you doing?
Beckett : Sal, listen to me, I want you to know
Beckett : that there are people out there
Beckett : that care about you, so just keep breathing.
Beckett : I promise you,
UNK: I'm gonna get you out of here.
UNK: Dr Huxtable : Hey, don't talk about it, be about it.
Beckett : And you,
UNK: Dr Huxtable : help get him on that gurney. Now!
Castle : Sal, you ready? Gonna get you up on the count of three.
UNK: One, two, three.
UNK: SAL GRUNTING
Castle : Easy, buddy. Easy, buddy.
UNK: Easy.
Castle : You're all right.
UNK: DOOR CLOSES
UNK: SAL GRUNTING
Beckett : Your dad's okay. They're both okay.
Alexis : What's wrong?
Beckett : Alexis, I need you to go behind that yellow line, now.
Beckett : Take her behind the line, now. PHONE RINGS
ASHLEY : Hey... Wait, what?
Alexis : Ash! My father... Can you hear me?
Ashley : I'll call you later.
Alexis : No, you can't call me later!
Alexis : I can't hear you. Ash, I can't hear...
Alexis : What? Ash, I can't...
Peterson : There's C-4 in the bank?
Beckett : I didn't see any,
Beckett : but if Castle says it's in there, it's in there.
Peterson : Well, that means a breach is out of the question.
UNK: I'm not gonna send my boys into a bomb fight.
UNK: We have to take these guys out on the bus.
Beckett : That bus is still 20 minutes out. His deadline's in five.
UNK: He's gonna start killing hostages.
Peterson : We have to buy more time.
