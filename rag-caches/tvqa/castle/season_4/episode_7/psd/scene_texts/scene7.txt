UNK: Yeah, well, I don't think they're gonna let us use the computer.
Castle : Maybe we won't have to.
Castle : Mother, the bracelet I gave you for your birthday.
Martha : Oh, no, I love this bracelet.
UNK: Dr Howser : All right. UNCLASPS
UNK: Officer Monfriez : Captain, it's him.

Beckett : Hey, how's it going?
UNK: Trapper John : So far, so good.
Beckett : Yeah, and how are the hostages?
Beckett : Pretty concerned about the pregnant bank teller, Simone.
Beckett : It's kind of a stressful situation.
UNK: You might want to get her out of there.
UNK: Trapper John : No, no, no, Kate.
UNK: You gotta give before you can receive.
Beckett : Okay, what would you like?
UNK: Trapper John : A bus with tinted windows that'll take me, my partners
UNK: Trapper John : and my hostages to Teterboro Airport.
UNK: There, you're gonna have a plane waiting to take us
UNK: Trapper John : to the foreign country of my choosing.
UNK: When you do that, I give you the knocked-up bank teller.
UNK: Trapper John : Once we land in paradise, I'll release the rest of the hostages.
UNK: Trapper John : And, Kate,
UNK: Trapper John : you got three hours.
UNK: Hey, Monfriez, find me a bus with
UNK: Trapper John : tinted windows and get it over here.
Beckett : Wait a minute, you're actually giving him what he wants?
Peterson : Of course not. The only way the guy's leaving the building
UNK: is either in handcuffs or a body bag.
Peterson : But if it comes to it, I can use that bus
