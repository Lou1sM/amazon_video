Castle : Why does he keep going back there
Castle : when there's a vault full of cash up here that's untouched?
UNK: Oh, Richard,
Martha : I know that look, please. Curiosity killed the cat.
Castle : Something weird is going on here.
Castle : We need to figure out what it is.
Castle : And I know exactly what to do.
Castle : Don't worry, Mother. I saw this work on Die Hard.
Martha : Oh, great.
UNK: Great.
UNK: Uh, Mr. Howser. Excuse me, Dr. Howser?
UNK: Dr Howser : You got a death wish?
Castle : No, just a small bladder.
Castle : And, unfortunately, it looks like we're gonna be here for a while.
Castle : So unless you'd like it messy,
UNK: now might be a good time to start arranging some restroom runs.
Martha : Thank you.
UNK: EXHALES
Castle : So, why Doogie Howser?
UNK: I mean, there's so many cool TV doctors you can pick.
Castle : Dr. House, Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Phil.
UNK: Dr Howser : Shut up.
UNK: Anything?
Esposito : All bad news.
Esposito : ESU can't get eyes or ears inside.
UNK: Bank cameras are disabled,
Esposito : and the walls are too thick to drill from outside.
Beckett : So what if ESU storms the bank?
Esposito : They'll be going in blind.
Beckett : And in your experience, in this scenario,
Beckett : what are the hostages' chances of survival?
Davenport : Hey, I'm sorry about before.
UNK: Please, it's... Yeah.
UNK: No, it's the job.
Davenport : Actually, I'm a fan.
Davenport : A Midsummer Night's Dream,
Davenport : you played Titania, in Shakespeare in the Park.
Martha : That was in the '80s.
Martha : How could you possibly remember that?
Davenport : You were unforgettable.
Martha : If I have to die, I'm glad I'm going with someone who knows my work.
Martha : Thank you.
UNK: DR. HOWSER : All right, who else needs the loo?
Sal : I'll go.
Martha : Did you learn anything?
Castle : Two things. Firstly,
Castle : the restrooms here at the bank are quite lovely,
Castle : excepting for the lack of windows, or any other means of escape.
