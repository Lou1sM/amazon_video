UNK: KNOCKING ON DOOR
Monfriez : Agnes and Gideon Fields, open up, please! This is the NYPD!
UNK: PHONE BEEPS This doesn't make any sense.
Ryan : What could this old couple's safety-deposit box
Ryan : have to do with what's going on in that bank?
UNK: RADIO PLAYING Maybe everything.
UNK: The bank said that Agnes and Gideon
Esposito : were accessing their box once a month, right?
Esposito : I just got a text from the precinct.
Monfriez : Gideon Fields died four years ago,
UNK: so whoever's accessing that box wasn't him.
Ryan : Agnes, this is NYPD, open up, please.
Esposito : The radio's on.
UNK: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We can't go in there.
Ryan : We don't have a warrant. We don't have probable cause.
Esposito : Bro, Castle's life depends on this.
Ryan : Did you just hear that?
Ryan : I think I just heard someone yell out, "Help, Police!"
UNK: "Help! Police!" There it is again.
UNK: NYPD! Agnes!
UNK: RADIO PLAYING
UNK: COUGHING
UNK: GROANS
UNK: Yeah.
Ryan : It's Agnes.
Castle : What the hell is going on?
Esposito : Looks like the owner of our safety-deposit box
Esposito : has been dead maybe a week.
Esposito : Ligature marks on her neck indicate strangulation.
Ryan : What did you find at the crime scene?
Esposito : Place is trashed.
Esposito : Killer was looking for something.
Esposito : There's a broken keychain necklace on the body,
Esposito : but there's no key.
Beckett : That might have been where she kept the key for the safe-deposit box.
Esposito : I don't get it.
Esposito : This is a little, old, retired librarian.
Esposito : What could possibly be in her safe-deposit box
Esposito : that would be worth doing all this?
Ryan : Nazi gold, cold fusion, map to Atlantis.
UNK: Hey, Castle Jr., could you maybe start thinking like a cop, please?
Ryan : I am. Are you?
UNK: It had to have been something huge if it was worth killing her over, right?
Ryan : Hey, super cop, check it out.
Beckett : What is it? It's a bug.
Ryan : It's not from a spy shop, either. This looks professional.
Beckett : Listen, I need you to dig up everything you can on Agnes Fields.
Beckett : I gotta go.
UNK: Alexis Castle : They're here, aren't they? My dad and grandma are in there.
UNK: Alexis Castle : I know they were coming to this bank.
UNK: Alexis.. No one's answering their phones..
Alexis : My dad always takes my calls. And you're here.
UNK: Listen to me. Listen, listen. Everything is gonna be fine, okay?
Beckett : But they are inside that bank.
Beckett : What is it?
Castle : I need to get over to those windows
Castle : to get a message to Beckett about the C-4.
UNK: Oh... Richard, please. It is too dangerous.
Martha : We are hostages, behave accordingly.
UNK: Please.
UNK: Richard...
Castle : Uh, Dr. Quinn?
UNK: GUN COCKS What's your problem?
Castle : It's just where I come from, Dr. Quinn,
Castle : we don't make pregnant women sit on hard floors.
Castle : Is it all right if I get some cushions from the sofa for her?
UNK: Dr Quinn : Make it fast, pretty boy.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Dr Quinn : Stop! Right there! GASPS Oh!
UNK: Achshav. Or I'm going to shoot.
Ashley : Hey! Hey! I said stop!
Sal : I need air. Need air. Need air.
Castle : Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Castle : Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
UNK: VOICES OVERLAPPING
UNK: God!
Castle : Don't shoot.
Castle : He's having a seizure.
Castle : Sal? Easy.
UNK: GASPING
Castle : Great. Epilepsy. This guy needs help.
UNK: Dr Quinn : Then help him.
Castle : Hey, look, Dr. Quinn, the man just had a grand mal seizure,
Castle : so unless you really are a medicine woman,
Castle : he needs a hospital, now!
UNK: Dr Quinn : Get Trapper John. Move!
CASTLE : Perfect.
UNK: The fake doctor calls in another fake doctor for a consult.
Alexis : What am I supposed to do? Nothing.
Beckett : We're doing everything we can.
Alexis : You don't understand. They're all I've got.
Beckett : Do you hear me? They're all I've got.
Beckett : Alexis, listen to me.
Beckett : I promise you, they're gonna be okay.
Alexis : They better.

Alexis : My dad, he's...
Alexis : You've got to call me back right away, as soon as you get this.
Alexis : I really need you.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: TRAPPER JOHN : Look, Kate, one of the hostages had
UNK: Trapper John : an epileptic fit and passed out.
UNK: Trapper John : Normally, I wouldn't care, but it's starting to upset the other hostages,
UNK: Trapper John : and I don't want anyone trying to be a hero.
UNK: Trapper John : So, here's the deal,
UNK: you're gonna send in one paramedic to get him.
UNK: Trapper John : And in exchange for this generosity,
UNK: you're gonna have my b us right outside in 20.
