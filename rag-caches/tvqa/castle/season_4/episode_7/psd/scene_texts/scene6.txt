Castle : Well, I'm assuming the box isn't his.
Castle : These guys set off the alarm on purpose.
UNK: They wanted this hostage standoff.
UNK: I mean, come on, look at these guys. They're professionals, right?
Castle : They know better than to take the bottom bills from the cash drawer.
Davenport : But why?
UNK: Time.
UNK: Safe-deposit box keys don't have numbers on them.
Castle : So if it's not his key,
Castle : he'd have to try every lock, until they got to the right box.
Castle : And that would take time. Ah!
Castle : Okay, Mr. Davenport,
Castle : the box he pulled was on the north wall.
UNK: It was four columns over, three boxes down.
UNK: That would be box 120.
Castle : Okay, we figure out whose box that is,
Castle : we can figure out what these people are really up to.
