Martha : C-4? Are you sure?
UNK: Yeah! They're gonna blow us all up!
UNK: Calm down, okay? Just calm down.
Sal : How am I supposed to calm down?
Sal : I've got a family to think about. We all have families.
Martha : Now calm down.

Sal : Sal. Sal Martino.
UNK: Okay.
Castle : You got a wife, Sal? Kids?
Sal : Yeah, I have a son.
Castle : What's his name?
UNK: Connor.
Castle : I bet the only thing you can think about
UNK: is seeing him again, am I right?
Sal : You have no idea.

UNK: You think about how you're gonna see Connor again real soon.
