UNK: Martha Rodgers : This is outrageous, sir!
UNK: Martha Rodgers : You are nothing but a well-dressed loan shark!
UNK: Mr Davenport : Ms. Rodgers, I assure you, this is a very competitive interest rate,
UNK: Mr Davenport : considering your financial history.
UNK: However, if your son co-signs... Yes.
Martha : No, no, no.
Martha : This is my loan, not his.
Martha : To pay for repairs to my acting studio, not his.
UNK: If you would just let me co-sign the loan.
UNK: Or I could just give you the money.
UNK: Richard, I'm a businesswoman now.
Martha : I do not want your money, I do not want your signature.
Martha : Thank you very much. It's the principle.
Davenport : No, Ms. Rodgers,
Davenport : it's the interest.
Castle : And I've just lost mine, excuse me.
UNK: I have a million dollars put into this...
UNK: PHONE RINGING
UNK: Kate Beckett : What do you want, Castle?

Beckett : but you're welcome to come and do your share, for once.
Castle : Only thing wor se than being here
Castle : is being there doing paperwork.
Beckett : You know, how come we're partners when I'm chasing down bad guys,
Beckett : and as soon as there's paperwork, I'm on a solo mission?
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: What?
Castle : I think this bank is about to be robbed.
UNK: Really? Are you that bored?
Castle : There's a man and a woman here,
Castle : dressed in scrubs,
Castle : and both of them have suspicious bulges in their jackets.
Beckett : Castle, I think your writer's imagination is getting away with you.
UNK: Everybody, get down on the floor!
UNK: SOFTLY It's not my imagination.
Castle : It's definitely not my imagination.
UNK: PEOPLE YELLING
UNK: Move, move, move, move, move, move!

UNK: DR. HOWSER : You! Get down on the floor!
UNK: Dr Huxtable : Bank manager, over here!
Castle : Another one is going for the bank manager.
UNK: He's getting the manager's key.
UNK: SHOUTING
Castle : He's going to the back of the bank.
UNK: Yo, we got squad cars en route.
Beckett : Castle, I need you to listen very carefully, how many are there?
Castle : There are three.
