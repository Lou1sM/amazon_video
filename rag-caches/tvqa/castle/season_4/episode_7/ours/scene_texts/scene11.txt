Beckett : You know, they were probab smart enough to pay in cash,
Beckett : which is untraceable.
Ryan : Unless if paying by check wouldn't have thrown up any red flags.
UNK: And at the time of Connor and Tanya's supposed deaths,
Ryan : she was making monthly tithe checks to Saint Abigail's Church.
Castle : And who better fits this profile than a priest?
UNK: And I know which one we should speak to first.
UNK: The priest who officiated their funeral,
Ryan : Father Sean McCaskey.
Beckett : Father McCaskey, I'm Detective Kate Beckett, this is Richard Castle.
Beckett : We need to know where Tanya and Connor Brandt are hiding.
Esposito : I don't know what you're talking about.
UNK: Father Sean Mccaskey : Tanya and Connor have been dead for over a year.
UNK: Father, you don't understand.
Beckett : Agnes Fields has been murdered.
Castle : Ron Brandt has the contents of her safe-deposit box.
Beckett : He's on his way to them now.
UNK: What? How could this happen?
UNK: Father Mccaskey : That box was there to protect them.
Beckett : It didn't, Father, but we can. We need to know their address.
Esposito : Of course.
UNK: 14 Cascadilla Street, Ithaca.
Castle : Ithaca. That's only four hours away.
Castle : Ron could already be there by now.
UNK: Thanks. Yes.
UNK: RAPPING ON DOOR
Ron : Honey, I'm home.
UNK: GASPING
Tanya : Stay back!

Ron : Oh, no, hon, you bumped your head.
UNK: SOBBING
UNK: GAME BEEPING
Ashley : Hey, hey.
UNK: There's my boy.
Ron : Did you miss your daddy?
UNK: Come on, come on.
UNK: Man, what the hell 's taking so long?
Ryan : Can't believe they've still got us on hold.
Castle : Beckett, if he gets a hold of that kid...
UNK: SCREAMING Mommy!
UNK: Please don't take him. Baby!
UNK: SCREAMS Not in front of him, please.
UNK: Baby...
UNK: CLICKS
UNK: GASPS
Ron : Why would I kill you?
Ron : I want you to live a long, long life with the knowledge
UNK: that you're never gonna see Connor again.
Ron : Now it's my tu rn to disappear.
Ron : But unlike you, I know how to hide.
UNK: CONNOR SCREAMS
UNK: Come on, buddy. Come o Connor!n.
UNK: Connor!
UNK: Dr Quinn : Right there. Don't move.

Beckett : Okay, thanks.
UNK: REPLACES RECEIVER
Beckett : They found them.
UNK: Tanya's gonna need a few stitches, but Connor's okay.
Beckett : Come on, let's go pick him up.
UNK: Ithaca?
Castle : Even as a hostage, I help you solve murders.
Castle : Beckett, I think...
Castle : I think you have the perfect partner.
Beckett : Yeah, except he doesn't like doing paperwork.
UNK: Touche.
Beckett : So, Old Haunt? I'll buy you a drink.
Castle : No, but I'll do you one better.
UNK: Trapper John : Oh, Kate!
Martha : Oh, darling, you can join us, you great, beautiful creature.
Martha : Come in.
UNK: Wow, Martha, you...
Castle : You really... How did you?
Beckett : I did.
Martha : Facing death demands celebrating life.
Martha : Tonight, we feast!
Castle : Where's Alexis?
Martha : Oh, she's...
Castle : Excuse me, one minute. Yeah.
UNK: So, yes?
UNK: Please.
Alexis : Ash, it's not about today. It's about the last 100 days.
Alexis : You're never here for me.
Alexis : Just because you're in California doesn't mean I should have
Alexis : to hold my breath, cross my fingers, and wish upon a star,
Alexis : just to get a text from you.
Alexis : Yeah, more excuses.
Alexis : Ash, I just can't do this anymore.
Alexis : We're done.
UNK: BEEPS
UNK: KNOCKING CLEARS THROAT

UNK: No.
UNK: ALEXIS SIGHS
Alexis : But ask me again tomorrow.
Martha : Alexis, darling, help me with the Duck I'Orange, s'il vous plait.
CASTLE : Ah! Thank you.
Castle : And I didn't get a chance to properly thank you for saving my life.
Beckett : There's no need, Castle. We're partners. It's what we do.
UNK: Yes, some of us more than others, of course.
UNK: Wait, what is that supposed to mean?
UNK: Only that this is the eighth time you've saved my life
Castle : and I've saved your life nine times.
Beckett : Okay, first of all, I can't even believe that you're keeping score.
Beckett : And secondly, there is no way
Beckett : that you've saved my life more than I have yours.
UNK: Nine? Please.
UNK: Well, let's review, shall we?
UNK: The first time I distracted that mad gunman with the champagne bottle.
Castle : And, yes, that was a save. Even you admitted it.
Castle : The second time, the serial killer
Castle : put a bomb in your kitchen while you were taking a shower.
Castle : I had to brave the hellish flames
Castle : to pull you out of your bathtub.
Castle : Won't be forgetting that any time soon.
