Beckett : But they are inside that bank.
Beckett : What is it?
Castle : I need to get over to those windows
Castle : to get a message to Beckett about the C-4.
UNK: Oh... Richard, please. It is too dangerous.
Martha : We are hostages, behave accordingly.
UNK: Please.
UNK: Richard...
Castle : Uh, Dr. Quinn?
UNK: GUN COCKS What's your problem?
Castle : It's just where I come from, Dr. Quinn,
Castle : we don't make pregnant women sit on hard floors.
Castle : Is it all right if I get some cushions from the sofa for her?
UNK: Dr Quinn : Make it fast, pretty boy.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Dr Quinn : Stop! Right there! GASPS Oh!
UNK: Achshav. Or I'm going to shoot.
Ashley : Hey! Hey! I said stop!
Sal : I need air. Need air. Need air.
Castle : Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Castle : Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
UNK: VOICES OVERLAPPING

Castle : Sal? Easy.
UNK: GASPING
Castle : Great. Epilepsy. This guy needs help.
UNK: Dr Quinn : Then help him.
Castle : Hey, look, Dr. Quinn, the man just had a grand mal seizure,
Castle : so unless you really are a medicine woman,
Castle : he needs a hospital, now!
UNK: Dr Quinn : Get Trapper John. Move!
CASTLE : Perfect.
UNK: The fake doctor calls in another fake doctor for a consult.
Alexis : What am I supposed to do? Nothing.
Beckett : We're doing everything we can.
Alexis : You don't understand. They're all I've got.
Beckett : Do you hear me? They're all I've got.
Beckett : Alexis, listen to me.
Beckett : I promise you, they're gonna be okay.
Alexis : They better.
UNK: Office Monfriez : Beckett, incoming call.
Beckett : Okay, I gotta go. Stay with her.
UNK: DIALING
UNK: RINGING
UNK: ON VOICEMAIL Hey, it's Ash. I'll hit you back.
UNK: BEEPS
Alexis : Ash, I know you're busy, but I need you.
Alexis : My dad, he's...
Alexis : You've got to call me back right away, as soon as you get this.
Alexis : I really need you.
UNK: Beckett.
UNK: TRAPPER JOHN : Look, Kate, one of the hostages had
UNK: Trapper John : an epileptic fit and passed out.
UNK: Trapper John : Normally, I wouldn't care, but it's starting to upset the other hostages,
UNK: Trapper John : and I don't want anyone trying to be a hero.
UNK: Trapper John : So, here's the deal,
UNK: you're gonna send in one paramedic to get him.
UNK: Trapper John : And in exchange for this generosity,
UNK: you're gonna have my b us right outside in 20.
Beckett : That's not enough time.
UNK: Trapper John : It is for me.
UNK: Trapper John : Take this guy now and get my bus outside in 20,
UNK: Trapper John : or I'll start popping hostages.
UNK: HANGS UP
UNK: How soon till we get that bus?
UNK: Thirty-five minutes.
UNK: You're gonna have to ask for more time.
Beckett : He's not gonna go for it.
UNK: Then we're gonna storm the bank.
Beckett : We can't storm the bank.
Beckett : We don't know where anybody is in there.
Beckett : If we go in there, hostages are just gonna get killed.
UNK: Listen, if we're gonna save any of them, we have no other choice.
Beckett : Maybe we do.
UNK: We could use this sick hostage to our advantage.
Beckett : Instead of sending in a paramedic,
Beckett : we send in a cop with tactical training.
Beckett : That cop gets intel
Beckett : for when SWAT goes in to breach the bank.
Peterson : I'm guessing you have a cop in mind?
