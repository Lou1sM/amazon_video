BECKETT : More like motive.
Castle : So Bailey was using his pickup-artist skills
Castle : to sleep with Ron Hill's wif and steal corporate secrets.
Castle : Man, there's a penetrating enemy lines joke here somewhere.
Holly : You know, Ron must've hit the roof
Beckett : when he discovered that those files were stolen.
UNK: Well, sure, Ron got screwed on the deal
Castle : and his wife got screwed.
UNK: If anybody ever had motive for murder, it was Ron Hill.
Esposito : Yeah. Except he was in negotiations during the poisoning kill zone,
Castle : and his wife Lisa alibied, too.
UNK: And I'm looking into the KPW deal.
UNK: Turns out that they're represented by Keller, Braun and Franklin.
Ryan : Guess who their lead attorney is?
UNK: Holly Franklin? Yep. Miss No-tell Hotel herself.
Ryan : The only reason you guys didn't run into her at Global 12 Consolidated
UNK: is that we were still holding her.
Beckett : That explains the Lisa and Holly connection.
Castle : Yeah, but it begs the question,
Castle : how many other wom en did Bailey target
Castle : in this little sexpionage scheme?
Beckett : You guys get a list of all the people at KPW that were working the sale,
Beckett : including the banking and legal teams.
Beckett : All right.
Beckett : There's no way that Bailey was working this alone.
Beckett : He's too junior.
Castle : And besides, he was on leave.
Beckett : And who authorized the leave?
UNK: Yes, I authorized his leave.
UNK: You gave him a fake ID and cash bonuses, Mr. Harris.
UNK: And I've already told you, I don't know anything about that.
Beckett : Okay, well, how about this?
Beckett : Bailey slept with Holly Franklin and Ron Hill's wife, Lisa,
Beckett : to steal KPW secrets for your negotiation.
Beckett : Did you know about that?
UNK: Oh, come on, Harris,
Castle : this couldn't be Bailey's idea.
Castle : You're his boss,
UNK: and you're Global 12 Consolidated's lead negotiator for the KPW deal.
UNK: So how did it start?
