BECKETT : Excuse me.
Beckett : Sorry to interrupt again.
Amy : What's up, Seth?
Harris : Nothing. Nothing at all.
Harris : Look, Detective, I have already told you
Harris : everything that I know about Michael Bailey.
Harris : Now please, leave.
Beckett : Actually, we're not here for you, Mr. Harris.
UNK: Ron Hill : That would be the SEC. Soon.
Beckett : Today, we are here for a woman.
Beckett : Someone who works for KPW and also knew Michael Bailey.
Beckett : Your C.O.O., Amy Kemp.
Beckett : You are under arrest for the murder of Michael Bailey.
Amy : Pleasure doing business with you, Seth.
BECKETT : Let's go. HANDCUFFS CLICKING
CASTLE : She said killing him was just business.

UNK: Made her feel special, got her to fall for him.
