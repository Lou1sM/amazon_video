Harris : But maybe it had something to do with that woman
Harris : that tried to break into his office yesterday.
Beckett : Who was that I don't know?
Harris : She was gone before security got there.
Beckett : And who reported it?
Amy : I had stepped out of negotiations to go to the restroom.
Amy : And in the hallway, I noticed a woman was trying to pick an office-door lock
Amy : using a wrench and an opened-up paper clip.
Amy : I assumed she had just locked herself out of her office
Amy : and joked that a key would work better.
Amy : Well, she was startled and shoved me over
Amy : and made a dash for the stairwell.
Beckett : Did you get a good look at her?
Amy : Yeah. And I told security.
Amy : She was exotic, 30-ish, dark, wavy hair.
Amy : She had on an overcoat, but it was open,
Amy : and she was wearing a pin with a Star of David on it.
