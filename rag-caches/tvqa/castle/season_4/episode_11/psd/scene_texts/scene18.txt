Esposito : Can I show you to your seat?
Lanie : That would be nice.
BECKETT : Castle!
Beckett : You look like a lost puppy.
Beckett : Where's your date?
Castle : At a Lady Gaga concert with a teenage boy.
Castle : How do I compete with that?
Beckett : Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Castle : Yeah. Me, too. I hate going to weddings alone.
Beckett : Well, maybe we could be each other's plus-one.
Castle : Yeah. And then avoid the stigma of sitting at the singles table.
Castle : Yes. That would be nice. I would like that.
Beckett : Oh, look at him. He looks so happy.
