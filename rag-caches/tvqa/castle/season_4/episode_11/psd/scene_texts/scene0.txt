UNK: EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST What are you drinking?
UNK: Richard Castle : Toxic waste?
UNK: Jenny Duffy O'malley : We're doing a cleanse.
UNK: Jenny Duffy O'malley : And he forgot his bottle, so I came by to drop it off.
Castle : Oh, he forgot it? Are you sure? Mmm.
Ryan : Actually, I've never felt better in my entire life.
Ryan : Water, lime juice, no solid food.
UNK: Jenny and I are gonna start our marriage perfectly cleansed.
Jenny : We've already made it a week. We only have three days to go.
UNK: Kate Beckett : I can't even believe you guys are already getting married on Sunday.
Jenny : I know, isn't that crazy?
UNK: I better run. My mom is freaking out about place cards.
Jenny : See you there.
UNK: Thanks, sweetie. I love you.
Jenny : I love you more. Oh, it's not possible.
Ryan : I know, I know, I know. We're nauseating.
UNK: Javier Esposito : Well, I am looking forward to meeting some of Jenny's sorority sisters.
UNK: I am about to show them some of New York's finest.
Ryan : Oh, good.
Ryan : Then I guess you won't care that Lanie is bringing a plus-one.
UNK: Who?
Ryan : I don't know. She just RSVP'd plus-one.
Esposito : How can she already have a boyfriend? We just broke up.
Beckett : Don't worry, Espo. I'm going alone.
