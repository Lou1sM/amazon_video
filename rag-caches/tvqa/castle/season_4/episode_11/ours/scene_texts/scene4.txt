UNK: Oh, then I'm sure you'll be able to tell us
Castle : where the two of you were yesterday
Castle : between the hours of 4 : 00 and 6 : 00 p.m.?
Colette : I was outside his apartment waiting for him.
Colette : But he never came.
Beckett : You had a very busy day yesterday.
Beckett : You were seen trying to break into his office just hours before that.
Colette : I was hoping to find some kind of clue.
Colette : Something that might lead me to his enemies.
Colette : His enemies?
Colette : Michael was a hunted man.
Beckett : Hunted by who?
Ryan : I don't know.
Colette : I just know he was in trouble.
Colette : Four weeks ago, he said he was going to Europe,
Colette : but I kept seeing him in the city.
Colette : And he kept pretending not to notice me,
Colette : so I staked out his apartment.
Castle : So you stalked him?
Colette : Staked, stalked, what's the difference?
Colette : I was looking out for him. But he wasn't coming home.
Colette : Then a few days ago, I finally confronted him.
Colette : He said he couldn't talk,
Colette : but he told me to meet him the next day, and he'd explain everything.
Beckett : Let me guess. That was the last time you saw him.
Colette : No. We met the next day.
Colette : But before he could tell me what was going on,
Colette : this car came out of nowhere. And they were on us.
UNK: Who? Ruffians, in ski masks.
Colette : They grabbed him and threw him in the back.
