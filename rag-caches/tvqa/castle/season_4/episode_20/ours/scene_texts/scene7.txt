Wyndham : To new friendships.
Wyndham : Now, tell me, Miss Harrington, are you here alone?
Wyndham : If so, it would be a grave injustice.
Beckett : My date's more interested in networking than he is in me.
Wyndham : In that case, he won't object if I asked you for a dance.
Castle : You know what? I wouldn't care even if he did.
Wyndham : Shall we?
UNK: Mmm-hmm.
UNK: So, tell me, Miss Harrington, what should I know about you?
Beckett : Well, there's more to me than meets the eye.
UNK: Wow. What meets the eye is irresistible.
Beckett : You know, actions speak louder than words.
UNK: Meaning?
UNK: Meaning, if I'm so irresistible,
Beckett : then why aren't you using both your hands?
Hunt : Excuse me, Your Excellency.
Hunt : Oh! Excuse me. Pardon me, coming through.
UNK: Sorry, sir, as you were.
Beckett : Excuse me.
UNK: Excuse me. Sir Alfred Heath?
UNK: Yes?
UNK: Might I have a word, sir?
UNK: Security Man Bryson : There seems to be two of you here this evening.
UNK: BOTH CHUCKLE
UNK: Sorry.
Wyndham : I have to ask.
Wyndham : Are you as aggressive in your other activities
Wyndham : as you are on the dance floor?
Beckett : You know, what can I say? I like to lead, all the time.
UNK: TALKING INDISTINCTLY
Castle : Are you... Is, is everything all right?
Beckett : Um... Yeah, you know, I'm suddenly,
Beckett : I feel very hungry, excuse me.
UNK: Would you like one of these? I hear they're great.
Wyndham : I'm not a caviar man, myself.
Beckett : Yeah, but I hear that they're an aphrodisiac.
Wyndham : Not for me, I'm afraid.
UNK: I'm sorry to intrude, Mr. Wyndham, sir...
UNK: Yes, what is it, Bryson?
UNK: Security Guy Bryson : The young lady. I need her to come with me.
Wyndham : Well, for what purpose?
UNK: Don't worry, darling. I know that we'll see each other again very soon.
UNK: SIGHS I had the waiter, then I lost him.
UNK: I've bollocksed up the whole plan and now we've got nothing.
