UNK: Wow. You guys going out?
Hunt : I pulled some strings
Hunt : and got us into a party at the British Consulate tonight.
Beckett : Nigel will be there.
Beckett : We'll get his prints and he won't even know it.
Hunt : Cheers, lads.
Ryan : Or they could do that.
UNK: Tech Guy : Yeah. Sure. If you want to do it the easy way.
Hunt : Thank you.
Beckett : So, who is Sir Alfred Heath?
Hunt : Tonight, I am.
Hunt : The lads back home said the real Sir Alfred is down as a no-show.
UNK: Gout or some damn thing.
Beckett : Yeah, but what if Nigel Wyndham doesn't show either?
Hunt : He'll be here.
Hunt : And I expect he'll skip the champagne
Hunt : and drink something posh and pretentious.
UNK: Leaving his print on the glass.
Beckett : What if he doesn't drink?
Hunt : He's British. Trust me, he drinks.
Hunt : May I?
Beckett : I didn't realize that dancing was a part of the plan.
UNK: Well, it offers a perfect vantage point.
UNK: Huh.
Beckett : Do you come to a lot of these events?
Hunt : No, thank God. Why?
Beckett : You just seem very confident.
UNK: Well, that's because my companion
Hunt : is the most beautiful woman in this room.
UNK: CHUCKLES That's clearly the champagne talking.
UNK: I'm sure you're just comfortable here
Beckett : because you're amongst your own people.
Hunt : These aren't my people.
Hunt : My people are the ones carrying the trays.
Hunt : Yeah. I grew up on the East End.
Hunt : My mum cleaned flats. Dad worked in a factory.
Hunt : They wanted something better. They just...
UNK: They couldn't quite get it.
Hunt : And then?
Hunt : I was admitted to Eton on a scholarship
Hunt : where I minored in blending in.
Hunt : What about you?
Beckett : I grew up in the city. And went to college in California.
Hunt : Well, you could obviously do anything you put your mind to.
Hunt : Why be a cop?
Beckett : I guess it was just my calling.
UNK: Ah, a crusader. I know the type.
Hunt : Doesn't leave a lot of time for a personal life though, does it?
Hunt : What about you? Are you the crusader type as well?
Hunt : Married to the Bill, I'm afraid. The job comes first.
UNK: Though sometimes I wish it didn't.
Beckett : Yeah. I know the feeling.
UNK: Absolutely.
UNK: WHISPERING Wait a minute. Look over there by the bar.
UNK: My one o'clock.
Hunt : Let the games begin.
UNK: All right. Take care.
UNK: Nigel Wyndham : Good evening.
Beckett : Nigel Wyndham. Deputy General.
Beckett : Jean Harrington. Bored.
Wyndham : Well, we'll have to remedy that, Miss Harrington.
Wyndham : One for the lady, please.
Beckett : Oh, a ring. That's discouraging.
UNK: Oh, well, it needn't be.
