Hunt : but if you were in a foreign country
Hunt : and someone you loved was killed,
Hunt : what would you do?
Castle : What were they looking for?
Hunt : When he was on the job,
Hunt : Naomi's dad used to stash a gun in the lining of his Kevlar.
Hunt : When Naomi started modeling as a teenager,
Hunt : he didn't want her on the Underground without any protection.
Hunt : So he taught her to cut a tiny piece of the lining in her jacket
Hunt : to stash pepper spray. That's where I found it.
Beckett : You found what?
Hunt : A message to me. About her killer.
Castle : What kind of message?
Hunt : Not until I'm on the case.
Beckett : Excuse me?
Hunt : Detective, please. I owe this to Naomi. I owe it to her family.
Beckett : You do realize that I could arrest you for withholding evidence.
Hunt : And since you don't know what that evidence is, I could deny it.
Hunt : And none of that will get us any closer to catching her killer.
Hunt : Let me work this case with you.
Hunt : Because if you don't, I swear,
Hunt : I'll go out there and catch the bastard on my own.
UNK: Okay.
Beckett : But I have to check in with my captain first.
Hunt : What's she like, your captain?
Castle : You ever see that YouTube video
Castle : of the grizzly bear that decapitates a moose
Castle : with one swipe of its paw?
UNK: Comforting.
Castle : It's nothing personal.
Castle : She just doesn't like outsiders in her precinct.
Hunt : I don't need her to like it. I just need her to allow it.
Hunt : This whole thing with Naomi doesn't add up.
Hunt : Turning down conventional modeling jobs,
UNK: booking sleazy gigs at private parties,
