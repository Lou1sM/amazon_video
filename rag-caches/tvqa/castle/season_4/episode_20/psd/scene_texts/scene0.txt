BECKETT : I'm telling you, something happened, something changed.
UNK: Kate Beckett : It's been weird between us lately.
UNK: Lately? Kate, it's been weird for four years.
Beckett : No. This is different.
Beckett : He's different. It's like he's pulling away.
Lanie : Well, can you blame him? He's probably tired of waiting.
Beckett : Waiting for what?
Lanie : What do you think?
Lanie : The guy is crazy about you,
Lanie : and despite your little act, you're crazy about him.
Lanie : Oh, what? Was that supposed to be some big secret?
UNK: Yes.
UNK: No.
Beckett : Do you think he knows?
Lanie : You remember how he used to be?
Lanie : Girl on either arm?
Lanie : You really don't see that guy too much anymore.
Lanie : Why do you think that is?
Lanie : He's waiting for you.
Beckett : Yeah, but, Lanie...
Lanie : I know. You're dealing with stuff.
Lanie : But you cannot ask him to wait forever.
Lanie : Unless, of course, you're okay with him pulling away.
Beckett : What if it doesn't work? What if it ends up like you and Javi?
Lanie : Well, at least we gave it a shot.
Lanie : And so it didn't work out. So what?
Lanie : Now we can move on. Give or take the occasional booty call.
UNK: I just, I don't wanna lose what we have, you know?
Lanie : Girl, please. What exactly do you have? Really?
Beckett : A friendship?
Lanie : No. What you and I have, is a friendship.
Lanie : What you and Castle have is a holding pattern.
Lanie : How long can you circle before the fuel runs out?
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGING
