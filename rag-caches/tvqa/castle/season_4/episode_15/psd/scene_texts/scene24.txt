UNK: Same man that's trying to pull off Pandora.
Blakely : You mean they're trying to make it happen?
Blakely : This is even worse than I thought.
Gates : All right, talk.
Blakely : I need to go inside first.
Beckett : You're not going anywhere until you tell me about Pandora. What is it?
Blakely : It was the name of a white paper that I wrote.
Castle : For whom?
Blakely : I was hired by a think tank to identify weaknesses in US security
Blakely : so they could be shored up, protected.
Blakely : I found an alarming vulnerability.
Blakely : A linchpin that was tied to the economy
Blakely : that would cause crisis and devastation
Blakely : beyond anything we'd ever seen.
UNK: The dominoes would just never stop falling.
Blakely : I asked Tracy to follow up with the think tank,
Blakely : but they don't exist.
Blakely : Whoever they are, I gave them the blueprint
Blakely : that will bring about the en of our country as we know it.
Epsosito : Dr. Blakely, what is the linchpin?
Blakely : A flock of pigeons.
Beckett : Blakely, the linchpin. What is it?
Blakely : Pigeons don't fly in flocks unless they're fleeing a predator. They're here.
CASTLE : Hey! Wait! Wait, wait!
UNK: Blakely! GUNSHOT
UNK: Come on! Come on!
UNK: Becket Hold on, Castle. Hold on!t!
