Castle : I just...
UNK: That is a military-grade cell phone, and a scrambler.
Castle : That's spy equipment.
Beckett : Tracy came here to make a phone call
Beckett : and I bet you that the last number she dialed is still on the phone.
MAN : Close the case and turn around.
Beckett : Hands in the air.
BECKETT : Gage.
Gage : Your weapon and phones on the ground.
Beckett : Really? You put your hands in the air.
UNK: Whoa!
Gage : Phones on the ground?
Castle : I just upgraded. This is a brand new phone.
Gage : Now, I'm afraid you're not gonna like what comes next.
BECKETT : Castle?
UNK: Castle, what are you doing?
Castle : Bracing myself to shield you from a hail of bullets.
UNK: Kate Beckett : Yeah, well, it's very gallant of you.
Beckett : But you can stop bracing. I think he left.
UNK: And my life was passing before my eyes, I think I lost track of time.
Beckett : What do you know about trunk latches?
UNK: Well, the bad news is, this one was not designed to open from the inside.
Beckett : And the good news?
Castle : At least this time we're not handcuffed together.
UNK: Surprisingly roomy in here.
Beckett : It's not that roomy.
Beckett : Sooner or later, we're gonna run out of air.
UNK: Got to get out of here.
Castle : Maybe somebody will find us.
Beckett : Castle, we are locked in the trunk of a car in long-term parking.
UNK: It's gonna be hours before anyone realizes that we're missing.
Beckett : Who do you think is going to find us?
UNK: I just feel in situations like this, it's important to have faith.
