UNK: "Buttons"?
Castle : You have a friend named "Buttons"? A human friend?
UNK: Alexis Castle : Her mom called her that wh she was little and it stuck.
UNK: CHUCKLES Now so is she.
Alexis : Buttons and I bonded over being rejected from Stanford.
Alexis : In fact, we applied to a lot of the same schools,
UNK: so we were planning to visit a few campuses together this weekend.
Alexis : Make a road trip out of it.
Castle : Whoa! Okay, whoa.
Castle : Where are you staying, who's driving and who's chaperoning?
Alexis : We were going to take your Ferrari
Alexis : and hook up with some boys we met on Craigslist.
Castle : Not cool.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : Honey, don't be such a killjoy.
UNK: Martha Rodgers : I'm sure Buttons' mother is going along.
Alexis : She is, and she's very responsible.
Castle : Yeah, except when it comes to picking nicknames.
Alexis : Look, if you want,
UNK: I could have Mrs. Dutton stop by to meet you when she picks me up.
UNK: Yeah, I think that'd be...
Castle : Her last name is Dutton?
UNK: Your friend's name is "Buttons Dutton"?
Martha : That is unfortunate.
UNK: CELL PHONE RINGS What's so wrong with that?
Beckett : Come on, it'd be like calling me "Rassle" or "Tassle"
UNK: or "No Hassle Castle".
UNK: Hey. No, I was just making a point.
