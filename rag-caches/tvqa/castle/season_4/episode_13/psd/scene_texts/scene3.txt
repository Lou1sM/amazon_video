UNK: between 5 : 15 and 5 : 35?
Hernand : Yeah, I was right here at my grooming station, filing my appeal...
Hernand : I didn't kill him, okay?
UNK: Given everything he was into, I'd say he brought it on himself.
Beckett : And what exactly was he into?
Hernand : Well, rumor has it, he was on the take.
Castle : Are you saying he was taking bribes to fix dog shows?
Hernand : Betting on dog shows, it's a big business.
UNK: And he was seen with some pretty shady characters.
Hernand : People with ties to Vegas.
Beckett : That's a serious allegation. Do you have any proof to back it up?
Hernand : You want proof?
Hernand : That's who Francisco selected Best in Show.
Hernand : Just look at that mutt.
Hernand : Now back to my Max, now the mutt.
Hernand : That's all the proof I need.
BECKETT : Really? There's big money riding on dog shows?
Castle : It's actually kind of ingenious.
Beckett : You know, everyone's got football,
UNK: basketball, horse-racing under a microscope,
Castle : looking for the slightest hint of impropriety.
Castle : Who's looking at dog shows?
UNK: I'm gonna have Ryan look into it, along with Hernand's alibi.
Esposito : Whatever you're talking about, it can wait.
Esposito : Ma'am, please tell Detective Beckett what you told me.
UNK: Kelly Gunther : I was backstage after the show,
UNK: Kelly Gunther : when I saw a woman leave Francisco's dressing room.
Beckett : Can you describe her?
Kelly : Even better. I took a video with my phone.
