Marcus : I drove back there to check on the signal, all right?
Marcus : Thought maybe I could find out when the dog was going back to Kay.
Marcus : The things I heard that Francisco guy talking about?
Marcus : Yeah, he was into some sketchy stuff.
UNK: Really, bro? You're gonna sit here and call someone else sketchy?
Marcus : Listen to what I'm saying, all right?
Marcus : The guy was talking about shipments from Argentina.
Marcus : Getting past Customs. Street values?
CASTLE : Drugs?
UNK: And it seems to fit his travel.
Ryan : In addition to his international trips,
UNK: made a lot of flights to Boston, New Orleans, Seattle, Long Beach, Miami.
Castle : All port cities. Exactly.
Beckett : The international travel to judge dog shows. That's a perfect cover.
Castle : So our dog trainer was a drug courier.
Castle : No wonder he was so paranoid about being bugged.
Beckett : Then that warehouse that we saw?
Esposito : Breeding facility, my ass.
BECKETT : The "Pilar Retriever"?
UNK: It's a pretty good story, right?
Patterson : Hey, I had to get you out of there somehow.
Beckett : Mr. Patterson, I don't think you understand how serious this is.
