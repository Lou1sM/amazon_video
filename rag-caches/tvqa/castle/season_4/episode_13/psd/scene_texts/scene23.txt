UNK: Or what then, alternating nights? Weekends, weekdays?
Beckett : I think it'll just confuse the poor guy.
Castle : God knows he's had enough therapy.
Beckett : I think he deserves one home.
UNK: Oh! I see where this is going.
UNK: BLOWING
Beckett : No. No, no Roshambo.
Castle : You got a better idea?
Beckett : I think we should let Royal decide.
Beckett : We go to opposite ends of the room.
Beckett : And wherever he goes, that's home.
Castle : Let's do it.
Castle : Let's do it. Sit down. Sit down.
UNK: Good boy. Stay there. Stay there.
Kay : All right.
UNK: Ready?
UNK: Ready.
UNK: Come here, boy.
Beckett : Come over here, Royal. Come here, Royal.
UNK: Come on, come over here, boy. Come right here.
UNK: It's a big decision,
Castle : but I know you'll make the right one. Royal, who loves you?
UNK: Come on! My couch is super comfortable.
UNK: Come on, buddy. Come right over here, baby.
Beckett : You know in your heart.
UNK: Come on, Royal. Who's beautiful?
UNK: Man's best friend. Man's!
Kay : Looks like he's made his choice and it's me!
UNK: BARKING
UNK: You have such good taste, Royal!
Kay : Hi, buddy. You have very good taste. Hi, buddy.
BECKETT : Are you sure you want to take him?
Castle : Yeah, maybe we should do two out of three.
KAY : Yes! Lolita and I need a big, strong man around the house.
Kay : Especially one as loyal as this. Right, bud?
Kay : Royal, you are officially a Cappuccio now.
Kay : And you have been so sweet.
UNK: LAUGHS Oh!
Esposito : You know, I know that the paparazzi can be very vicious sometimes.
Esposito : So if you ever need anything, and I mean anything at all,
Esposito : you know where to find me.
UNK: I just might take you up on that one day.
BECKETT : Well, you know what? I mean, I'm sure it's for the best.
UNK: He would have been lonely at my place. There's nobody to play with.
Castle : Yeah, mine, too.
UNK: SIGHS
Castle : They do look like they enjoy each other.
UNK: Hmm.
UNK: SNIFFING
Castle : Hey, sweetheart. How was your trip?
Alexis : We had fun. Miss me?
Castle : Terribly. But I did manage to have a good time without you
Castle : with my new friend Royal, the dog.
Alexis : You got a dog?
Castle : No, but I was looking after him for a while. But it made me think,
Castle : all those times when you were little,
Castle : how you begged me for a do and I refused because...
Alexis : You said you'd be the one who'd wind up having to feed it.
Alexis : And it was hard enough remembering to feed me every day.
UNK: Yeah, I don't remember that last part.
Alexis : It was subtext. Barely.
UNK: Anyway, I want to make it up to you.
