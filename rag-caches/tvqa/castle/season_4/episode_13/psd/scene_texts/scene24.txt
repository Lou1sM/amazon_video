Castle : I want to get you a dog.
Castle : Only question is, what kind of dog do we get?
UNK: What are we gonna name it? Whose room is it gonna sleep in?
Alexis : Whoa, Dad, slow down. I'm leaving for college soon, remember?
Alexis : You can't have a dog in your dorm room.
UNK: Right.
Castle : I know, I'll just take care of him here,
Castle : you can come visit him whenever you can.
Alexis : So this dog you want to get, you know, for me?
