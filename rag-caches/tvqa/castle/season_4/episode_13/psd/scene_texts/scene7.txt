Beckett : Dr. Barker, what kind of issues was he dealing with?
Beckett : Did he ever exhibit signs of paranoia?
Barker : No. The occasional bout of depression,
Barker : which then led to low self-esteem, which led to binge eating.
Castle : An eating problem? You wouldn't know it to look at him.
Barker : His diet was horrible.
Barker : Oh! Scraps from the garbage, dead birds, even his own feces.
Castle : We're not talking about Francisco here, are we?
UNK: Oh!
Barker : You thought I was Francisco's therapist?
UNK: LAUGHING Heavens no, no. My patient is Royal.
Barker : Well, I am a canine therapist.
UNK: Yeah.
Barker : It'd be pretty crazy for me to treat people.
UNK: LAUGHING People. That would be crazy!
Beckett : Dr. Bark... Mrs. Barker,
Beckett : how did Francisco seem to you at Royal's last appointment?
Barker : Actually, he canceled it.
Beckett : Did he say why?
Barker : Just that something had come up,
UNK: and he had to be somewhere in a hurry.
Beckett : Okay, that's actually helpful.
UNK: Well.
BECKETT : Well, thank you.
Beckett : We'll contact you if we need anything further.
Barker : How is Royal doing?
Barker : Is it true that he was at the crime scene, that he witnessed the murder?
Castle : We think so, yes.
Barker : There may be things he saw.
UNK: Things he's trying to communicate about the crime.
Barker : If you let me see him, I can try to find out what he knows.
