Kay : What does this video have to do with anything?
UNK: This was about 15 minutes before you went backstage
Beckett : to Francisco Pilar's dressing room.
UNK: So?
Beckett : So we have reason to suspect that our killer was wearing your perfume.
Kay : Well, that's impossible. It wasn't even out yet.
Kay : I'm the only person that had it.
Ryan : Does she realize she just incriminated herself?
Esposito : I said she was nice. I didn't say anything about smart.
UNK: Customs Agent Weizer's on the phone for Detective Esposito.
UNK: Thanks.
Ryan : What was that about?
UNK: I asked him to call me if he found any definitive Kay Cappuccio connection
Esposito : to the Vasquez family.
