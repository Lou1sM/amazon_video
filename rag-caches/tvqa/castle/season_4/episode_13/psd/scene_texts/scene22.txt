UNK: MUFFLED COUGH
BECKETT : Are you sure about this?
Esposisto : Positive. Customs connected Kay to the Vasquez family, all right.
Esposisto : Through Reggie.
Esposisto : Turns out, he went to school with one of the Vasquez kids.
Esposisto : He's the connection, not Kay.
UNK: INDISTINCT
UNK: WOMEN SCREAM
UNK: BARKING
UNK: Get him, Royal.
UNK: GROANS
UNK: SNARLING AND BARKING
Beckett : So he confessed to the whole thing.
Wiser : The Vasquez cartel suspected that
Beckett : Francisco was training dogs for Customs.
Beckett : And then when Kay needed Lolita trained,
UNK: Reggie steered her towards Francisco and then wired the dog collar.
UNK: But Francisco caught on, and Reggie panicked.
Castle : He felt he had to protect the cartel.
Beckett : Yeah, and Reggie wanted to get in good with the cartel.
Beckett : He knew that his days of mooching off of Kay were almost over,
Beckett : in spite of all the reports that the two of them were getting married.
Castle : Whoa, whoa, you mean the tabloids were wrong?
Beckett : Yeah, and, you know, I was wrong about something, too.
Beckett : Turns out, having a mascot in the precinct can be pretty useful.
UNK: So I was thinking for tonight, maybe you take him home
UNK: and I'll swing by to pick him up, maybe 9 : 30?
UNK: Oh, I don't know, Castle.
Beckett : I don't know if this whole splitting time thing is a good long-term solution.
