Alexis : This wouldn't be an enticement to come home from college more often, would it?
Castle : Don't pretend like you're smarter than me. I taught you subtext, young lady.
Alexis : Don't worry. I'll come back and visit so much you'll be sick of me.
UNK: Promise?
Alexis : Yeah. Someone has to leave food out for you once in a while.
Castle : Speaking of, I'm kind of hungry right now.
Alexis : Kibbles 'n Bits?
Castle : Peanut butter on a spoon?
UNK: LAUGHS Chinese.
UNK: I'd like a sandwich.
Castle : Welcome home.
UNK: Yeah.
