Slaughter : That is sexy.
UNK: What?
UNK: You wanna hit me for that, too? No.
UNK: GROANS
Slaughter : That's for not having my back.
Slaughter : And if I ever see a character in one of your novels like me,
UNK: we're gonna have words.
UNK: So I'm gonna see you at the hearing on Tuesday, right?
Castle : You got it.
UNK: Outstanding.
UNK: Detective, you ever want to go out on a date
UNK: that ends in hot sex after a drunken fist fight,
Slaughter : you know where to find me.
Beckett : Yeah. In "never gonna happen" land.
UNK: HOARSELY Hey, thanks very much for your help.
Beckett : No problem, Castle. It's what partners are supposed to do.
Castle : Basking in the glory of you?
UNK: SIGHING No. Trying to figure out what to do.
Alexis : Stanford has always be en my dream school,
Alexis : but what if their initial rejection
Alexis : was the universe sending me a sign?
Alexis : That I'm better off somewhere else.
UNK: Do you think you'd be better off somewhere else?
Alexis : I don't know. Do you?
Castle : I don't know, either.
Castle : I guess the question is,
Castle : do you want it badly enough to get over being hurt?
Castle : You know what I think would help with this decision?
