Beckett : That maybe he's not ready?
UNK: SIGHS
Beckett : What if I waited too long?
Burke : You weren't waiting, Kate. You were healing.
Beckett : Yeah, but then in the meantime, he's moved on.
Burke : Or he's protecting himself by not taking more emotional risks.
Beckett : So then what do I do?
Burke : What do you want to do?
SLAUGHTER : I tell you what I'd do,
Slaughter : I'd go all caveman on that partner of yours.
Slaughter : Show her what time it is in Real Man Land.
Slaughter : Real Man Land?
UNK: Uh-huh.
Castle : Oh, is that what you were showing Laura
Castle : when we were back at the morgue?
UNK: I just throw a little attention her way, make her happy.
UNK: I'm macking on this hot new redhead
UNK: who just started working there.
Slaughter : That girl's barely street legal.
UNK: LAUGHS
UNK: Redhead? Yeah.
Castle : About 5'5", blue eyes? Intern?
Slaughter : Yeah. You know her?
Castle : That's my daughter. Seriously?
UNK: That girl got an ass.
UNK: GRUNTS
Slaughter : Hey, relax, Sherlock. CHUCKLES I'm just playing.
Castle : All right. As long as we're clear my daughter's off limits.
UNK: Yeah.
Slaughter : You pack a little punch there, for a writer.
UNK: PANTING
Slaughter : There's my guy.
UNK: Hold on, you stay here. Keep an eye out.
UNK: TIRES SCREECHING
UNK: GUNSHOTS
UNK: WOMAN SCREAMS
Castle : You okay?
Slaughter : I got a name.
UNK: What happened in there? Did you kill him?
Slaughter : You don't want to know. We were never here.
UNK: SCREECHING
Beckett : What are you doing? Jeez!
Castle : You okay?
Castle : That guy's insane.
Esposito : Yeah, I know. I tried to tell you.
Castle : No. He's insane.
UNK: Why? What did he do?
UNK: Jesus!
Castle : I can't talk now.
Esposito : I want those tickets.
UNK: Hey, what's up?
Martha : What were you talking about?
UNK: Where?
UNK: Oh, there. Um...
UNK: Nothing.
Castle : I mean, obviously, not nothing.
Castle : We were talking. We were just moving our...
Castle : I gotta go to the bathroom.
UNK: ELEVATOR DINGS
Beckett : What the hell?
Castle : I thought you killed him.
UNK: Yeah, you should've seen the look on your face
Slaughter : when I came out that door.
UNK: BOTH LAUGH
Castle : That's not funny.
Castle : That's not funny!
UNK: No, no, it's hysterical.
UNK: LAUGHING LOUDLY
UNK: Yeah.
UNK: Look at them, laughing it up.
UNK: Okay...
Ryan : Just acting like they own the place. I'm gonna say something.
Beckett : No, don't. It's not worth it.
UNK: RYAN SIGHS
Ryan : I feel like he's cheating on us.
Beckett : He's not cheating on us, Ryan. He's just branching out.
UNK: Hmm?
UNK: Mark Gibson : Don't take it personally, son.
UNK: Marc Gibson. I'm undercover on the Gang Task Force.
Slaughter : I had to make sure I could trust you,
Slaughter : that you'd have my back if things got ugly.
Slaughter : Luckily, you passed.
Mark : Well, you were right about the Jamaicans taking out Glitch.
Mark : Neighbors near the cemetery heard gunshots
UNK: on the night of the murder.
UNK: Source tells me
UNK: a low-level banger named Maxi was the one doing the shooting.
Mark : He's holed up in a building on Avenue A and Fifth.
Slaughter : Take a walk, fellas.
UNK: Maxi, why you gotta make this so hard, huh?
Slaughter : We both know you killed that Westie kid last night.
UNK: I want my lawyer.
Slaughter : Your lawyer. Sure, he's right in here.
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: SCREAMING Wait!
Castle : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Slaughter : Tell me you killed him, or they're gonna
UNK: have to hose you out of here, Maxi.
Maxy : I didn't kill no one!
Maxy : Wait! Wait! Wait!
UNK: I get a call that some Westie boy
UNK: was running his mouth about digging up our dead.
UNK: We gone to the cemetery to ambush him, but I never fire no shot.
Slaughter : Better stand back, this guy's gonna pop like a grape.
Maxy : No, wait! I swear! He wasn't alone.
Maxy : A group of Mexicans was waiting there
Maxy : next to a tricked out Escalade.
UNK: You telling me a third gang is involved in this?
Maxy : Man, I don't know who they are, man.
Maxy : But that Glitch clearly knew them.
UNK: He told them he had the heads, then things went south.
Maxy : The Mexicans opened fire on him
UNK: and took off running and so did I.
