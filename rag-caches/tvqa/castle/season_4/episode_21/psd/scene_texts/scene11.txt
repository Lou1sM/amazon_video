UNK: Then why didn't you take the heads?
Slaughter : That way none of this would come back on you and the Westies.
Brian : He vanished into the dark after I'd shot him.
UNK: SCOFFS
Brian : Even with his last breath, that boy managed to screw me up.
CASTLE : Well, at least you finally get a conviction on Brian.
UNK: That's gotta be some consolation.
Slaughter : Vales still walks.
Beckett : Excuse me.
UNK: Counselor, can I speak with your client for a second?
Vales : She probably wants my autograph.
Beckett : You feel cocky. I get it.
Beckett : You just dodged a murder rap.
UNK: Probably gonna go out tonigh and celebrate with your boys.
Beckett : And you should. Paint the town.
Beckett : But then, in the morning,
Beckett : I want you to get the hell out of my city.
Vales : But I like it here.
Slaughter : You might like it right now.
Beckett : But starting tomorrow, you're gonna see
Beckett : just how hard a city New York can be,
Beckett : when the full force of the NYPD comes crashing down on you
UNK: with 30,000 cops making it their daily duty
Beckett : to make your life a living hell.
