CASTLE : Okay, okay, okay,
Castle : so the Mexicans hunted down Glitch and they shot him.
Slaughter : Or he did and he's making up a story.
Slaughter : No, no, no, no. I can prove it.
Maxy : The Escalade had Texas plates.
UNK: I saw the first two letters. "R" and "X."
UNK: Okay, Maxi, but that license better check out
Slaughter : or I'm gonna come back here and recycle your ass.
UNK: It'll check. It'll check! It'll check, man, I swear.
UNK: Bye-bye. Slaughter!
UNK: Get me out of here! Help!
Castle : Another gang. That's plausible, right?
UNK: Yep. MAXI : Slaughter!
Slaughter : You threaten enough guys, you get a feel for their honesty.
Castle : But you wouldn't have really crushed him?
UNK: Of course not. It would have been more like a mangling.
MAXI : Slaughter!
UNK: Slaughter!
UNK: PHONE RINGING
Ryan : Detective Ryan. Yeah, it's Castle.
UNK: I have a partial Texas plate I need you to run.

Castle : Really? You too, huh?
Esposito : Get the Ferrari. You know, Castle,
Ryan : Jenny's been bugging me to set you up with her cousin, Ramona.
Ryan : She's a dental hygienist.
UNK: Mmm-hmm. Sounds good.
UNK: WHISPERS Ferrari.
Ryan : And I want the Ferrari for the weekend.
Castle : All right. Hey, and buddy, I am never going to forget this.
Castle : All right, we're all set.
Esposito : All right.
Slaughter : We'll get the results in the morning.
Slaughter : Tonight, we celebrate.
Castle : Celebrate what?
UNK: Well, you survived the first day on the job with me.
UNK: CHUCKLES Well, did you ever have a partner who didn't?
Castle : You know, I'd love to celebrate, but...
Slaughter : But what?
Castle : But nothing. But nothing. Let's...
Castle : Let's do this. What's the worst that can happen, right?
