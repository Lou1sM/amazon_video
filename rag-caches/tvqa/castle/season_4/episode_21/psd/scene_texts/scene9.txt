Castle : All this time you had my back?
Beckett : I had Ryan run a traffic cam search while he was pulling a plate?
Beckett : It's not a smoking gun, Castle.
Beckett : Okay? You can't even see Vales' face in that photo.
Beckett : It's not enough to change Slaughter's mind,
Beckett : unless you've got something else.
Castle : There is one more thing that doesn't make sense.
Castle : This is a map of the area.
UNK: Here's the cemetery, here's the overpass.
Castle : But to get to it, Glitch would have to climb a six-foot fence.
Castle : Why do that when there's a subway station a block away?
Castle : Why hide when you can run?
Beckett : Maybe we can find out.
CASTLE : According to the CSU report,
Castle : Glitch was shot somewhere around here.
Castle : He staggered away and ended up on the other side of that pillar.
Beckett : So you think that Vales' plan was
Beckett : to use Glitch and the Jamaican heads to start up a gang war?
Castle : Yeah. Why?
Beckett : I don't know, Castle. It's not what I'm seeing.
Beckett : Let's say I'm Vales,
Beckett : and I shoot Glitch to start that war.
Beckett : Where do you think would be the best spot to drop off that body?
Castle : In the middle of Westie territory.
Beckett : Exactly. So why did he leave it here?
Castle : Oh, crap.
UNK: Well,
Slaughter : imagine my surprise when I got to the station with my killer
Slaughter : and I hear you're stirring up my crime scene.
Castle : Okay, look, I can explain...
UNK: Save it. He doesn't know any better, but you do.
Beckett : What I know is that you coerced
Beckett : a confession out of an 18-year-old kid.
Slaughter : I didn't coerce jack.
Slaughter : He works for a guy who's got a trail of bodies
Slaughter : that stretches all the way back to the Rio Grande.
Slaughter : If he doesn't go down for this, the body count just grows.
UNK: We got a traffic video camera photo of Vales' Escalade
