Sophia : I'll just tell them how we all tried to stop it and couldn't.
Sophia : And the two of you were killed in the process by Danberg, of course.
UNK: But don't worry, I'll make it sound heroic.
Sophia : Your father will be very proud.
Castle : My father?
UNK: Well, you don't think you gained special access to the CIA back then
Sophia : because of your charm?
Gage : You really don't know, do you?
Sophia : I guess you never will.
UNK: No! GUNSHOT
UNK: Come on. It's just us, and we're out of time.
UNK: INDISTINCT
Beckett : Are you okay? He's fine.
UNK: He's good. Okay. You all right?
UNK: He's okay. You all right? Are you all right?
BECKETT : Yeah, maybe we should go outside. Come on. Yeah.
ESPOSITO : So what do you think this was all about?
Ryan : They didn't tell you?
UNK: What? Huh.
Esposito : They told you?
MARTIN : Once she turned me out,
Danberg : it didn't take long to put the pieces together.
Danberg : But all I could do was watch and wait for her to make her move.
Castle : Hard to believe she was a traitor. It was all an act.
MARTIN : Langley thinks she may have been a former KGB sleeper,
Danberg : set adrift when the Soviet Union broke up.
Danberg : Stayed with the company because she had nowhere else to go.
UNK: Until a better offer came along.
Beckett : Did you ever find out who she was working for? Who was behind Pandora?
Danberg : No, and even if I did, I couldn't tell you.
Castle : Agent Danberg,
Castle : Sophia said something,
Castle : something about my father being in the CIA.
Castle : Would you know anything about that?
Danberg : I'm afraid I don't. Sorry.
UNK: Oh. Detective Beckett, here.
