UNK: There he is.
UNK: His approach was to find a small event that could trigger a large event.
UNK: Blakely is the one who planned Pandora.
UNK: This is beyond a worst-case scenario.
Castle : Dr. Blakely, what's going on?
UNK: I found a linchpin that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.
Castle : Dr. Blakely. They're here.
BECKETT : Wait, wait! GUNSHOT
UNK: Beckett! Castle!
Castle : This door won't open.
Beckett : Yeah, mine won't either. I think the crash bent the frame.
Castle : We need something to break the glass.
Beckett : My gun.
UNK: Castle, I can't... I can't find it.
Beckett : I think it got knocked out when we got hit. Help me look for it.
UNK: GRUNTS
Beckett : I'm stuck.
Castle : What do you mean you're stuck?
Beckett : I mean, my belt is jammed. And the seat won't move.
Castle : What about a knife? You have a knife?
UNK: Yeah. In the trunk.
Beckett : Okay, look, we're running out of time.
Beckett : I need you to see if you can find that gun.
Beckett : And we'll just shoot the belt off.
Castle : I can't feel it. Castle.
Castle : Hang on, hang on.
UNK: Okay.
