Beckett : There is no big deal. Sleep with whoever you want.
Beckett : The more the merrier.
UNK: ALEXIS CLEARING THROAT
UNK: I have those toxicology reports you wanted.
LANIE : Oh, yes, just set them there, sweetie. Thank you.
Castle : So, enjoying your new internship?
Alexis : Well, I'm learning a lot.
Castle : Too much, I think.
Alexis : And I thought the dead bodies were going to be the grossest part.
Castle : Funny. Good night.
UNK: So, who was Beckett talking about?
Castle : None of your business. Now go to bed.
Alexis : The woman at the docks? Who is she?
Castle : Nobody. Now go to bed.
Alexis : I saw the way you looked at her. She's not nobody.
Castle : Well, it doesn't matter who she is
Castle : because I'm never going to see her again.
Castle : Now go to bed.
Alexis : You know, if you're going to keep secrets from me,
Alexis : I might start keeping secrets from you, too.
Castle : At your age, I'm thinking that might be a good idea.
UNK: Sophia.
Sophia : Hello, Rick.
UNK: How... When... How did you get in here?
Sophia : I'm CIA.
Sophia : So, they're turning them into graphic novels now?
UNK: Yeah.
Castle : First one did well, so they're gonna do another.
Sophia : So what do you think? She look like me?
Danberg : What are you doing here?
Sophia : You're going after Gage, aren't you?
Castle : No, we're off the case, remember?
Sophia : You used to be a better liar.
UNK: Yeah.
Sophia : I know you've been looking into Blakely's aliases.
