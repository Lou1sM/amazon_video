Gage : Something's wrong,
Gage : and if you don't figure out what,
UNK: you're not gonna survive the week.
UNK: Now someone is trying to send this world spiraling towards war,
Gage : and they want me to take the fall.
Gage : But neither of those things are gonna happen.
Gage : Now, I need you to tell me what the name of the target is.
Castle : Look, let me call my CIA contact.
Castle : She can help us. No.
Gage : Everything indicates that Pandora is being funded
UNK: by military-industrial concerns linked with Eastern Europe.
Gage : They can't pull off this operation, all right?
Gage : Not without help from the inside.
UNK: Detective, don't you get it?
Gage : My own people are setting me up,
UNK: and they're not gonna stop until I'm dead because I'm the diversion.
Gage : Look, if everyone's trying to stop me...
UNK: Then no one's trying to stop Pandora.
