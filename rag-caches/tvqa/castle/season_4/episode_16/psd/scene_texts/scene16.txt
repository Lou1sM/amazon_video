Gage : I don't have a partner.
UNK: The guy out there, the one that killed McGrath and Blakely
Gage : and drove your friends into the water,
Gage : the one carrying out Operation Pandora?
Gage : He's not with me.
Gage : I saw him at the docks. The way he moved, he's with you.
Gage : He's CIA.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
BECKETT : Are you sure he's lying?
Beckett : He's not expressing any of the physiological traits.
UNK: He's trained to lie without betraying himself.
Danberg : He wants to divide us, make us suspicious of each other.
Danberg : Trust me, there's no mole but him.
Castle : What if you're wrong? What if he's telling the truth?
Sophia : That is immaterial. Right now, there is someone else out there
Sophia : who is preparing to go through with Pandora.
Sophia : And that girl is the key. We need to find her.
UNK: Tech 2 : Still negative on all databases.
UNK: If she's a foreign national, she might not be in any of ours.
Castle : What about her school uniform? Can you identify her through that?
UNK: Tech 2 : We tried. There's not enough of the crest visible to identify it.
Beckett : Do you really buy this?
