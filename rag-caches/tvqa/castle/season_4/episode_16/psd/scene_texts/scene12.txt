Ryan : And he never mentioned any family or friends?
UNK: No. Anywhere he might have shopped?
Beckett : Anything that might indicate where he lived?
UNK: No, but I think he lived in Union Square.
UNK: And what makes you say that?
Yanni : After one of our walks,
UNK: I discovered I'd left my chess set in the park.
Yanni : And on my way back, I saw him head into a building there.
Beckett : Do you think you can identify that building for us?
Yanni : I think so.
Beckett : I gotta borrow your car.
Super : Yeah, this is his place right here.
Super : But he said his name was Finley, not Blakely or McGregor.
UNK: Thanks.
UNK: Kevin Ryan : What are we looking for?
Beckett : Papers, computers, phone records, bills.
UNK: Anything that'll help us figure out what he was up to.
UNK: Beckett.
Castle : Think I found it.
BECKETT : What the hell?
UNK: INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER STATIC BUZZING
UNK: "Tax riots"?
UNK: "European economic collapse."
CASTLE : "Iran invades Iraq"?
BECKETT : "Syria moves on Israel."
UNK: "US commits troops to Taiwan."
BECKETT : "US commits troops to Middle East."
UNK: "Russia moves on Eastern Europe."
UNK: What kind of an outcome was this linchpin supposed to create?
Beckett : End of our country as we know it.
Castle : Third World War.
BECKETT : This can't be real. No one can predict all of this.
Castle : Maybe not, but a bunch of people smarter than us think he can.
Sophia : He was killed to cover it up.
Castle : Over here.
UNK: The dominoes would just never stop falling.
Alexis : Who is she?
Beckett : I don't know, but this is it.
Castle : She's the linchpin.
Castle : The first domino to fall that leads to war.
UNK: I have to call them. They have to know.
GAGE : Put the phone down.
UNK: GUN COCKS BECKETT : Gage?
Gage : Put the phone down now.
Gage : Now run.
UNK: What? Run!
UNK: MACHINE GUN FIRING
UNK: CAR ALARMS WAILING
Beckett : I thought you were the bad guy.
Gage : If I were the bad guy, you'd be dead by now.
Gage : This way. No, my car is out front.
Gage : They're watching your car. You go that way and you'll die.
Castle : Who's out there? Who are they?
Gage : You can have answers or you can live. Your choice.
Gage : Stay down.
Castle : We need to call our CIA contact.
Castle : We need to tell them what's going on.
Gage : No calls.
Beckett : Where are we?
Gage : Someplace safe, but we don't have much time.
Gage : All right, I've been on the grid. I've heard the chatter.
Gage : Whatever this is, it's going down tomorrow.
Gage : Now, you got to Blakely's before me. Who's the target?
Beckett : Why did you kill Blakely and McGrath?
Gage : I didn't.
UNK: Come on, you really want me to take that gun away from you again?
Gage : We don't have the time.
Castle : Make time.
UNK: SIGHS
Gage : Look, as an asset you have to develop certain survival skills, all right?
Gage : Chief of which is the ability to know
Gage : something's wrong without knowing why.
Gage : It's always something small.
Gage : A static pop on your safe house phone,
UNK: a slight delay in authorization using your credit cards,
Gage : or the almost imperceptible pauses in conversations with your handler.
