Beckett : He was protecting his op.
Sophia : He was ascertaining how much we knew before he killed you.
Castle : Well, if you're right, and the attack on us was staged,
UNK: then he can't be working alone.
Castle : Gage must have a partner.
Sophia : Which means it's not over.
UNK: The fire crews were unable to contain the blaze in Blakely's apartment.
