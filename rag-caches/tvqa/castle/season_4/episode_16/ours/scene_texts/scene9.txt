UNK: Castle!
UNK: Sorry.
Danberg : What are you doing?
BECKETT : Danberg wasn't the mole, was he?
Castle : You are.
Sophia : Go kill the girl. I'll take care of these two.
Castle : It was you this whole time?
Sophia : I'm afraid so.
Castle : Then why bring us here? Why not just leave us at the facility?
Sophia : Because you just don't stop.
Sophia : You need to know the story. The whole story.
UNK: And if something doesn't add up, you just don't let go.
Sophia : Why do you think I brought you inside? I was protecting the op.
BECKETT : Like you were trying to protect the operation
Beckett : when you killed Blakely and McGrath?
Castle : You set up Gage.
Sophia : For the linchpin to work, the Chinese have to blame the US government.
Sophia : The operation has to trace back to the CIA.
UNK: And when you needed to cover your tracks, you killed him.
UNK: So then you needed someone else, you needed Danberg.
UNK: Sophia, World War III? Why?
Sophia : Let's just say there are certain parties
Sophia : who will pay anything to reshape the world.
CASTLE : I don't buy it.
Castle : The Sophia I know wouldn't sell out her country.
Castle : Not for money, not for anything.
UNK: SOPHIA LAUGHS
Sophia : Well, that's one thing you got wrong, Rick.
UNK: SPEAKING RUSSIAN
Sophia : On your knees. Right now. Both of you.
Sophia : I'll just tell them how we all tried to stop it and couldn't.
Sophia : And the two of you were killed in the process by Danberg, of course.
UNK: But don't worry, I'll make it sound heroic.
Sophia : Your father will be very proud.
Castle : My father?
UNK: Well, you don't think you gained special access to the CIA back then
Sophia : because of your charm?
Gage : You really don't know, do you?
Sophia : I guess you never will.
UNK: No! GUNSHOT
UNK: Come on. It's just us, and we're out of time.
