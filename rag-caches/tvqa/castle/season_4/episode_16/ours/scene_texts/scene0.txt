UNK: There he is.
UNK: His approach was to find a small event that could trigger a large event.
UNK: Blakely is the one who planned Pandora.
UNK: This is beyond a worst-case scenario.
Castle : Dr. Blakely, what's going on?
UNK: I found a linchpin that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.
Castle : Dr. Blakely. They're here.
BECKETT : Wait, wait! GUNSHOT
UNK: Beckett! Castle!
Castle : This door won't open.
Beckett : Yeah, mine won't either. I think the crash bent the frame.
Castle : We need something to break the glass.
Beckett : My gun.
UNK: Castle, I can't... I can't find it.
Beckett : I think it got knocked out when we got hit. Help me look for it.
UNK: GRUNTS
Beckett : I'm stuck.
Castle : What do you mean you're stuck?
Beckett : I mean, my belt is jammed. And the seat won't move.
Castle : What about a knife? You have a knife?
UNK: Yeah. In the trunk.
Beckett : Okay, look, we're running out of time.
Beckett : I need you to see if you can find that gun.
Beckett : And we'll just shoot the belt off.
Castle : I can't feel it. Castle.
Castle : Hang on, hang on.
UNK: Okay.
UNK: Look, stay here.
Castle : I found it!
UNK: MUFFLED SHOUT
UNK: Castle.
UNK: Castle!
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: MUFFLED GUNSHOTS
UNK: CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO
CASTLE : I guess the good thing about having your daughter at crime scenes
UNK: is she can bring you dry clothes.
UNK: Thanks.
Beckett : And thanks.
Castle : You would've done the same for me.
Beckett : Yeah. Probably.
UNK: LAUGHS I'm just glad you found my gun.
Castle : That whole sinking car thing?
UNK: Much cooler in the movies than it is in real life.
Beckett : And for the record, I prefer watching spy thrillers to being in them.
UNK: Javier Esposito : So, tell me, how can your victim look like Nelson Blakely
