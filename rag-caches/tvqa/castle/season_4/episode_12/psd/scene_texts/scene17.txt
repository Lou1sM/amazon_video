Beckett : Laura received numerous phone calls from her.
UNK: Which made poor Greta look pretty frisky
UNK: until we realized you'd been housesitting at her apartment.
UNK: STAMMERS I may have called that service from time to time.
UNK: But I never knew who I was talking to. I mean, how would I?
BECKETT : We'll get to that in a minute.
Beckett : In the meantime, we checked your phone records
Beckett : and you sent this text to a burner cell about a month ago.
Beckett : Now, to most people that would look like a series of random numbers.
Beckett : So we looked into it.
Beckett : Those are actually numbers to a bank account
Beckett : for Mayor Weldon and his charity.
Beckett : Numbers that someone could've used
Beckett : to make it look like the mayor was embezzling money.
UNK: The man who trusted you. And you sold him out.
