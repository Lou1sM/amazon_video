Sarah : I told her it was completely against policy.
Sarah : But she was desperate. She said it was a matter of life and death.
UNK: Okay, we're gonna need that client's name.
Beckett : Edgar Navarro?
Edgar : I didn't do nothing.
Edgar : You had no right to drag me out in front of my mom's.
UNK: No?
Beckett : Where were you last night between 8 : 00 and 10 : 00?
Edgar : What's this about?
Beckett : Do you recognize this woman?
UNK: Hey, look, I don't know what she told you,
Edgar : but all we did was talk.
Edgar : I didn't do nothing illegal.
Beckett : Then how come she's dead?
UNK: STAMMERS What?
Beckett : We know that she called you, Edgar.
Beckett : And that the two of you met up.
Edgar : It's not what you think. She just needed my help.
Beckett : What kind of help could you have given her?
Edgar : I learned how to fix computers in prison.
Castle : That's why Laura called me.
Edgar : She needed me to copy some digital recordings for her from their hard drive,
Edgar : but she didn't know how to rip them.
Edgar : I told her I needed the file extensions.
UNK: She said she'd get them, then call me from her cell to walk her through it.
Beckett : Only she didn't even own a cell, Edgar.
Edgar : Yes, she did.
Edgar : That's her number right there.
Beckett : Did she tell you why she needed those files copied?
Edgar : Said she'd heard something on a call.
Edgar : Something she wasn 't supposed to hear.
