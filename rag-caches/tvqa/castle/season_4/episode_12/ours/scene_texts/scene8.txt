Ryan : a volunteer at Reading Train.
Weldon : I didn't recognize her. But in context, I remember her.
Weldon : This event was a few nights ago.
Weldon : She was trying to talk to me, but...
Ryan : Did she? Talk to you?
Weldon : No, I got pulled away. I had donors I had to speak with.
Weldon : I remember her saying that she wanted to talk to me,
Weldon : but circumstances prevented it.
Castle : So you and Laura never actually spoke?
UNK: No. Not even on the phone?
Weldon : No. Honestly, after that night I never gave her a second thought.
Beckett : You know, in this photo, you're wearing a light brown cashmere coat.
Beckett : We'd like you to turn it over to CSU for testing.
UNK: SIGHS
Weldon : Respectfully, I'm going to have to decline.
UNK: Why?
Castle : Robert, give her the coat. It can only be good for you.
Weldon : I'm afraid I can't do that.
UNK: Why?
Weldon : I had nothing to do with Laura Cambridge's murder,
Weldon : or the theft of money from my charity
Weldon : or anything else I've been accused of in the last 48 hours.
Weldon : Do you think that any of this is a coincidence?
UNK: Robert... No, me here, talking to you.
Weldon : This is exactly what they wanted to have happen.
Weldon : So, no, I will not give you my coat.
UNK: There's a conspiracy against me, and I will not voluntarily feed it.
Castle : What conspiracy?
Weldon : Don't you think it's funny that all this is happening
Weldon : the moment I consider running for governor?
Weldon : Rick, I'm used to having enemies,
Weldon : but this is an organized effort to destroy me.
Weldon : So right now, I don't trust anyone.
Castle : Well, he has good reason to not turn over his coat.
Beckett : Yes, guilt.
Castle : A conspiracy. Is it so far-fetched?
