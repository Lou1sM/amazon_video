CASTLE : He let her say a prayer before he shot her.
Castle : That's not very professional.
UNK: No.
Beckett : More like Jane knew her killer.
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : When I didn't hear from her last night, I knew something was wrong.
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : We always talked at the end of the day.
Beckett : Mrs. Herzfeld, Jane was tutoring people to make extra cash.
UNK: Do you know why she canceled all of her appointments yesterday?
UNK: EXHALES
CASTLE : Is it possible that Jane was doing somethin other than tutoring?
Castle : Something that might have gotten her into trouble?
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : Something like what?
Beckett : Look, we didn't find any drugs in Jane's system,
Beckett : but the ME did find traces of cocaine on her clothes.
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : Jane would never be involved with drugs!
Beckett : Yeah, but she might have been involved with people who were,
Beckett : and we think that she knew her killer.
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : There was a boyfriend I didn't like.
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : They broke up five months ago.
Beckett : And what did you not like about him?
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : He wouldn't meet my eye.
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : They would fight.
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : I saw bruises on her.
Beckett : Do you remember his name?
UNK: Finbar Joseph McQueen, aka Finn.
UNK: Did a deuce on cocaine charges. Possession with intent.
UNK: Well, that could explain the residue Lanie found on her body.
Castle : B and E. Simple assault. There's nothing gun related.
Beckett : Maybe he decided to step up the game.
Beckett : Do we have a location on this guy?
Ryan : Yeah, that's the best part. I talked to McQueen's parole officer.
Ryan : He says that McQueen is doing a job at 645 West 98th Street.
UNK: Construction.
Finn : I can't believe it. I can't believe she's dead.
RYAN : When was the last time you saw Jane?
UNK: A couple of weeks ago.
UNK: But you broke up in April. So you stayed in touch?
UNK: STAMMERING I was her friend, yeah.
UNK: I help her out every now and then.
Finn : I lent her money once. She paid me back. You know, like that.
RYAN : Did Jane have money problems?
ESPOSITO : And as a friend, did you maybe tell her
UNK: that you could hook her up? CELL PHONE RINGING
Esposito : Got her involved in something she couldn't handle?
FINN : Jane would never do anything that wasn't legit...
UNK: Beckett.
Finn : ...if that's what you're implying.
Finn : Jane was a good girl.
UNK: What?
Beckett : Are you sure?
Beckett : And there's no chance that's a mistake?
Finn : I kept telling her,
Finn : this is who I am.
UNK: RAPPING ON GLASS
ESPOSITO : Don't move.
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: THUDDING
UNK: My man Finn, inches from confessing.
UNK: What?
Ryan : What's going on?
Beckett : Ballistics just came in.
Beckett : The bullet that killed Jane Herzfeld
UNK: is from a gun that's in our system.
Beckett : It's a Glock 17.
Esposito : That's good news.
Beckett : Ryan, it's a match to your old service weapon.
Ryan : That can't be right.
BECKETT : It's not a mistake.
Beckett : The weapon that killed Jane Herzfeld,
Beckett : it's yours.
UNK: HORNS BLARING
UNK: VOICES OVERLAPPING
UNK: BELL TOLLING
RYAN : She was holding a cross in her hand when she died.
Ryan : She was praying for mercy.
Beckett : And then, she heard him pull the trigger
Ryan : of my gun.
Ryan : We were working the 3XK serial murders last year.
UNK: We had a suspect in custody who had given us a full confession.
Ryan : At which time Castle and I went to the motel...
UNK: Captain Gates : Castle was with you?
Beckett : Yeah, the NYPD sequestered Jerry Tyson at a motel as a witness,
Beckett : and Castle and Ryan went over there to give him the all clear.
Gates : At which time you realized that Tyson actually was 3XK.
