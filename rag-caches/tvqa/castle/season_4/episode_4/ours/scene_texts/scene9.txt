Esposito : Yo, what's good, son? I ain't seen you in a minute, man.
Ben : He thinks I'm my brother. It happens with the gweilo.
Esposito : What's up? Just move along.
UNK: Hey, man, why are you touching up on me?
Esposito : Hey, man, you better check your totem.
UNK: Hey, Philip, tell him that we boys.

UNK: Let's go outside. You can call Philip on his cell.
UNK: Hey, Philip, tell him. Man, you changed, Philip.
UNK: Get off me!
UNK: DOOR SHUTS
Ryan : Hey, Ben.
Ben : You shouldn't be here.
UNK: I just wanna talk.
Ben : About what?
UNK: Clifford Lee : About Jane.
Ben : Jane is dead.
UNK: So you let it all just die with her?
Ryan : What happened, huh?
Ryan : College maybe got you thinking that
Ryan : there's something better out there
UNK: than being just a lowlife drug dealer?
Ryan : Jane made you really want to try?
Ryan : You can still get out. And I promise you'll be safe.
Ben : You cops and your promises, man.
Ben : Carver promised Jane she'd be safe. Look what happened.
Ben : You're talking about my family.
Ryan : I'm talking about your life.
Ryan : Jane died fighting your battle.
Ryan : I know you can honor her better than this.
UNK: DOOR OPENS
UNK: FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING
Ryan : You know how to find me.
Beckett : What the hell were you two thinking,
Beckett : going to see Ben Lee when Gates
Beckett : specifically said, "Stay away"?
UNK: Who's gonna tell her, Beckett? Not me.
Esposito : Ryan, are you planning on telling the Captain what we did?
Ryan : Not me. Castle?
Castle : Who, me? No way. CLICKS
UNK: Nice, smart ass.
Beckett : And what about when Ben Lee talks to his dad
Beckett : and Gates gets a phone call from their lawyer?
UNK: You two are gonna get benched.
Ryan : Ben Lee's not gonna tell his father.
Beckett : How do you know? Because.
Ryan : I looked him in the eye, and I saw the pain he's in.
Ryan : Maybe he's not man enough to stand up for himself,
UNK: but he's not gonna rat me out either.
Beckett : You guys took a hell of a chance.
Ryan : Beckett, you're starting to sound like a boss.
Beckett : Just let me know next time so I can help...
GATES : Detective Ryan.
Gates : There's someone here to see you.
UNK: CHUCKLES
UNK: INDISTINCT VOICES ON HEADPHONES
Phillip : Papa said you were down here.
UNK: You're a senior now. You don't need to work this hard.
BEN : I have a test on Monday.
PHILIP : Blow it off. We'll go out.
BEN : I don't want to go.
UNK: Philip.
UNK: If they hadn't found Jane, if she'd stayed hidden,
UNK: I never would have known what happened to her.
Ben : Would you really have let me wonder for the rest of my life?
Phillip : Sometimes it's a gift, not knowing the truth.
Ben : So if she were just missing,
UNK: I could believe that she were alive somewhere?
Ben : I could pretend? Like a child?
UNK: She's not missing!
Esposito : I don't like this.
UNK: Ben is supposed to lead Philip to
Castle : a confession, not force a confrontation.
Beckett : You guys, just give him a minute.
Finn : She's dead, and I'm not a child.
Phillip : In time, you'll see it was for the best.
UNK: Philip's dancing around it.
UNK: But the second he acknowledges guilt, we're moving in.
UNK: Come on, come on.
UNK: Did she cry? Did she ask for me?
UNK: Ben, don't do this.
Ben : I need to know.
UNK: You're not thinking clearl We'll talk about this tomorrow.
