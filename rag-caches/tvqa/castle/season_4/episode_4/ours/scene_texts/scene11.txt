Ben : I don't need to prove anything to you.
UNK: Ben!
UNK: This is your last chance, little brother.
Phillip : Show me. GUN COCKS
Ryan : Let's go. Let's move!
UNK: You're gonna shoot me now? Like you did Jane?
Phillip : Don't push me.
Ben : Go to hell.
UNK: Drop the gun, get on the ground, now!
UNK: Drop the gun, get down, now!
UNK: Get on the ground! Get down! Get down!
UNK: Traitor!
UNK: SCREAMS IN CANTONESE
Ben : You ruined my life! GUN COCKS
Phillip : No, no.
UNK: Ben, put down the gun.
UNK: No!
UNK: No! Ben! No!
Phillip : No! No!
UNK: Oh, God! Ben!
Phillip : Ben! Ben!
UNK: INDISTINCT
RYAN : Oh, God, I am so sorry.
BECKETT : There's enough on the tape
Beckett : to sway a jury from reasonable doubt.
UNK: And the coke that we found in your car
Beckett : is a match for the residue found on Jane's body.
Beckett : And then there's this.
Beckett : The gun that you pointed at your brother.
Beckett : Detective Ryan positively identified
Beckett : it as his stolen service weapon.
Beckett : It is also the same gun that was used to kill Jane Herzfeld.
Beckett : You're looking at murder one. Life with no parole.
Attorney : My client has some information that might interest the NYPD.
BECKETT : What kind of information?
PHILIP : Jerry Tyson.
UNK: 3XK.
Beckett : What about him?
Phillip : When he gave me the gun, we talked.
Phillip : I know where he was headed and what name he's gonna use.
Beckett : So, Lee wants 15 to 25,
Beckett : with parole in 10 for giving us Tyson's new alias.
UNK: And I need to give the ADA a recommendation.
Beckett : This might be our chance to get 3XK, Castle.
UNK: No.
UNK: It's a set up.
UNK: Jerry Tyson gave that gun to Philip Lee, knowing he would use it.
UNK: So there's a good chance he knew we'd eventually get to Philip.
Beckett : Maybe. So what?
Castle : So nothing Tyson told Phil would be the truth.
UNK: Giving Philip Lee a good dea for bad information,
Castle : that's just another win for Jerry Tyson.
Beckett : Are you sure?
Castle : Sure enough.
Ryan : Jane Herzfeld deserves justice.
Castle : Life in prison for Philip Lee. No deals.
Castle : We'll get 3XK,
Castle : and we'll do it right.
Beckett : Damn, Castle, look at you thinking like a real cop.
Beckett : Hey, guys.
Beckett : Hey, you could look a little happier.
UNK: Tonight was a win, right?
UNK: SIGHS
Ryan : Well, I keep thinking about Seth Carver,
Ryan : sending Jane into the Lees all alone, no backup.
Ryan : Do I really get to call myself a better cop?
Castle : You are a better cop, Kevin.
Castle : You're a better man.
Castle : Because you didn't send him in there alone.
Esposito : Hey, there's your boy.
UNK: Ben.
Ryan : Good to see you back on your feet.
ESPOSITO : That was a pretty impressive performance back there.
Castle : Yes, you have a future in stunt work, my friend.
RYAN : Guys, this is Marshall Mike Drooen from Witness Protection.
Ryan : He's escorting Ben to his new home in Los Angeles.
UNK: Detectives.
UNK: Mike Drooen : Ben, your plane leaves in an hour.
UNK: Thanks, I just need a minute.
Castle : Thank you.
Ben : I wouldn't have had the courage to do what I did without you.
Ryan : Well, you have your life back now.
Ryan : Live it on your own terms.
Ryan : It's what she wanted.
UNK: CASTLE CLEARS THROAT
UNK: Oh!
UNK: Let's keep this party a little quiet, though, all right?
Castle : If the Captain hears, I'm sure she'll blame me.
BECKETT : Who's gonna tell her? Not me, you?
UNK: Nope. What about you, Ryan?
UNK: Mmm-mmm. Well, then, I think we're good.
Esposito : Well, then, to my partner, Kevin Ryan, a credit to the job.
Gates : To Ryan.
Gates : To Ryan.
Ryan : I'd like to make a toast.
Ryan : To bravery and commitment,
Ryan : to love and sacrifice.
Beckett : To Jane.
ALL : To Jane.
