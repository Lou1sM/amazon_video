Seth : and all of them said that Jane was an angel. Am I right?
UNK: So you're saying she wasn't?
Seth : I'm saying that when I met her,
Seth : I was pulling her over for blowing a red light,
UNK: and she had two grams in the glove compartment.
Ryan : Jane didn't do drugs.
UNK: What can I tell you? Little miss was riding dirty.
Ryan : You didn't charge her. There's nothing in the system.
UNK: Right.
Seth : That's because when I asked her where the coke came from,
Seth : she told me Ben Lee gave it to her.
Ryan : Who's Ben Lee? SETH : Who's Ben...
UNK: SCOFFS
Seth : Son of Clifford Lee.
Seth : He's the head of the Han Yi Tong.
Seth : Operates out of a dim sum house on Mott Street.
UNK: What's the Han Yi Tong?
Beckett : Tongs are a Chinese merchant organization.
Beckett : Most of them are legit, but some of them are a fro for the Chinese mob.
Castle : So Clifford Lee would be like the Godfather.
