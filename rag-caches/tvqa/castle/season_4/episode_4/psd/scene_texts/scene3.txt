FINN : Jane would never do anything that wasn't legit...
UNK: Beckett.
Finn : ...if that's what you're implying.
Finn : Jane was a good girl.
UNK: What?
Beckett : Are you sure?
Beckett : And there's no chance that's a mistake?
Finn : I kept telling her,
Finn : this is who I am.
UNK: RAPPING ON GLASS
ESPOSITO : Don't move.
UNK: GRUNTS
UNK: THUDDING
UNK: My man Finn, inches from confessing.
UNK: What?
Ryan : What's going on?
Beckett : Ballistics just came in.
