Ryan : I'm answering phones in the squad.
UNK: There's a girl on the line, name of Alisha, asking for my lieutenant.
Ryan : So I call out across the bullpen,
UNK: "Hey, Loo, Alisha's on the phone for you."
UNK: It was her tip that got these guys nailed,
Ryan : and all of them just heard me call out her name.
Ryan : Searched all day and all night, looking for her
Ryan : before the gang could get word back
Ryan : to the street that she was a narc.
Beckett : Well, did you find her?
UNK: Mrs Herzfeld : I did.
Ryan : Got her into Witness Protection.
UNK: But that was the stupidest thing I'd ever done as a cop.
Ryan : Until the day Jerry Tyson got the drop on me and stole my weapon.
Ryan : Carver is a jerk,
Ryan : but he's got a point.
