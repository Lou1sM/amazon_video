UNK: FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING
Ryan : You know how to find me.
Beckett : What the hell were you two thinking,
Beckett : going to see Ben Lee when Gates
Beckett : specifically said, "Stay away"?
UNK: Who's gonna tell her, Beckett? Not me.
Esposito : Ryan, are you planning on telling the Captain what we did?
Ryan : Not me. Castle?
Castle : Who, me? No way. CLICKS
UNK: Nice, smart ass.
Beckett : And what about when Ben Lee talks to his dad
Beckett : and Gates gets a phone call from their lawyer?
UNK: You two are gonna get benched.
Ryan : Ben Lee's not gonna tell his father.
Beckett : How do you know? Because.
Ryan : I looked him in the eye, and I saw the pain he's in.
Ryan : Maybe he's not man enough to stand up for himself,
UNK: but he's not gonna rat me out either.
Beckett : You guys took a hell of a chance.
