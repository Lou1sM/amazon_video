Attorney : we'll sue the department for harassment.
UNK: All right. Okay, we got it.
GATES : This is the second time you've gone at the Lees with nothing.
UNK: Now Philip Lee has lawyered up,
Gates : he's probably gotten rid of the gun,
Gates : and he has four family members and various household help
Gates : willing to alibi him for the time of the murder.
Ryan : The cell phone puts him in the vicinity of the murder scene.
UNK: Vicinity. Finn McQueen says...
Gates : Finn McQueen cannot testify to what happened, Castle.
Gates : He wasn't there.
Gates : Make your case,
Gates : but you do it now, without harassing the Lee family.
Beckett : Sir, we need to keep leaning on them. We need to keep the heat on.
Gates : No, you need to stay away. And that's an order.
Beckett : So, what? We just write the name
Ryan : of Jane's killer in a file and we let him walk free?
