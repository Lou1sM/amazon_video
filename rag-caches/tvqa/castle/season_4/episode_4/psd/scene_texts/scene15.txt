UNK: Come on.
Beckett : You know what Carver could have a point about, is Ben Lee.
Beckett : If Ben did tip to Jane, then that's a strong motive.
Beckett : You up for a trip to Chinatown?
Ryan : Hell yeah.
Esposito : Yo, Uniforms at Grand Central caught a break.
Esposito : They found a clerk who works at a mailbox center around the corner
Esposito : who says he rented a box to Jane on the day she died.
Esposito : I'm going to go check it out. You wanna roll with me?
Ryan : No, I'm with Beckett.
UNK: Castle, you wanna come?
UNK: Huh?
Castle : I was just thinking.
Castle : If our killer is someone in Lee's organization,
UNK: then he must've gotten your gun from Jerry Tyson.
Ryan : Which means our killer may know Tyson's whereabouts.
