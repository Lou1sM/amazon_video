Ryan : That makes us clerks, not cops.
Gates : Take the rest of the day off, Ryan.
Gates : You need to clear your head.
ESPOSITO : It's not over yet, bro.
UNK: We just need someone to go on record.
Ryan : Someone who knows what happened that night.
UNK: Yeah, the only one who really knows is Philip Lee.
UNK: Where you going?
UNK: I'm gonna do just like the Captain said, take the rest of the day off.
Esposito : Hey. Wherever you're going, I'm going with you.
UNK: It's my fight.
Esposito : And you don't want me getting involved.
Esposito : It's my case, too.
Esposito : And you're my partner.
Ryan : I'm taking a run at Ben Lee.
Esposito : The Lees will have him locked down.
Esposito : I'm betting his old man won't let him go out in public alone.
Ryan : Then I guess we can't go in there looking like cops.
UNK: Oh, shnap! Is that Philip?
Esposito : Yo, what's good, son? I ain't seen you in a minute, man.
Ben : He thinks I'm my brother. It happens with the gweilo.
Esposito : What's up? Just move along.
UNK: Hey, man, why are you touching up on me?
Esposito : Hey, man, you better check your totem.
UNK: Hey, Philip, tell him that we boys.
Esposito : Tell your boy, Thor, that we boys.
UNK: Let's go outside. You can call Philip on his cell.
UNK: Hey, Philip, tell him. Man, you changed, Philip.
UNK: Get off me!
UNK: DOOR SHUTS
Ryan : Hey, Ben.
Ben : You shouldn't be here.
UNK: I just wanna talk.
Ben : About what?
UNK: Clifford Lee : About Jane.
Ben : Jane is dead.
